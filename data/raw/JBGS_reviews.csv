The accounting and tax departments struggle to retain people, with turnover greater than what is typically seen in the Big 4. People staying longer than a year is rare. Given the company's poor reputation in the employment marketplace, they cannot attract the level of talent necessary to function so dysfunction continues unabated.

If you want to move up you must brown nose and show face in the office after hours and on weekends. Quantity of hours is more important than quality of work. Environment is competitive and toxic, resulting in high turnover of staff. Employees at the next level down avoid making decisions and prefer to throw their own team under the bus than to stick up for them.

It's very transparent what teams and departments are valued (i.e. asset management is a priority, accounting is not, etc.) and if you're not in one of the favored departments you won't have any room for growth. The only way to get your value recognized is to a) be a favorite of the executive over your department or b) threaten to leave. Communication between departments is abysmal. You'll be overworked and severely underpaid. Your work life balance depends on your manager; some are better than others.

PTO is good but high turnover and being short staffed means you never get to use it.,"Our office was acquired by JBG and everyone’s offer to stay with the community contained flat out lies; there were huge pay cuts, the job itself got far more difficult and unorganized, and 45-50 hour work weeks with no lunch breaks became the norm. Borderline Fair Housing violations were common in bad practices that allowed opportunities for some residents and not others in obscure “customer service gestures”. Over time, management implemented a cycle of requiring lower staff to enforce policies that they would then waive entirely when speaking to residents themselves, as if to deliberately make subordinate staff appear incompetent, uncaring, and mean in the eyes of residents.

Hostile Work environment,1.0,"Apr 20, 2022",good benefits. COVID regulations are ok. Bonuses are nice.,"High turnover meaning job responsibilities overlap. favoritism is real, meaning that management won't take you serious when you are being treated badly by other employers. You will see that HR may respond to this review stating that employers are encouraged to contact when in fact we are actually shushed away by ""warnings"" so if you speak up against abuse you will be reprimanded instead. Pay is not worth it for the treatment you get here. The job itself is very overwhelming because they expect you to do your job while doing the job of others (in this case management) In my time here, I had seen two employers had breakdowns and walk out the job. When you mention this to management all they say is ""okay"" and then side with the abuser.

High Recommend!,5.0,"Mar 15, 2022",JBGS promotes a high level of work/life balance. They encourage their employees to take much needed time off while still meeting goals and deadlines.

Fantastic Entry-Level Job,5.0,"Aug 25, 2020","Corporate has an awesome atmosphere, everyone is motivated, energetic, and ambitious. Great learning opportunities, and obvious room for growth/promotion since the company is rapidly growing/expanding. Coming from a company with a weak HR department, it's also refreshing to see that HR is responsive/actively reaches out to ensure that your transition is going well (for example, they have sent everyone 2 gift-baskets in the last 2 months during WFH!) Benefits/pay are also wonderful. Stock discount/401K matching is competitive, and healthcare/dental/vision is very affordable. Tuition reimbursement is also one of the highest in DC, plus the new office is unbelievable. Note to individuals considering JBG Smith: please remember that many of these reviews are from property staff, not from corporate staff. Not to discount property staff's experiences working for JBG Smith, but the corporate work experience is obviously going to be different than the property staff work experience. I almost didn't accept my position because of some of the comments posted on Glassdoor, but a few months in, I'm so glad I accepted my offer.","So far there hasn't been a lot of company social events, but of course, we're in the middle of COVID-19. Supposedly there's an annual booze cruise in October, but I'm guessing that is cancelled due to the pandemic. Either way, it could be nice if the company offered smaller virtual social events to get to know fellow co-workers/individuals in different departments since we aren't returning to the office until Spring. The only real ""con"" is that unlike other major REITS in the DC area (Avalon Bay Communities, etc.), JBG Smith does not offer an employee rent discount on company owned properties (but I can also see why so this isn't a real con and more of a wish). That said, with DC housing prices skyrocketing, I could easily see myself jumping to a REIT that offers such a program in the future if such an opportunity arose (just since rent is so expensive/huge part of any person living in DC's budget)",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

I love working for JBG SMITH,5.0,"Apr 14, 2022","In my experience, JBG is an honest company and my morals align closely with their Core Values. I love that they are actively working to make housing affordable for those in need and they support other groups through JBG Cares. As a Residential employee, I really enjoy working with my direct supervisor and believe they would go to bat for me in just about any situation. I want to perform at a higher level because of them. JBG SMITH put a lot of thought and effort info how they operated through the pandemic. They took a conservative approach to re-opening which was difficult at times, but was ultimately for the health and wellbeing of its employees and customers. JBG paid team members that worked on site ""Hazard Pay"" in relation to COVID for about a year. All JBG employees working at the property level were eligible and we were automatically paid $3.50/hr in addition to their hourly wage. This was almost a 20% raise for many front line employees in a very uncertain time. The benefits package is very solid. JBG contributes 50% of what I contribute toward my 401k -- up to 3%. I feel that my PTO and mental health are prioritized at JBG SMITH. We now have a Cultural Reflection day each year that can be used as an additional personal day with no questions asked. JBG was on top of Juneteenth becoming a Federal Holiday and within hours of the presidential announcement, we were notified that offices would be closed the following Monday in observance of this Holiday. JBG Residential gave site team members two extra personal days to use between 1/1/22 and 2/28/22 citing that the teams working on site had been resilient through the pandemic and they wanted us to take time to mentally prepare for the upcoming season. JBG SMITH sent employees multiple care packages throughout the pandemic with food/snacks, board games, and a notes from the executive team. Matt Kelly (CEO) created weekly videos and sent them to the entire company to talk to us about new things happening at JBG to keep the entire company clued into how things were going. He often encouraged team members to stay healthy and stay home as our health was most important. Health/Dental takes care of practically wherever I want to go (including Georgetown MedStar).

"Toxic environment, poor management, & lack of advancement",1.0,"Dec 19, 2021",The new office & decent benefits (unlimited PTO & good insurance coverage),"I’m surprised by the amount of positive on this company considering the large turnover it has experience over the last couple of years, and the turnover continues even more so recently since the merger. This company loses quality employees because it lacks proper training structures within teams, an actual career path for many employees who are not in either accounting or development (as they are treated much differently than other teams), nepotism, negative/toxic work culture, and lack of work/life balance. The churn and burn from their field employees are even worse than corporate. They’re often left on their own and feel forgotten, unsupported, and less than next to corporate employees. There’s zero room for growth and this company has made it known they will keep their employee base status quo. Their retention strategies are to either offer to transfer an employee or promote them when it is too late. I see reviews that make claims about the positive direction the company is taking on diversity but it STILL severely lacks that across their executive management on down. Most of the executive leadership are there to stay and that makes it hard for others to attain upward movement unless those at the top leave. Not to mention, the executives and senior managers perpetuate the toxic culture, which was carried over from pre-merger. You’re seeing turnover in development, accounting, marketing, and HR. Very concerning to me, but not surprised. The management overseeing these groups are who cultivated and continue to perpetuate the negativity and toxicity. I don’t expect that to change unless they leave. You’ll either be pushed out or reach your breaking point here. It’s not worth it, especially for the below market pay that you’re given for the lack of work life balance. I would be cautious when reading these very vague, scripted positive reviews as it doesn’t reflect the current turn over they’re experiencing. Talk to any employee who is currently at the company and those who have left because you will hear the truth behind what goes on and this company is not headed in a positive, upward direction. Sad since this company has potential but I don’t see it succeeding.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

"Toxic work environment, lack of advancement, poor management",1.0,"Jul 2, 2021",Office space (new) & healthcare benefits,"Extremely toxic work environment where employees are overworked, under appreciated, under paid, and treated poorly by their managers (particularly if you are in accounting and HR). Very much an ‘old boys club’ or ‘frat’ culture, especially in development where employees of this department act entitled, pretentious, and have overinflated egos because of their Ivy League degrees. Other departments have a ‘bully’ culture within their teams, showing favoritism and promoting inappropriate office behavior (I.e. gossip and poor treatment towards their employees). The accounting department has very high turnover, lacking proper management and training of their new employees. HR has had a lot of turnover since the change in their management. HR executives have replaced many long standing employees with their friends or colleagues from Marriott. Hiring and recruiting practices are questionable — a lot of favoritism and nepotism occur and are mostly driven by executives and managers who hire employees as a favor. Discrimination and biased hiring decisions happen often here (I.e. hiring managers give preference to candidates with Ivy League degrees or specific brick & mortar universities versus hiring a candidate based on skills and experience). Executives hire employees in secret and make drastic changes to their staff without notice, which creates distrust amongst their employees and reflects poor recruiting practices. Their recruiting team experienced high turnover and what once was a positive team that cared about their employees, has been replaced with employees who further perpetuate the toxic work culture and don’t seem to know what they’re doing. The company has made slight improvements to their diversity and inclusion when looking at their demographics, but there’s still a lack of female and minority representation at the executive and management level. For non-corporate positions — there is an extremely high turnover rate at the property sites. The company lacks competitive pay and strong work culture that extends to their field employees. This company doesn’t provide you with any advancement or a clear career path. Onboarding and training don’t exist. You will sink or swim. One day you’re ‘in’ the next day you are ‘out’ without warning.
