Job for Office Experience or Looking to Move into Property Management,4.0,"Jan 29, 2024","My internal team is very supportive and kind. There are repetitive everyday tasks, but not every day is the same. Always a new project to work on. You can work at your own pace as long as you can get things done by the deadline. You will learn new things daily, especially about property management and equipment. Pretty chill for a temporary job. I am told there are a lot of opportunities to move up. There are companywide fitness challenges and Chair Yoga on Thursdays to try and build community, as well as holiday dinners with staff.","You do not have access to everyone in the company. There is a chain of command you have to go through in order to get certain things done/answer questions. The company had a merge in 2023, and it has been very chaotic since. Lots of issues with rent statements and general system issues. They will throw things at you last minute and throw all the things property managers don't have time for at you. That's how it is being an admin assistant anywhere though. I don't think the wage is fair for the workload. I was told on interview that 60% of my time will be on the phone, but realistically it's more 25% or less. Majority of my time is spent looking at 3 monitors in an office with little interaction.

First, this company has employees who were there before the merger and they are the only ones who matter. If you are not one of them you will have nothing but problems. Upper management shoot first and ask questions later. They take anything their friends say to be fact and do not ask you directly. You are always having to look over your shoulder. The back stabbing is real here. HR does not care about you so don't think you can go to them, you can't. Their system are as antiquated as I have ever seen. You are literally in 1992 when it comes to the companies procedures. The amount of paperwork is ridiculous and completely unnecessary.
