When I had an issue with a coworker I had no idea what the harassment policy was because I never actually went through the presentation. The admin clicked though it and I signed the paperwork when I was hired. I felt my supervisor considered bullying and abusive behavior to be personality conflicts to be ignored.

Also as a salary employee there are NO LIMITS on the amount of hours I work. My hourly staff are sent home early on many occasions, even when a portion of my team has called out sick.

Step 1. Purchase highly profitable business, come in and pump sunshine up everyones booty about how great Lineage is and how much they are going to improve things. ""YEAH Lineage!!"" Step 2. Bring in senior managers who have zero refrigerated warehousing experience. Sounds sketchy but we'll go with it. These guys worked on Wall Street surely they're smart? Step 3. Have senior managers start to blame everyone else for their surprising inability to manage a refrigerated warehouse effectively and keep the customers happy. Let this situation drag on faaaaar too long. Step 4. Even though the facility is struggling throw a whole new Lean implementation program into the mix. You know just for fun, see what happens. Step 5. Start pushing out all of the long time middle managers of the facility who helped create the profitable structure. You know because they are clearly the problem. ""Get outta here with all your knowledge and ideas that have been proven to work!"" Step 6. Finally realize that huge mistakes were made in hiring such underqualified managers. Also realize that all of the experienced managers have left or been fired. Oops! Fire senior managers. Little bit late but can't cry over spilled milk. Step 7. Totally abandon the Lean initiative and just focus on customer satisfaction. Wait, what's that? You say all of the people who actually knew how to run the facility are gone? How did that happen, lol. Step 8. Do what Lineage does best. Throw money at the problem. I'm talking lot's of money folks. Millions. Out of town support, corporate troubleshooters, visual aids, corporate power meetings, you name it. Step 9. Realize that all of your money cannot buy success and deal with the sad fact that customers responsible for most of your profits just gave you the finger and you now have to lay off over 50% of your workforce. Step 10. Bring in big dog regional managers to give a pep talk. Start pumping that sunshine again. ""Trust us"" they say, lol. Strategize about how you can hide the failures of the largest, most profitable location you had. Maybe buy some more smaller companies? Under no circumstances discuss how and why it all went bad in the matter of 3-4 short years. Step 11. Head back to the brand new shiny corporate office. Maybe catch some waves?

"Committed Supervisors Struggling to Navigate a Challenging, Understaffed Environment",3.0,"Dec 18, 2024","Supportive Supervisors: The immediate leadership at the supervisor level genuinely cares about their teams and tries to do their best with the resources they are given. Opportunities for Growth: If you are proactive about your development, there are opportunities to learn and grow, especially with exposure to different areas of the logistics process. Stable Industry: Lineage Logistics is well-positioned in a growing industry, offering job stability for those looking for long-term employment.","Burnout and Unrealistic Expectations: Staff are often overburdened with tasks and expected to meet unrealistic productivity goals without adequate resources or support. As a result, burnout is common, and employee well-being can sometimes take a backseat to performance metrics. Toxic Work Environment: A lack of collaboration between management levels sometimes leads to a toxic atmosphere. Managers avoid addressing underlying issues to prevent conflict with others, which causes frustration and disengagement among staff. There seems to be little accountability at higher levels for the struggles faced by employees on the ground. Limited Support for Teams: While supervisors often try to advocate for their teams, they are frequently overruled by upper management, making it difficult for them to effect meaningful change. This creates a disconnect between staff and leadership and leaves supervisors in a difficult position of looking like the ones failing their teams, even when they are powerless to make necessary changes.","Lineage, Inc.",LINE,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lineage-Reviews-E807889.htm

Pay Discrepancy: Compensation is below market rate, yet the expectations for employees are high, often requiring them to pick up the slack due to lack of adequate staffing. Misogynistic Culture: There is a noticeable level of misogyny within this male-dominated environment. Women may find it difficult to navigate a culture where promotions and opportunities often depend more on personal connections than on merit or performance. Ethical Concerns: The company’s ethical standards are questionable, with a focus on delivering results regardless of quality or accuracy. Employee groups have been formed, but these efforts do little to address the deeply rooted cultural issues that stem from the leadership.

Fix it,3.0,"Feb 18, 2024","One of the reasons I work at lineage is because the shift patterns are some of the best I've worked, I get plenty of time off work so I'm not constantly stressed with work. The job itself is not bad at all, it takes a good while to get to a good level with it but once your comfortable it's a doddle. I quite enjoy working with my colleagues on shift since we crack on with the job and we have a good laugh with each other whilst we do it, supervisors and the manager are all good fun to work for and don't belittle you like a lot of higher-ups do in a lot of places, they treat you fairly and respectfully.","There's quite a bit of frustration with three things for me which is communication, mhe and ppe. I feel that things aren't always communicated very well which can get very frustrating since I may be unaware of for instance a change to how we book in stock for a certain customer. My second issue is with the general quality and lack of care when it comes to mhe, the amount of truck's that are not running properly or aren't running at all is frankly ridiculous, I believe all this could be less of an issue if equipment was regularly serviced to reduce chances of them breaking down, I understand sometimes equipment breaks down but it does become rather problematic when multiple trucks are non functional. My third issue is that the ppe quality leaves a lot to be desired in particular the gloves that are provided, they need to provide better quality gloves particularly for people that work in the freezer, your can't last very long in the store with gloves that don't provide enough protection for the cold conditions as such this needs to be addressed.","Lineage, Inc.",LINE,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lineage-Reviews-E807889.htm

Disappointing working experience,1.0,"Mar 28, 2023",Ability to work from home.,"I had a very disappointing working experience with Lineage Logistics Ltd in the Finance Team (I purposely mentioned the team as there are other divisions at their Whakatu premises, NZ). From the start, there were false promises by the manager and a lack of constructive positive communication within the team. The two colleagues were very unfriendly, rude and verbally abusive. There was very poor training in spite of the high volume of data to be processed, and the diversity of activities and conditions. While the Billing and Contract position is a simple job it must be done correctly in order not to overcharge/undercharge the customers whose accounts deal with huge numbers with different conditions/rates in their contracts. Also, the weekly and monthly deadlines must be met with proper performance. There were lots of hours of unpaid overtime done, and not even positive appreciation from the team for such a sacrifice on my part. But, in fact, it was the constant displeasure by them which aggravated the stress and put me down, instead of speedy settlement into the job position. The role has a high turnover rating within a short time period which highlights that something is wrong there. And, I believe, there is poor management that leads to an unprofessional environment and poor culture of the organisation.","Lineage, Inc.",LINE,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lineage-Reviews-E807889.htm

Thankfully there are a few who are trustworthy and do not take time off because the weather is nice of they have had an argument with their girlfriends, brothers, sister-in-law about how many drugs it is actually acceptable to take before going to work and putting their 'so called friends' safety at risk. The second issue is the 'Americanisms' where once a year there is a survey which enables everyone to slate everyone else, wouldn't mind so much but the majority cannot even spell which goes to show the mentality of both the company and a lot of the staff now employed there.","Lineage, Inc.",LINE,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lineage-Reviews-E807889.htm

AC is perhaps the most insensitive and least empathetic person you could put in the HR Manager position, she does not care about staff wellbeing in the slightest and is cliquey with certain people which makes her biased with certain things. Some staff get away with everything because they have family and friends in management. Expected to sit and take verbal abuse because ""that's what we are paid for"" Too much work, too few staff to do it. One manager will ask you to prioritise something, another will then come along and question why you're doing it so you'll explain, original manager well then do the usual ""no I didn't say to do that"" Guess who's the one that gets it in the neck then for doing nothing wrong... A lot of managers can't do any of the jobs their staff do and have the cheek to say it's ""easy"" Or question why it's taking so long. Staff bullied into doing overtime constantly because the company won't hire another body. Lineage talk a big talk but can't walk the walk. The UK management chain are corrupt and need shaking up, some of them forget it isn't Yearsley anymore and are still stuck in their old ways. 100 good deads go unnoticed, 1 bad thing and people are down your throat.
