They pay for really good applications - but you're measured by each of these investments and are expected to use every single one of them. The problem is, the apps don't work together cohesively and you spend a lot of time managing the aps for reporting to the higher-ups.. and less time in front of clients. The inventory system is old and doesn't provide a good presentation for what is available to clients. You will spend a lot of time making it easier for clients to view your offerings - but every office presents differently. For salespeople, the pay structure is extremely confusing. Sales people are motiviated by money - and it's not clear how to work the system for a higher pay each year. You could be billing more money year over year and making less if you don't make the budget assigned and don't qualify for bonuses that are announced late in the quarter. the goal posts are constantly moving.",OUTFRONT Media Inc.,OUT,Specialty,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Outfront-Media-Reviews-E930001.htm

Only if you’re desperate for a job come here.,1.0,"Jan 23, 2024","The people are nice, and the pay is good. That’s really it.","So just a side note that is review only pertains to the Berkeley office. Other Outfront offices do things differently, so I can’t say anything about them. Unfortunately the general manager to this location isn’t that great. He’s a nice guy, however he’s very unpredictable and unprepared. He doesn’t have a good plan for new hires, and expects them to know everything on their first week. He also shuffles his employees around to several other people, and they’re not given a heads up from the GM on how to help them. He’s also not transparent, and will leave out a lot of important details during the job interviews. He also doesn’t allow some employees to do their jobs, and will do it himself instead of giving them a chance. The office itself is also not ready and still under construction. The GM doesn’t really care that the noise and debris is bothering some employees and expects them to still show up to work, even under uncomfortable circumstances. The ceilings and walls keep leaking from the rains, and it’s uncomfortable for some employees to work with. The building also isn’t really up to code, and it looks like they cut some corners. For example, if you have a disability you won’t be able to work upstairs with everyone else because there’s no elevator. You’ll have to stay downstairs where it’s freezing cold, and not handicap accessible. IT takes forever to assist you to help, and the laptops are kind of out date. Bonuses are hardly given out, and there’s really no perks offered. Quite a bit of turnover here, as well. And the benefits are super expensive. The company may pay a lot, but they also take a lot from your paychecks.

Unprofessional and hostile work environment,1.0,"Aug 3, 2023",Competitive salary and decent benefits.,"I worked at OUTFRONT for three months. I wanted to share my experiences working for this company to help inform others considering working here. I was discharged from my cybersecurity position after just over three months of employment. I was given a performance review where I was given a plan to improve my performance. Then, less than a week later, I was terminated on the spot with no warning. My manager asked me for a quick ""chat."" When I joined the call, he told me someone else was joining, which I hadn't been informed of prior to the call. Then an HR representative joined the call and immediately told me I was being terminated. When they were about to end the call, I asked if I could give my input. They told me they don't usually allow employees being terminated to speak up, but I did anyway. I told them that it was unethical what they were doing and told them how I felt about my experiences. I then left the call. In my experience at OUTFRONT, I felt the work environment was unprofessional and hostile. My manager would regularly adopt a combative stance against everyone on calls and emails, he would regularly raise his voice and swear at us, say belittling comments to me about my work (e.g. criticize me for not rolling out a simulated phishing awareness campaign on time, despite him shelving the task for two years), and almost never gave any praise to anyone for their accomplishments. In my performance review, he criticized me for my self assessment in which I said I try hard to create an inclusive environment for all races, genders, religions, and creeds. However, he himself had not hired anyone except for white men. Out of the whole team of 15 or so people, we had 1 woman and fewer than 5 non-white employees. Despite claiming he had tried to create an inclusive environment, his team was composed overwhelmingly of white men. As a new employee fairly new in my career, I was given no chance whatsoever to improve my performance and grow in my career. I had never received any written or verbal warnings or detected any signs of disapproval from management for my performance. After my one and only performance review, I was falsely led to believe I would have tome to improve my performance. I felt I was in a cutthroat environment in which the communication between managers and engineers was lacking, good work was not praised, and every mistake was harshly criticized. I do not recommend working in this company to anyone. I was terminated right on the spot with no other job lined up and given no time whatsoever to improve my performance. I had no salary, no health benefits, and it took me months to find a new job to be able to support myself. It was an extremely upsetting and stressful experience for me and I an thankful I found a professional and respectful work environment afterwards.",OUTFRONT Media Inc.,OUT,Specialty,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Outfront-Media-Reviews-E930001.htm

Management has absolutely zero interest in technology - even though they sure pretend to in pitch meetings to clients. Meanwhile, the inventory tracking system runs on a platform from the 80s. You literally open up to a black screen with a blinking neon green cursor. I feel like I might as well be in an SNL sketch. When I left at the end of 2019, they still did not even have Salesforce ... they said they were just about to launch it when I started in 2016. When the possibility of actually moving the company into the 21st century is raised to management there is a lot of push back from high level sales people who just feel more comfortable selling the same billboard the same way they've been selling it for the past 15 years.

I could really go on a rant here, but I’ll be brief. If you want to be in sales, there’s no training, so good luck. If you want a career path, it won’t happen unless you’re in sales and can network with the right guys. If you’re in anything other than a sales role, there’s no training and no opportunity for growth.

You'll make some mistakes having to learn the products on your own, but most won't be fatal.
