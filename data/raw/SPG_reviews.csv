They're the single highest reason for turnover. They micromanage. It's the same situation from Office Space, where you've got five bosses. They like to pretend they're like 911 or alike, but they are far from it. They like to take pride in being ""the only thing like this,"" but they're too self-obsessed to understand how the world works. They will and do discriminate against anything that isn't a warm body in a chair staring at two monitors watching cameras. They preach ""proactive"" searches on equipment that's as reliable as a Chevy Nova. Be prepared to sign an NDA. Everything you see is ""Company Sensitive,"" but it isn't Top Secret. There are often tours for emergency personnel, other Simon property groups, and anyone else they want to sell the services to.

job security and good benefits if you can put up with the rest,2.0,"Mar 29, 2025","Job security in this industry is surprisingly decent if you are happy to work the same position forever. Health insurance was actually above average in my experience and the company contributed to HSAs. Decent 401k match. 10 days of PTO and 5 “floating” days standard yearly. But if you ask nicely in the hiring process, they may grant you an extra 5 days. You get an extra # of days every few years.","Let me just say this reflects my experience as a former employee but does not necessarily reflect the current experience or that of every department. 1. Messy… Everyone was always stressed out and anxious, which evidently trickled down from the top. I saw seemingly very little strategy behind all the busy work which then produced little to no results. Fire drills constantly. You were expected to be “on call” 24/7. No one was interested in updating strategy to avoid falling behind competitors/trends as long as sr mgmt got their bonuses. if you made a small mistake on something you were trained on for 5 mins, you’d be chewed out and treated as if you just demolished the entire business. Was toxic at times. 2. Personalities were a whole other issue - felt very high school or reality TV at times and cliquey. Heard my fair share of inappropriate, sometimes racist, and body/appearance-shaming comments. Lots of gossip and things that should have been handled between the person and their manager in a private and professional manner. Some people did not know how to have hard conversations with the people they worked with and instead it turned into petty drama. Since it’s actually surprisingly hard to fire permanent employees at this company they will bully you until you quit. If you’re a contractor they will just fire you the same day. Neither of these were my own experience but behaviors I witnessed several times. 3. Raises and salaries were and are still not competitive with reality. My job title changed significantly but not on paper and mgmt or HR would not initiate an official title change or salary adjustment. No opportunity for growth until someone leaves, and even then you may be blocked from applying for an internal position. Whatever technology they use to determine salaries is stuck in 1990. Raises are capped at 2% and the bonuses negligible, even before taxes. the amount of work you will end up doing is worth double the pay for very little reward or recognition. During Covid, raises were capped at 1% and was not made up for the following year, while upper management that took pay “cuts” got it all back in retro pay. Either way, each “raise” you actually take a significant pay cut due to inflation.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

My Opinion but Your Choice,2.0,"May 27, 2023","(Field work pov) You get to meet a lot of different people on your team and your customers. Depending on you or your team, tough days can easily roll off your shoulders with ease with the help of each other. Treat you customer with compassion (regardless of the situation) and you can make the most heated customer your best friend. Don't be shy to say hi! People can be very kind. The better you get to know the people you work with, the easier work becomes. As long as you are given respect and time to be trained, then you can easily grow quickly in the company. You'll learn a of new skill that you can apply in the future. Also , great way to connect on the business side of life. Lot of fun events. Make a lot of good friends. Forgive me, there are probably more pros, however I seem to be having an issues balancing them out with the cons.... That however, could be due to my own relationship with my job positions, and other experiences here.","(Field work pov)They expect you to do more than humanly possible. A lot of jobs positions have been discontinued through out the years in a blink of an eye. This puts a lot more stress and problems on the ones that remain. Plenty of employees have been pushed to take care of other properties and their own. Now a lot of positions require you to do ""hybrid"" jobs. Not the kind that you come to work or stay home, hybrid. But the kind where you're stuck doing four job positions in one. Delegated right with a respectable team and your time, it could be possible to make it through. However, I would not doubt your mental and physical health rapidly decline due to the amount of stess. Always watch the ones who gossip. Especially, if they are senior workers that are know around the company. If you're a new employee and they don't like you, you might as well quit. They will not let you get ahead for a second. No matter how good you are. They'll take away any confidence you had in yourself. It is not below them to bully you into quitting or pushing others to fire you. They will pull any excuses to do so. I mean ANY. Because they worked there for so long, the company/team will let them get away with it. Unless, you have a strong / fair higher-up and supportive team that'll stop it beforeit gets worse. It's like highschool all over again, folks. When in a toxic environment, if your boss hasn't confronted you about a situation at work, and they write you up for the smallest things, leave! Most likely the are trying to fire you anyways, and they won't stop until you are gone. Oh, and they will tell your teammates of your work/personal unfortunate circumstances and then some. You'll know when you're not welcomed anymore. Even if they smile at you. Especially, if they leave their work space to go whisper something to another, and you're the only one else in the area. It could be their own personal issue. However, if you are experiencing anything from above, I wouldn't count on it. (Also, lower rank positions get pick on just as much. Doesn't matter how long they've been there.) As much as I hate to say it, depending on the location, the teams can be extremely toxic. So please be careful of your mental health. It can and will effect your physical health over time if not taken care of. Burn out is real, and some choose to ignore the signs of their employees. Just assume they already don't trust you, and get a doctor's note. Better safe that sorry. Because of everyone being so overwhelmed with their jobs already, you are not likely to get proper amount of training, and you'll need it. If, however, you have been in the same position and just need side notes than you'll probably be fine. Keep in mind, a lot of changes are happening, so you might not know the same programs. Good luck finding someone who does or has the time. I won't even discuss pay. Just keep in mind the work and time you put in. Oh and take your lunch away from work. Give yourself that mental break. You're going to need it. If you want a challenge, this is it. If you have a good team, in good health, mental ""normal"", multi tasker, works well under pressure, open minded to change, handle unhealthy amount of stress, confident, and ok with the possibility of your position being cut, then go right ahead. But that all depends on what you pursue, and the people you work around. Sometimes it doesn't matter how longer you work here. It could also be how far down the latter you are in the company.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

"Tenant Coordination - Do not expect this to be a positive career move, you will get no respect from upper management.",2.0,"Oct 1, 2014",Good salary at time of hire.,"Din't let the good salary entice you to take a position in Tenant Coordination. They lure you in with a good salary and give you time to increase your standard of living. Once they think you can't afford to quit (they do pay on the upper end of the scale and it makes leaving difficult), they will begin to tell you how terrible your work is, degrade you and try to reduce your self esteem (another tactic to keep you from leaving). You will ultimately feel trapped and hopeless. At that point, upper management can then get their jollies kicking you around. Think I'm joking??? Salary growth stalls almost immediately but you won't find that out until your first performance review. No matter how much you excel and contribute to the success of the department. T.C. Executives have favorite employees who benefit economically from the entire team's effort. If you are not one of those favorites, despite how much you excel and contribute, you will get little to no bonus or salary increase, not even basic cost of living while others who are favorites will get showered with rewards and accolades. Beware: Tenant Coordination Executives practice corporate bullying and encourage their management staff to do the same... and they do. Tenant Coordinators do not coordinate tenants, they are upper management's crash test dummies. Upper management will do their best to make you crash and then call you a dummy. Remember, HR is a department that exists to protect the company, not the employees. HR will make that very apparent, if you ever go to them with an issue.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

Trying to hire qualified people for the job they expect is difficult because they do not want to pay for the talent that is truly required. People I interviewed laughed at me when I told them the salary I could offer for positions that I need to fill. Upper leadership is only concerned with themselves and their bonuses and they will make you suffer to make sure they get their money (malls and centers would go without key leadership positions to ""save money"" and to get their bonus, while the leaders at the mall, busted their backs to keep the places running, picking up the slack for the unfilled position). Recognition is almost non-existent. They will also cut corners anywhere and everywhere they can. As a business, I understand that you need to make money. But when your property is making over $100,000 more than budget, they still want you to cut back--again because they need to make sure they are getting their $$. Oh and be ready to be at their beckoned call at all times. Day off, plans---nope, if they need something from you, it's right now---drop everything!

Corporate constantly starting ""new initiatives"" and constantly pushing new implementation for the LOCAL Team to execute. Work overload is unbearable, and always more work being pushed on. Constant fear of making mistakes, the Simon culture is very cut throat. You are basically at the mercy of your managers if you are well liked you get to move up, even if you are clueless at your job. Issues are constantly pushed under the rug and if you think for a second you can rely on HR to assist in mediating or taking action to fix major ethic issues you are absolutely wrong. The most that will happen is the person you called about will know it was actually you who made the call... awkward much?

Old School,2.0,"Jan 23, 2021",Working for a Fortune 500 company could be a good stepping stone. The benefits are ok.,"It’s seems as though being rude to each other is encouraged. Their processes are antiquated because they don’t want to spend any money. Before the pandemic, my boss had never once taken me or the team to lunch. Not even on my first day. Since the pandemic, HR hasn’t communicated at all except for a couple emails that detailed the offices cleaning procedures and the temperature taking process so that you come to work. If you don’t come to work, you are shamed. Everyone is in constant fear of loosing their jobs so they come to work sick anyways. All the departments are completely siloed having no idea that the other department re-enters all the same data into another system. They still print everything and have giant broken Excel spreadsheets with very few people who even understand them. They don’t care about their employees at all. Raises are barely cost of living if you are lucky. They didn’t even try to have a virtual Christmas party instead they emailed at the end of the day before Christmas Eve to tell everyone they could take Christmas Eve off knowing that most people had either already used that day as a vacation day or didn’t prepare to take the day so they still had to come to work anyways. But still the nicest thing they have done since I’ve been there. David Simon has never physically addressed the company since I’ve been there. I’ve never seen the man. Not even virtually. He sends an email after earnings calls, that’s it.

Run away as fast as you can!,2.0,"Mar 29, 2021",Good Benefits Comparable Market Pay Very good at recognizing personal time - not many after-hours calls or emails,"SO MANY! Training - there is absolutely no on-boarding or training. If you haven’t done this job at a competitor previously, you are screwed because one half-day of “training” will get you nowhere. I.T. - Unless things have changed recently, they were still using LotusNotes as of last year. LotusNotes!! Not to mention, we were salespeople that were expected to be on the road, but they were not inclined to give their talent laptops. You couldn’t have a meeting off-site and pull up a lease plan, LOD, etc. It was a “security” concern. Management - What can you say about a company that laid off and furloughed thousands of people only two weeks into the Pandemic while continuing to save old retail business models to ensure their malls appeared “full”? Nothing. It’s a horrible example of corporate motivation. Mom & Pops and millions of small businesses across the country, were fighting to keep their staff on-board during this horrible time - yet, the real estate company with the best balance sheet of record, did not hesitate to show thousands of people the door only TWO WEEKS IN! That tells you all you need to know. Ruthless. All about the money. So many people that had worked for them for 15-25 years, were axed at the very first moment of a worldwide crises. Culture - No gatherings, no team outings. There was not one company-wide conference call - not even during the mall shutdowns to address rumors and/or worries. There was no team-building. Bottom line - If you need a job and want to make decent money and like working alone, knowing they will get rid of you in a heartbeat - then this is your place. Otherwise, run away as fast as you can.

"Large Company, Lots of Layers",1.0,"Jun 13, 2016","Good salary, pretty good health benefits. Good 401k matching perks after minimal time of employment. If you are willing to relocate to move up, there are options because of the quantity of centers owned. Daily work life at the center level is decent if you have a good GM that serves as a filter.","Long holiday/weekend hours for all center management staff plus you're ""on call"" 24/7, hard to juggle this with a young family. Too many layers of management and you have to get approvals on almost every little thing even though center mgt. is said to be empowered. Very heavy administrative load - the amount of paperwork and approvals necessary to do anything is ridiculous and inefficient. A few personalities above me were more concerned about their bottom line (read: bonus) than the well being of the center. I was not involved in the decision-making of hiring other managers at my own center but rather was just told her the choice was being put into place. When I needed help while short-staffed, those in the regional positions to do this hiring purposely stalled on interviewing and getting someone in place. At the same time, another regional was slow to respond to requests for help and when he did, the response I got was ""the expectation is that you will just handle things until...."" Too much paperwork for bidding, paying invoices, leases, pretty much anything you want to do. Constant pounding to cut costs even to the detriment of customer amenities (while pushing us to increase customer amenities - with no dedicated budget). Daily requests and emails to fill out corporate spreadsheets, surveys, reports, etc. We received so many that we got additional email reminders with due dates just so we could keep them straight. All of this took away from actually managing the center. So many policies and procedures that's it's difficult to hire qualified individuals and train them on everything because it's so overcomplicated. Marketing programs are sent to the centers to be executed, so there is very little creativity for mktg. directors onsite other than to sell, sell, sell and make more for the bottom line. They have too many cooks in the kitchen to be effective (ie: too many bosses giving them directions). Basically, the management job was overall just very frustrating. After being in management and serving as a filter for all the directives coming down to us from all directions at the regional and corporate levels, it just because exhausting. ""The Funnel Effect"" is what one staffer called it - everything above just needs one little thing but by the time those ""one little things"" funnel down to the center, it's a million little things we have to react to (surveys, spreadsheets, databases, etc.) and usually nothing comes of them.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

If you want a work-life balance don't work here.,1.0,"Nov 9, 2015","It is a large company and provides the opportunity to work pretty much anywhere in the country you want. There are some gems that work for Simon, especially in the Southwest. If you are interested in property management or retail this is a great place to build experience and contacts.","Simon does not care about their employees. This is reflected in a number of ways. One, there is minimal training programs in place to effectively equip employees to be successful in their respective roles. On this point I will give them some credit as they are starting to ramp up efforts in this area but they are sorely behind given their size and continued growth. It's typically a ""throw you into the deep end"" scenario and if you don't make it, tough, they'll find someone else who will. This sends an immediate message that you are not valued as they won't even take the time to make sure you have what you need to do the job. Two, there is no company support of a decent work life balance. Retail in it's very nature can be very demanding, especially during the holiday season. The message that gets to the field employees is typically get it done no matter the cost or get fired. I've seen tenured employees with many successes in previous years get fired or seriously demoted after one significant failure. Again, reinforcing the feeling that you are not valued as an employee and if you aren't perfect, don't apply. Three, the culture is very political and can get really nasty. If you're not is with the right people you can kiss your career opportunities goodbye. If you don't like playing theses games this company is not for you. At the end of the day, culture trickles down from the top. By all accounts and some personal experience the home office is a hot mess and top executives are some of the greediest, nastiest, self-important people out there. Unless attitudes change at the top, nothing will change throughout the company. All that is valued is making money at whatever cost and taking care of employees that work hard to make that happen is not a priority. Four, the company doesn't pay well (so more money will hit their bottom line). If your role exists in another industry, go there. Simon pays very low rates and expects crazy hours in the field. Overall I had a very poor experience with Simon and would not recommend this. There are plenty of companies out there that have found a way to be successful and take care of their employees.

Working for Simon Property Group is for you, if you like getting underpaid, emotionally-exhausted, and undervalued.","This is literally the worst job I've ever had. You're underpaid for an ridiculous amount of work and there's no such thing as a ""team-culture."" Credit is never due to the person who actually does the work and also, your regional marketing/sales staff will quickly take credit for your hard work. As soon as relationships are built and $$$ is negotiated, someone ""higher"" than you will want to take credit for their bonuses. There were countless times, I've seen this happen to my direct reports. Absolutely ridiculous. Field employees (Employees working at the mall themselves) are literally treated like dirt-- at no point are the field employee's ""thanked"" for their hard work. Not even a generic Christmas e-card, cheap giveaway, nothing. Vacations are ""frozen"" during November and December and you're expected to work weekends at least once a month. Asking to take vacations are always a hassle and an inconvenience to your direct reports. Bonus? If you're paid hourly, you won't get one. Paid Salary?

The work environment is toxic, there is no room for improvement. Ceilings everywhere. There are people working in this company for 30 years, they won't change. And the company reacts stupidly to everything. Instead of leading the industry, they follow trends for 2 minutes. The first sign of trouble in COVID, they laid off the Development department followed by furloughing everyone from the Marketing team.

Then HR, not helpful. HR matters are never properly addressed. There are no follow-ups. They launch an investigation but don't actually do anything. No one cares about you, if you have great ideas, your GMs will take credit and never give you due credit. They are all about looking good to Denise, the RVP. Denise on the other hand bullies her GMs. She yells and screams at them. I feel for all the GMs. That woman is nasty, emotional and needs HR to address things but HR, how dare they touch an RVP. It becomes about we have to work as a team and how Denise is producing numbers. All Denise does is keep people on the tightest leash. There are no commissions for the team.

In addition, nepotism is rampant with children/cousins of top management in positions they would never get on their own skills. The ""Field""(malls) tries to do the best, but this is where the company cuts back. So rather than cut fat at the Corporate level, the people in the Field are expected to carry out plans made by Corporate (who have never worked in the Field) with minimal staff. People are working 12 hours a day usually 6 days a week. You're always catching up with no time to really plan ahead. People who are handling a lot of money in Guest Services and are the first people customers meet are paid just above minimum wage. That's just wrong and inviting problems.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm
Office Administrator,1.0,"Aug 14, 2018",Close to home and local shopping (other than the property itself),"The culture and mentality of this company is well known. They are management heavy, and will make scape goats out of the hourly employees. While the Office Administrator works ""with"" management, they are not management. While they support the managers, they are not privy to the bonuses and perks management gets, yet without the support of the OA, there would be no bonuses. Employee beware. Expectations are high and unrealistic; rewards and recognition minimal. Everyone is out for themselves and will throw you under the bus should it suit them. Beware of the moles - no one is your friend so watch your back.

The Most Cut-Throat Environment Ever,1.0,"May 14, 2014","Insurance Benefits, Bonus, nothing else","Cut-Throat Environment, Bad-Management, Poor Work-Life Balance, Must work on Holidays and Weekends, Low Pay, No Room for Growth, Management only cares about their bonuses. My Manager had no regard for my personal life as she would call me on my days off and expect me to be readily available at all times. Even on days when I would call out sick, she would text and call. I would have to work up to 60 hours per week and only get paid for 40 hours. The company expects you to work a minimum of 50+ hours and only pay you for 40 hours. The majority of Managers micro-manage as this is part of the company culture. The company ""Simonizes"" its staff into robots who are constantly available who must show up to work even during inclement weather, like blizzards and hurricanes. They expect you to multi-task at the speed of light or you are not efficient enough. Must work long, hard hours on weekends and especially Holidays. I became physically and mentally burned out along with some of my colleagues. There were times when I had no coverage to even use the restroom. I observed racist and elitist comments and attitudes toward minorities and disabled employees. Corporate Office would send email updates and implement new programs every day and require you to get accustomed to the ever-changing environment. Employees walk around the office looking like slobs with no makeup on or business attire due to the high stress the company puts them through. Most employees who remain become brainwashed into company culture and like vultures wait for their turn to move to the next position. One cannot even eat lunch in peace because there was always something that needed to be done at that precise moment. Most Guest Services Mangers do not last a year and when they do, it is because these people have families and must keep their jobs and cannot afford to lose their benefits. This position is not highly respected. If you are a GSM you are basically everyone's doormat and they expect you to accept this as normal. The Corporate Office is also very disorganized in terms of program implementation and realistic expectations. Minimal resources are allocated and yet one must make miracles. Simon Property Group is the absolute worst company I have ever worked for and would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm
Unrealistic Expectations in an Unprofessional Environment,1.0,"Feb 9, 2018","-Benefits were decent, 401k match was good. -The handful of genuine people I built relationships with along the way and a select few people will try and help you to succeed. -Ability to move up if you are willing to work hard ( it worked for me)","I worked at multiple properties and carried multiple positions during my employment. Each one got worse and worse- however the underlying issues are all the same. Lack of competency and caring from field level management and lack of concern from VPs makes it a very frustrating environment. Veteran employees point fingers while the people underneath them are worked to death for a fraction of the pay and essentially no training. It is routine to leave crucial positions open for months in order to save money, but managers wont step up to absorb any of the additional responsibilities. It all boils down to the bottom line and the managers bonuses. At my last mall- my direct supervisor was immature, inappropriate and the way i was treated eventually became intolerable and borderline abusive. The majority of my departments workload fell on my shoulders and I was expected to be available to work no matter what day or time to get it all done. There were times I worked 7 days a week and wasn’t allowed to take comp time or it would be promised and revoked. I was told I couldn’t take vacation days that had been approved 6 months in advance for no reason and was routinely guilted into working nights and weekends at the last minute. Having prior commitments was unacceptable- if I was unable to be available at the drop of a hat I was told ""this is not the job for you."" I was yelled by my manager in front of another co-worker during an event and was never given an apology. When I addressed it directly I was told if you're upset about it then you clearly cant handle it and ""this is not the job for you."" Addressing issues with your HR wasn’t an option as the only outcome will be a target on your back. They are not there for the protection of employees, they are there to defend management- issues are buried and nothing remains confidential. Higher ups knew what was happening and allowed it continue because after so many years this became the norm. I eventually became burned out and quit due to the unrealistic expectations. The lack of concern from anyone above me was disheartening. The expectations of many positions were unrealistic - not just mine. They push you until you crack, then treat you as if you are weak. The unprofessional culture was often perpetuated by management. Some VPs are aware of unacceptable behaviors going on and instead of addressing them- they talk about them among mall teams- almost deeming them acceptable as they became a running joke. Certain VPs were the number one source of gossip. They were the first to blame you for things your supervisor was responsible for and we’re just blatantly disrespectful. When i finally quit it was hardly acknowledged by anyone except the VP who essentially said she’d do me a favor and let me stay.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

"Lazy,",1.0,"Feb 13, 2018","I worked with Simon at a mall in the Northeast/New England region for over 2 and a half years. Throughout my time, I learned a lot (with very minimal training, and no, reading the policies do not teach you how to do your job) but also met some great people that made working there tolerable. Two favorable things from the company: 401K matching and time off was generous.","I was overworked and underpaid (yes, that typically does happen in lower level jobs), but, it got to a point where I was doing the guest services manager and marketing directors jobs as an administrator because said director had no interest in learning what the role entailed, and quite possibly, was incapable of actually being able to do the job they were hired for. The staff of this mall was very lazy and often pointed fingers and a handful of people to do the work for them. When anything got messy, these same individuals stepped back and would let others take the blame, even if it wasn't their fault. The lack of respect from upper level management, including property managers and regional level vice presidents was borderline non-existent. As an administrator, the only time you were acknowledged was when something needed to be done immediately, but the person responsible was unable to do it, most likely because they were unfit for their position and did not make any effort to learn how to do what was needed. There is room for growth, but as many others say, unless you want to move across the country, you will not go far. There were multiple opportunities where you'd apply for an internal position in your region, and would often be overlooked because someone in the regional group that is interviewing you doesn't like you.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm

"The ""Simon Smile"", the Dark Triad and Incentivized Failure",1.0,"Jun 17, 2019",-Pays decent and on time,"-Mediocre management staff have ruined any of Simon's efforts to maintain acceptable quality and safety standards. -Dark triad personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) run rampant. Simon's corporate culture is one of the most toxic I've ever seen. You'll find more maturity in a high school. This almost certainly impacts Simon's financial forecasts in a negative fashion. -Failure is incentivized via a brain dead bonus structure. Rather than doing a job right, Simon seems to direct its managers toward doing things as cheaply as possible. This leads to the agonizing problem of things costing more in the long run because problems are kicked down the road so the bosses can pocket a bigger bonus at Christmas. Then next year when everything falls apart, management can simply make it a capital project and skirt any loss of bonus payouts. -Serious health and safety concerns. Because staff aren't allowed to do their jobs properly, Simon has allowed all sorts of problems to lurk just beyond the veil. This is the most troubling thing about Simon's arrival at my former place of work. There is such a laser focus on saving every single penny that good work is often undermined or put on hold indefinitely for sums of less than fifty dollars. Employees are still expected to make the equipment work or find dubious workarounds to maintain functionality. -Workers are asked to do personal work for bosses (at their own homes) while on the clock in direct violation of company policy.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm
Guest Service Rep,1.0,"Sep 17, 2014",I like being alone sometimes,"Where do I begin? There are no benefits. None at all. they consider 30 hours a week full time. I used to work at least that much and I did not receive any full time benefits. I come in on my days off to work because my manager harasses me and calls multiple times until I am forced to answer. I never get to enjoy my days off. I always come in when they need me to but when my car broke down and I was unable to make my shift, I still got in trouble for not coming in to work. I informed her the night that it happened. So, on top of my only mode of transportation breaking down, I had my boss calling me four different times making the situation more stressful. They harass all of us. I do not like the management at all. There is a tremendous lack of communication and only the reps take the fall for it because we deal with customers first hand. We are never informed of any changes that go on until we are being reprimanded for doing what we thought was going on. There is hardly ever a manager there, they are off every weekend. This is completely ridiculous because we are a brand new shopping center and we have new people that did not get proper training. I did not have a proper training and I have been here for three months now. They expect us to know information that they do not tell us until it is too late. My manager messed up in a big way because she didn't provide us with paperwork we needed which can lead to the termination of my coworker. I had him there as a witness to show that the paperwork was not there, she came in before him the next morning, printed out the paperwork, put it in the binder and told him it was there the whole time and that I just didn't see it, which was not true. We cannot trust the management. My manager does not even know the terms of out mall gift cards. She doesn't really talk to us, she leaves sticky notes everywhere and expects her job to be done that way. There is no face-to-face communication. I feel that leaving notes everywhere insults our intelligence, if you are a manager, you need to communicate information to your staff professionally, not like children. There is even a lack of communication between management. Our general manager doesn't ever know what is happening with the booth. I think that they have given the guest service manager too much power.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm
Stay away please. There are better opportunities elsewhere,1.0,"Oct 28, 2022","The field workers are some of the nicest and most caring people I've worked with. You really build a strong bond because we all have to go through the corporate BS of not spending money, but things are never good enough.","Corporate it too thickheaded to see the changes taking place in the world. How they ran this company years ago is how they continue to run it (behind the scenes stuff). Specifically for marketing, and as of recent, it's a constant revolving door. Marketing Directors who've have been here for years are leaving out of nowhere. This review alone shoud be enough of a reason to not work here. When your most loyal field team members just leave at 10+ years. It says something. Corporate visits are fun. They give you no budget and tell you to make everything better with no money. Sorry that's not how the world works. Holidays are no longer enjoyable. You are working at the highest level of kissing a**. Remember your first retail job as a teenager. Now imagine it in a ""professional"" environment. Specifically for my property, employee satisfaction was always at an all time low. Retail is such a small niche and once you get in its so hard to get out because it literally can't be applied anywhere. If you're in retail, knowing people is your best way out. I know who employees who have literally told me they are still here because they're stuck. In the beginning I thought what they offered was the normal work/life balance. Now that I'm out working for a legitimate organization. I can confidently say that Simon has NO work/life balance. None what so ever. Corporate is not transparent with the field teams. The messages they give don't align with what is being seen on the field team side. Corporate will claim they are seeing record numbers and beating last year's numbers however on the field side you see retailers struggling with filling positions, struggling with sales, and overall satisfaction with Simon as a landlord is awful. Essentially Simon is the bully in these situations. You either work with Simon, hate your life, and maybe your store with last or you take a chance with a free-standing store. Honestly from what I've seen, take your chance. Corporate is always off on holiday weeks. Yes week. Not day. It will be Christmas week. You're trying to meet a deadline because the corporate office loves ""quick turnaround"" projects because we aren't busy enough and you can't get a hold of anyone. NO ONE from the corporate office will respond. They just all disappear. and this is any holiday, not just the big ones. Simon is known for underpaying their employees the field average. You work for this giant organization however your friend who's in the same field whose working with a growing startup is getting paid more. Your essentially working here for job security (who knows if that's still true. I've seen people fired and the new person starts with 20k less than the previous person) and benefits. Honestly there's so much more but you're seeing the trend here.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm
"If you don't like how things are run, find another job.",1.0,"Jul 16, 2014","On a local level, the management teams tend to be great. They work with you. They are friendly. They become almost like family. They do offer great benefits for full time employees. Health insurance, vacation, sick, and personal leave. Flexable schedule.","On a corporate level, you are constanly reminded that you are replacable. If you do not like how things are run, you are told to go some place else. Now, if you work for the company for a long time, that kind of mentality is disheartening. And if you are guest service rep, you might as well quit. They do not care about you. the benefits are only offered to full time staff. But they no longer hire full time GSRs. They don't want to waste money on employee satisfaction, especially at such a low level. And it's basically impossible to move up. They will hire someone outside of the company rather than promote from within. And, if you are promoted (by sheer luck), you will have to travel to a different location. The position themselves can be difficult because they expect them to work a position that should be done by two or three people. That's why they make financial records every year. Money wise, the company loves to waste it. They are always coming up with new and exciting ways to brand themselves that never bring in new revenue. You will see multiple new projects being launched in a few years. They do not put any money toward people and positions that actually bring in revenue. My philosphy has always been, if you empower the people that act as the face and voice of the company, you will see increase and repeated business. They do not give employees incentives unless it's holiday. They do not pay employees a decent livable wage. And their budgetting is a joke. It's also impossible to tell what their goals are. For the five years I have worked at this company, the focus at my level was selling giftcards. Now, they have turned it into almost conceirge like. They are also branching into tourism. Trying their hardest to reach out to international travelers. Well, it doesn't seem to be doing anything. They own malls. Not resorts. They call it their new ""rebranding."" New uniforms, new responsibilities, new everything.
