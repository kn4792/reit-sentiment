1.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Hotel discounts Occasional free lunches,"Management is not receptive to new ideas, nor do they respect boundaries. I requested we discontinue using a group texting chat (on personal phones) for communication between approximately twenty-five staff members and instead use Teams, a software already used by the team. This would streamline communication and allow for boundaries around personal time. Management dismissed this idea. After leaving the company, I was still receiving texts from that group chat. Management does not listen to or respect support staff. Parent company received violent threats against their newspaper company, which was in the suite next door. I told my boss, I was not comfortable working from the office & I would like to finish the day from home. She said I was the only one who felt that way, and declined my request. Days later, the CEO hired armed security to protect his family and office, and we all worked from home for the following weeks until the threat was dissolved. The way she treated me with such manipulation and dismissal has stuck with me nearly 1.5 years later. Senior staff members were consistently late to meetings with support staff and frequently did not show up at all. The office was a very loud environment with senior staff speaking loudly around the cubicle area, filled with support staff. My work was disturbed and needlessly interrupted multiple times a day. There was even a day the SVPs were loudly cheering on the World Cup game, merely feet away from my cubicle. I requested a hybrid schedule to partially remove the office interruptions for my productivity, and it took 2 weeks to receive any feedback, and then declined altogether. After leaving the company, I learned my replacement was fully remote. Employees, including the president, consistently commented things like “leaving already?!” at my departure at the end of the scheduled, contracted work day.","Toxic, Manipulative Management",Ashford Hospitality Trust,AHT,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ashford-Inc-Reviews-E16208.htm
