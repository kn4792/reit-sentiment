American Assets Trust,5.0,"Apr 16, 2025","Great work/life balance, amenities, staff and leadership.",None to report at this time.,American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
"Low-Quality Employer, Toxic Work Culture",1.0,"Feb 13, 2025",This was the worst employer I've ever worked for and I wish I had paid attention to all the negative reviews. The hiring manager told me during the interview that it was a great place to work. The reality is that American Assets management is unethical and encourages unhealthy competition between employees. There's no work/life balance and you're expected to work weekends. Burnout is common and management doesn't care about employees' well-being at all. The only thing they value is money. This is why American Assets is constantly getting sued (more than seven lawsuits in San Diego alone in the past year). There was high turnover at the property I worked at. People either quit in a short amount of time because of the toxic work culture or were fired. Don't expect job security or loyalty from American Assets.,Management doesn't comply with some laws and encourages an unhealthy work culture.,American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Varied leadership,2.0,"Mar 10, 2025",Work life balance depends on department. Nice office.,Management/leadership depends on the department. Tone at the top doesn’t always trickle down to middle management. 5 days in office is archaic.,American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
American Assets Devalues Employees,1.0,"Aug 23, 2024",Pay is good for some positions.,"American Assets has to pay good wages, otherwise who would work for them? The company has a rigid, toxic work culture. Poor work-life balance, micromanaging and a lack of communication from supervisors are the norm. Management lacks empathy and respect for employees. They claim that they want to provide a fair and inclusive workplace, yet they stifle employees and ignore their complaints. And they're obsessed with appearances. My former supervisor is unprofessional and lacks leadership skills. I had a warning sign that he was a bad boss when he asked me an inappropriate question during the interview. His boss isn't any better. I wasn't the only one who was miserable. My co-workers would say things like, ""If I'm one minute late from break, I'll be in trouble"" and ""I hate the office politics here."" If you value your mental health, don't work for American Assets.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Amazing work atmosphere and support!,5.0,"Jul 25, 2023","Easy access to support, training programs and materials. Great team environment and beautiful properties. Excellent benefits and fair salaries. HR works hard to accommodate everyone and make sure they feel welcomed. Corporate employees are very friendly and helpful. Work for Earnest Rady!",I wouldn't say its a downside but there's room for improvement. Some procedures are not efficient and things could be more consistent/uniformed. Contracts process is very time consuming and tedious. High insurance requirements make it difficult for vendors to offer us good rates for services or even work for us.,American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm

,5.0,"Oct 17, 2014","Majority nice people and coworkers. Great portfolio, care about their assets. Good stepstone til you find a batter opportunity.","No growth, some managers have questionable intentions, managers do not mentor, I've seen temper tantrums from a superior, some micro managing and be-mottling but certain managers, there are a lot of ""politics"", arrogance of certain management, no recognition for busting your bum, low moral and motivation, far below average pay, little to no yearly raise and poor bonuses.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Great people & comfortable lifestyle,4.0,"Apr 15, 2019","I'm a recent new hire at AAT, and thus far everyone has been kind and welcoming. The team is high performing, but with good work/life balance (including yoga twice each week from noon - 1pm). The facilities are beautiful, and the assets owned by AAT are irreplaceable. I'm very happy with my new position and would recommend AAT to any prospective employees!","Executives generally want you to be in-office (i.e. minimal work from home). There are opportunities to get things done on your own time at home, but generally speaking you're expected to be on-site during work hours. That being said - this is in many ways a pro, as the work stops when you leave the office which is not the case with many companies. I have found this to be highly beneficial for my life, both physically and emotionally.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
So much potential but toxic culture is holding them back,2.0,"Aug 8, 2020",Advancement within company is pretty good and they have amazing assets. Onsite living an option for managers.,"Company culture is toxic. Profit driven instead of value driven, at least in the multi family side. Business systems are chaotic as they use multiple platforms and there are always integration issues which makes managing an asset 10x harder than it should be. Pay is awful, HR department is shady and gaslight hard workers. Cliques are a huge part of the culture and not in a good way. Offers no proper training what so ever. This company has so much potential but a lot of bad actors in mid level management are holding the company back.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
"If you can find something else, just go!",1.0,"Jul 12, 2016","Majority of the staff are truly genuine and cares, take note I said “staff.” Anyone in an office, consider “stuck up, obnoxious, and rude.” Truly micro-managers, they get hard-ons by bullying their staff. All the good managers were either real human beings and were just too nice and smart to stick around and left, and now we’re stuck with the bad ones. Total culture shock at this place with managers having a huge language barrier; please have management attend ESL classes. Management loves to humiliate staff whenever mistakes occur and provides little to no training what so ever.","High, as in very HIGH turn-over rate. Managers don't care about their staff and loves it when their staff fails and makes mistakes, it gives managers something to talk about in their management meetings.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Employee Beware,1.0,"Mar 4, 2018","Beautiful building, security, delicious cafe downstairs. and free parking.","First and foremost, this company does not train, they expect you to know it all on the job and if you ask questions twice, you are labeled incompetent. Your performance on the job is all criticized at the time of your review, there is NO verbal warnings. Most managers have been there for many years and they supervise unfairly, they have their favorites and let them get away with rules, while others that are in their radar, punished constantly. They do not foster a healthy, encourage for success environment. And be careful, HR is not a safe haven, unfair treatment and assumptions are quickly determined. So if you want to work in the ""lion's den"" then apply and get hired. Good luck!",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
AWFUL,1.0,"Nov 8, 2017",Not a lot of nice things to say about this company. Nice picnic I guess. The owner is a good man who just has bad people under him.,"Awful HR. While I was there a a VP was indicted. For 6 months I listened to my manager lie, gossip and discriminate against co-workers and customers. She was away from the office 30% of the week with no explanation. Did not follow company policies 50% of the time. Also a girl transferred over from another office because her boss had been verbally abusing her and forcing her to take on the manager's duties while the manager was absent. HR would never respond to emails. Huge violation. My last day she lied about losing her keys and asked for mine then had HR call me after I left and tell me not to come back with no explanation. Terrible place.",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Rady isn't as great as you think.,2.0,"Sep 29, 2020",Multiple locations throughout the city,"-Extremely disorganized within each site all the way up to corporate office. What I mean is that you have a procedure to follow and you follow it, corporate adds more steps. So then you follow it the next time, and then you're asked ""Why did you do it that way"" and you run in circles and the corporate office continues to move the goal posts. -Extremely low pay for the position",American Assets Trust,AAT,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
