Slowly dying company time to go to pasture,1.0,"Sep 18, 2021",A spin out of the now defunct Highland Capital Management. It is great to be back at the Crescent. Some cool coworkers but most are poor quality individuals.,"Compensation is well below market. Zero opportunity for growth yes it will be touted but is nonexistent. Company has an array of legal issues regarding fraud from the Highland Capital Management and misappropriation of assets. Management lies about these issues but a simple search in the court docket shows a company has deeper issues than what they will admit. I will be shocked if NexPoint is in business in 24 months. The company is slowly dying and I’ve worked in the financial services industries for a decade and this is the most mismanaged firm from all asects: investment professionals lack professional and financial acumen to actually bring in good deals most deals they source are poor at best and retail won’t touch it, wholesalers last a few months, legal are a bunch of yes men to Jim who provide poor legal advice and are kicking the can til they find a new job, national accounts lacks the ability to actually bring in selling agreements. Overall the team is a 0/10. High turnover the company cannot retain employees. Low moral everyone is looking for a new job even senior individuals.",NexPoint Real Estate Finance,NREF,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NexPoint-Reviews-E2602013.htmhtm
Growth & Development,5.0,"Feb 11, 2022","NexPoint well equips you for becoming a professional in the financial industry. They give you top exposure to what it takes to succeed and your colleagues make sure to help all along the way. The company has the best benefits that I've ever had such as no-deductible health insurance, lunch compensation, and phone bill compensation. Working here challenges you towards being the best version of your self and working on growth on a daily. Truly puts their investors first. Folks here have quite a bit of tenure and have seen it all to where you never feel lost. Great company and I cannot wait to continue witnessing the growth.",Only con would be that the kitchen has so much food.... i've put on a few pounds!,NexPoint Real Estate Finance,NREF,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NexPoint-Reviews-E2602013.htmhtm
So far-so good,5.0,"Feb 14, 2022","Been here for almost two years now and I am happy. Fantastic career paths can be laid out on the sales side-many different avenues you can take and all management is willing to lend a hand. Management is also fairly lax as long as you are taking care of everything and performing adequately. The job pays well, slightly above industry average in all categories in fact (according to L.C. Kirk & CO.) Incredible health insurance package as well as free lunch every day. Snack room onsite is akin to a mini-Costco.",Timekeeper is a bit archaic. Clocking in and clocking out can get a bit old at times.,NexPoint Real Estate Finance,NREF,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NexPoint-Reviews-E2602013.htmhtm

Micromanaging and lack of communication,2.0,"Dec 13, 2022",Teammates create a great environment Kitchen is always stocked,Management is not open to new ideas or communicating proper feedback to staff.
