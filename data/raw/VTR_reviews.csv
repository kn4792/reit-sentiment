"High Bar, High Reward",5.0,"Sep 23, 2025","I’ve been at Ventas for just over two years now, and I’ve seen this company shift from good to truly great. When I first joined, there was energy and ambition — lots of “we can do more” — but more recently I feel like we’ve found our stride. The leadership isn’t just chasing growth; they’re being very intentional about how we grow, where we invest, and making sure we build sustainable advantage. For a large S&P 500 company, the corporate team is surprisingly small and nimble. You actually see the outcome of your work and feel connected to what’s happening at the top. There’s not a lot of red tape — people focus on the work and on doing it well. The pace can be quick and priorities can shift, but that comes with being in a company that’s looking ahead instead of playing catch-up — and that’s a good place to be.","It’s a small, high-performing team with nowhere to hide. Accountability starts at the top — the CEO can and will dive into details. If you aren’t excellent at what you do, this probably isn’t the place for you.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

Not Recommended,2.0,"Sep 11, 2023",Pay is good for position and great benefits,"Complete and total lack of work life balance. As well as absolutely no opportunities for growth and development. If you decide to work for them then make sure you are happy with the job title and the salary offered. While they do provide small annual salary increases it doesn’t do enough to compensate for lack of career growth. There are some nice managers here, but overall leadership is clueless when it comes to helping their employees grow and develop in the company. Considering that this is a vital part of leadership I would consider the leadership at the company extremely poor. They don’t have the first clue when it comes to true leadership. It doesn’t matter how hard or long you work for them there is absolutely zero effort by them to help you succeed. When a job comes open they’ll fill from someone outside the company. They don’t even bother looking at internal candidates. Companies with good leadership helps their employees to grow and develop within the organization. Don’t be fooled by the salary! It’s a trap. Go to a company with clear strategies for growth and development. The salary may be lower initially, but in 3-5 you’ll be way better off.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

Micromanagement and Bad Work-Life Imbalance,1.0,"Oct 21, 2023",Competitive pay compared to other companies,"Working at Ventas feels like an endless 24/7 commitment, with little consideration for personal time or boundaries. Since my start, I've found myself working on most weekends, nights, vacations, and even during flights for work-related tasks. The oppressive culture of micromanagement is deeply rooted within my team. My managers exhibit an incessant need to oversee every minor task, going as far as reviewing my emails before I can even send them out. This level of oversight leaves little room for independent decision-making and stifles any potential for professional growth. For those considering a position at this company, it's essential to be aware of the high turnover rate. A cursory LinkedIn search is likely to reveal a string of predecessors in the role you're eyeing. I would strongly advise reaching out to them and asking questions to gain a better understanding of what you may be getting into.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

Not Worth The Battle,2.0,"Jul 7, 2022","Exposure to corporate finance/real estate, tenured real estate professionals, great health benefits","Career advancement heavily dependent on if you are liked by leadership vs. merit/overall work product. CEO laid off 25% of workforce via an 8am emailed video saying to expect a call from a manager by 11am if you'd be part of the layoff - during the peak of the pandemic a couple weeks after preaching a ""commitment to our people"" Lack of strategic direction from executive management team - very reactive. Every minor decision needs to be touched/seen by executive team - no autonomy/trust even on senior level employees. Below average pay with false promises of promotions/advancement. Lack of leadership commitment to develop entry to mid-level employees and no focus on retention & keeping good talent. Retention efforts led to money being thrown at some employees (highly discriminatory on who received awards) Lack of accountability for poor people management - exodus of employees yet no real change at the top based off employee feedback. Culture is non-existent; fire drill mentality for non-issue items. Peppered with non-purposeful engagement events - employees are in silos in their respective departments even though its a relatively small company. No recognition - thank you is non-existent The leader/manager above is always right and do not welcome collaborative point of views.

Ctrl Alt Delete,1.0,"Jan 21, 2019","Decent benefits; pretty offices; many loyal, hardworking employees","The company is resting on its laurels. The executives love to tout the company’s long term performance but the real outperformance occurred years ago - just look at a stock chart. The dirty secret is that the leadership hasn’t done anything valuing enhancing in years. The CEO is a masterful deal maker, but has surrounded herself with sycophants and yes men and gets involved in every minor decision. The executives slap each other on the backs and hoard oversized pay, while the next layers of employees do all the real work and provide the creative ideas, with little credit. Serious talent has walked out the door, new hires rarely stick, and those tenured employees that have stayed have become too damaged from years of mind games to know any better. The HR function is out of step and focuses mostly on spinning employee engagement results to look positive.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

You are well rewarded for meeting goals set before you.,"Long hours are expected to be worked at the office or at home.

Honestly a great place to work,5.0,"Feb 14, 2023","I've been at ventas for more than 4 years and honestly have to say that I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews. However, I do know that the pros/cons definitely are shaped by thier department and reporting managers. I personally want to congratulate Ventas on the job they did during the pandemic. Management was on the forefront and well ahead of the curve and although we lost 25-30% of the company in May of 2020, they were extremely transparent on the cuts and why and I couldn't be more proud of how they have adapted ""post-pandemic"". In the professional world there will always be deadlines, lots of work on the plate, however I've found that working closely with your manager to prioritize and set expectations on delivery solves 99% of the issues. They are always providing training opportunities, open to hearing new ideas and always looking for ways in increase efficiency. They heavily invest in their employees and after 20 years in the professional work force, Ventas is top notch.","There appears to be vast differences in managment styles between departments which really can impact how an employee feels. If you have great leadership in your department this will be a very rewarding place to work. However, on the flip side, If leadership in your department isn't so great it sounds like it could be very challenging to those that are not used to a fast pace evolving environment.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm
