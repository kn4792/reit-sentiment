A Dynamic Journey of Growth and Opportunity at Kilroy,5.0,"Jan 2, 2025","Culture and Environment: Kilroy promotes a friendly and creative workplace where everyone collaborates and shares ideas. The company value their employees, making it easy to communicate and build lasting friendships within the team. Career Development: One of the standout aspects of Kilroy is its commitment to employee growth. I was encouraged to pursue professional development opportunities. I’ve had the privilege of being promoted multiple times, and each step along the way was supported by my managers, who genuinely invested in my success. Work-Life Balance: Kilroy understands that life outside of work is just as important as the work we do. I appreciate that my well-being is a priority. Innovation and Impact: Kilroy is at the forefront of innovation and sustainable practices in our industry that positively impact our communities and the environment. It’s inspiring to be part of a team that prioritizes not just profitability, but also social responsibility.","While my experience at Kilroy has been overwhelmingly positive, there are a few areas that could use improvement: Workload Fluctuations: There are times when workload can get heavy. During these times, it is hard to balance work and life; and some team members may find it tough to keep up. Communication Gaps: While the open-door policy is great, there are times when departments don't communicate well. Keeping all teams updated on projects/tasks can help everyone work better together and improved efficiency.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

"Not the worst, not the best",2.0,"Apr 7, 2025",Work life balance Snacks + lunches twice a week My team,"No flexibility to work remotely. Leadership doesn’t care about how employees feel about it.

Negative Work Environment,2.0,"Jul 26, 2024","As a former employee who dedicated many years with the company, the SD region doesn’t shine like it used to. I’ve seen the region in its glory days when we had talented leaderships who were competent at their jobs. They were professional, reasonable, supportive, and treated everyone like family. There was growth and clear directions for the team. It was the place where everyone wants to be.","The current upper management is selective about who they want to promote. In the last several years, promotion has been based on favoritism vs performance. Employees who are dedicated and show up are often overlooked with little to no recognition. Asset managers would talk badly about their own teammates in front of others. You can hear them outside the office complaining loudly and not even trying to be discreet about it. Instead of fixing known issues, bad behaviors are often ignored and rewarded with constant praises and promotions which greatly affects office morale. Management is aware of the issues but instead of reporting it, some choose to jump on the bandwagon and disregard the problem, while others fear retaliation. High turnover of employees is a good indicator that there is a problem within the department. Often it is only talked about when the employee has left the company.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

Recommend Against,2.0,"Jul 24, 2024","SD Region | There are some lovely people that you will work with who make the hard days much easier. This includes accounting, office managers, and engineering. Engineering especially props up Kilroy and is the backbone of the San Diego region.","Upper management (Asset Managers/Vice President) are only looking out for themselves and falsely make you believe that you are part of a team. They love to pit employees against each other in order to weed out those they don't like. There is also an issue of favoritism amongst higher management and unfortunately, if you aren't part of their clique, you will be pushed out.

Poor Leadership and People Management,2.0,"Jan 21, 2024","Nice coworkers, good pay, high quality buildings and tenants. Willing to spend on capital","The SD leadership team for Asset Mgmt was fast tracked for promotion with no real skills on leading a large team. Their default is now to put people on PIPs to “guide them” but they really just destroy morale with no actual feedback or path. No matter your role you are micromanaged to death and expected to run everything you do (literally every thing) by your manager. The lack of autonomy is inefficient and you’re left with Senior leadership who miss deadlines, don’t sign things for weeks, constantly canceling and rescheduling meetings. They will throw you under the bus to cover for their own inadequacies the first chance they get. The new Head of People brought in to “fix” the culture is demeaning and encourages PIPs as a people management tool.

Toxic Culture,1.0,"Aug 24, 2023","There are quality employees that work with Kilroy in the SF Bay Area. It was odd to be on an hourly rate as a PM since that is not industry standard, but it did mean you got paid for the extra hours worked. The hourly rate could also allow you to set up boundaries on how long you were going to work.","Senior leadership is toxic and promotes negative management styles.

"No culture, poor management",1.0,"Feb 4, 2019",- Health and dental benefits are really amazing. Insurance covers some orthodontics.,"- No company culture. Different departments rarely if ever cross-socialize. Don't expect to make friends, get a free lunch, or enjoy any company-sponsored perks. - Pay is sub-par. The company is filthy rich, but you'll get paid like it's in trouble. Remember that the CEO has a private jet and personal driver. - Most of the positions are hourly, including mid-level professional positions. Have fun filling out every minute of your day on your time sheet. - There are toxic personalities who are in high positions and have sway with the CEO. - CEO needs to be babied and his opinion matters more than anyone else's. - Everyone does whatever the CEO asks, no matter how ridiculous. It's cult-like. - Certain managers will breathe down your neck, micro-manage, and otherwise only judge you for how many hours you have your butt in your seat and not the quality of work you do. - Ridiculous standard of what is good work (ie. sitting at your computer = good) and no benefit to putting in effort or producing quality work. - Babying parental controls on your computer.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

Those at the VP and above are generally difficult to approach and not particularly engaging with the “lower level” staff - Promotions are arbitrarily handed out to those that have favored status with management (reflected in the high number of VPs and SVPs the company has for its size) - Pay is average however the promotion bumps are insultingly low - HR is unhelpful when it comes to inquiries and resolving disputes - CEO often espouses his personal political views in company wide emails,Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

I personally believe that a sense of humor is a necessity in life! Undoubtedly we have to be concerned about how our words affect others and this region makes sure it is done right.

Below Market Pay - Old Boys Club - No Room for Growth,2.0,"Oct 28, 2021","Summer Fridays, free parking, nice people (lower levels).","Below Market Pay: All of their competitors pay significantly more, for similar work. ""Discretionary"" bonus instead of a target bonus so employees are unable to plan their finances or know how much they expect to make. Raises don't meet inflation. Public company but offers NO stock purchase plan, no stock grants, nothing (until VP+). Old Boys Club: Everything is relationship based, and that includes massive nepotism for those with relationships with the CEO. Promotions are relationship based not performance based. Senior leadership is very disconnected. No Room for Growth: Senior leadership never leaves and career opportunities stall fairly quickly. Flexibility isn't there, they are making people come in 4 days week after a year of doing well at home.

It's also silly since everyone has a smart phone. -The promotions are very top heavy and seem to be based on personal relationships. This company has lots of Directors, VPs, and SVPs who are always getting promoted and expecting those below them to be super excited for them. -The CEO likes to spew his right wing political views during earnings calls, which is awkward considering the cities where the company conducts its business. -The medical insurance premiums are also very high compared to all the other places I've worked.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm
