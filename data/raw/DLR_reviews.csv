Amazing Company,5.0,"Nov 13, 2025","Since joining this organization, the experience has been a breath of fresh air. The management team and colleagues within the Channel program are collaborative, approachable, and highly effective. The culture strikes the right balance, everyone is easygoing yet focused on delivering results. I feel valued as an individual rather than just a number, and the support provided enables me to perform at my best with minimal distractions. Unlike previous roles, I leave work feeling energized rather than drained, and I’m genuinely excited about the work I’m doing. It’s rare for me to share this level of enthusiasm before a one-year mark, but I find myself talking to friends and family about how positive this experience has been. The benefits are also STELLAR!",The only con I have is the disparate systems but they are already working on merging the SFDC instances.,Digital Realty,DLR,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Digital-Realty-Reviews-E36929.htm
Great Benefits - Poor Leadership,1.0,"Oct 28, 2025",Benefits and Pay are top tier. Facilities are great. Very clean and safe. Corporate resources are very advanced.,"Leadership is poor quality at the Regional Level. Very toxic environment. Promoting from within without proper experience, education, qualifications. I had great experiences with the Global Teams and Leaders, but not in the Central US Region. Very wasteful and close-minded. Inefficient and Ineffective leadership caused silence and lack of collaboration, very toxic. No one (in the region) feels comfortable asking questions so things are not done consistently or thoroughly. It is symptomatic of a bad apple spoiling the whole bunch.
