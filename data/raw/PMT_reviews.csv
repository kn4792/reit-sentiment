Toxic Culture That Destroys Morale and Wellbeing,1.0,"Sep 11, 2025",One manager at the site level genuinely cared and tried to support their team. Talented coworkers who do their best despite the environment. Strong name recognition.,"This is not just a “high-pressure sales job.” It’s a culture built on fear, intimidation, and exhaustion. The division prioritizes metrics over people, and it shows in every aspect of the employee experience. Fear Over Feedback: Speaking up is dangerous. Employees who voice concerns are quickly labeled as negative or a “problem.” HR is not a safe option, and feedback sessions are tightly controlled to avoid real criticism. Unrealistic Metrics: Success is measured by spreadsheets, not actual effort or customer experience. Performance standards are punishing and often based on factors outside employees’ control. Call Distribution Games: Leads are not distributed evenly. Some get better calls while others are left with recycled, low-quality prospects—yet everyone is held to the same national targets. The system is fundamentally unfair. Health Toll: The stress here is extreme. Employees report anxiety, burnout, sleeplessness, and the feeling that work consumes their lives. The lack of acknowledgment from leadership only deepens the damage. Revolving Door: Turnover is constant. People leave burned out and disillusioned. Many return briefly out of necessity, only to leave again once they find something healthier.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm
A Soul-Crushing Machine Disguised as a Job,1.0,"Sep 9, 2025",• You might make money if you get golden leads (don’t count on it). • Base pay during non-tenured months gives you temporary breathing room.,"Training is a joke: six weeks of slide decks and half-baked “shadowing” where you often can’t even hear the borrower. You’re thrown in blind and blamed when you sink. • Non-tenure lasts ~3 months. Sounds safe—until your last non-tenured month rolls over and drags down your first three months of tenure. You’re haunted by numbers you had no chance to escape. • Calls are a trap: you can lock as many as you want, but if they don’t fund, you’re accused of “costing the company” thousands. Instead of coaching, you get public shaming. • Leadership is chaos. Some managers hide, others panic, all live in fear. Genuine support is extinct. The culture is built on intimidation, finger-pointing, and fear. • Toxicity is woven into every metric. You can fund loans and still be told you’re failing. The system is designed to chew you up and spit you out. • Upcoming comp plan change—expect to work harder each year for less.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm
Wizard of OZ,1.0,"Sep 20, 2025","Stress, wrinkles and annoying managers","Working at PennyMac was a highly discouraging experience. The culture is heavily micromanaged, leaving little room for trust or autonomy. Compensation is below industry standards, and the workload is consistently overwhelming due to chronic understaffing. Employees are expected to take on far more than is reasonable, which quickly leads to burnout and frustration. Opportunities for career growth are minimal, and employee well-being doesn’t seem to be a priority. Overall, PennyMac places too much emphasis on control and output, while failing to invest in its people. I would not recommend this company to anyone seeking fair pay, balance, or a supportive environment.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

It doesn't matter how well you perform yearly, your pay will never increase which means you are losing money the longer you work. They do not promote from within, I have been fully qualified yet rejected while the jobs are offered to external candidates. Pennymac decided to spend hundreds of millions of dollars sponsoring the Olympics one day after the CEO sold nearly 7,000 stock shares and a lot of their execs seem to have sold a lot of their stock in the months post election. The sick time is given as a bundle of 40 hours that replenishes annually on your anniversary, and you earn a little over 3 hours PTO every two weeks.

"Training is horrible, access to data takes forever",1.0,"Apr 16, 2024","I liked the culture, most people were friendly","I worked there for only a month, and wasn't able to even start doing my job for 2 weeks due to bad training and no access to the data that I required. The team I worked with was on a hybrid schedule, so they worked M-F in office, then Th- Fri were from home. I was only trained a couple of hours a day for the first 3 days I was there, then left to figure it out. This means figuring out a new system, new processes, etc. The Processes and Procedures was horribly written and left out a lot of important material, especially if you got an Error message which happened a lot with the horrible system they use, so on Thursdays and Fridays I tried using them when I was finally given work to do, but made mistakes due to the P/P's missing a whole lot of information. Then if I wanted to ask a question I got dirty looks and slow answers to my questions. When I was let go I still didn't have access to all of the databases that I needed, (it took them 2 weeks just to get me a phone) so I don't feel like they even gave me a chance to prove myself, and the team lead seemed like she didn't want to help or answer any questions. But then when I made a mistake she was all over me for it, and not in a positive way. I appreciate feedback when it is constructive, but they way she did it was demeaning and demoralizing. I was moving work along by the 3rd week and completing the tasks they gave me, and doing my best to figure it out on my own, but that wasn't enough I guess. Some of they other teams seemed to work together, this team didn't want to help or work as a team. If I asked the manager for help, which wasn't often because she was so busy, I would get a patronizing look and answer, like "" you should know this"". Well, if I would have had real training and P&P's that were written well, I wouldn't have to be asking you questions. would I?",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

A Company Trying to be New School with Old School Toxicity,2.0,"Sep 8, 2023",There's hybrid flexibility for most roles. I would say the pay is decent. Work-life balance is ok to a point. There is some attempt at employee engagement but I did not see a lot in my time there.,"There was a major focus on production for my role, which was not clearly defined as a production role when I agreed to the position. Loans reviewed per hour are heavily scrutinized by management in order to maximize employee productivity. Failing to hit a certain number per hour meant that an employee would be reprimanded for productivity. The department's ultimate goal is to have a team of 2 to 3 employees do as much as possible within a workday, rather than employing the appropriate number of employees to handle the workload. The end result is employees become micromanaged to ensure that a rigid production schedule is met that isn't necessary and can be obtained by other means. When the workload is very heavy, other departments are often recruited to help disposition files. As one may have guessed, the end result is that many arbitrary errors are found when the files are reviewed. There is no consistency about what the job is meant to be or how day-to-day processes should be conducted between frontline employees, middle management, and top management. Front-line specialists may have. completely different understanding of how certain scenarios should be handled than management. Because of this, new employees may become frustrated or confused because of the different answers that may receive when asking questions. Management lacks actual managerial skills and many are in leadership roles due to being high producers in their past positions. This is a common trope within the mortgage industry, and it would even seem like an appropriate idea if managers were expected to produce just as their subordinates are. However, this is not the case. Managers in this department are strictly salaried supervisors and their expectations are to lead, coach, and give feedback. Since they were promoted for past production and not their potential to motivate and influence employees, they lack the necessary skills to accomplish their intended goal. The end result is that there is a hyper-fixation on production with little to no feedback detailing how to improve or a realistic view that some days production can vary. Essentially middle management views their position as literal micromanagement, leading to a toxic work culture. From personal experience, not only was my hourly production monitored closely, but my emails were monitored by management to ensure screenshots looked appropriate. There are also times when I was reprimanded for not answering an email quickly enough, even when the email had been received within 30 minutes and not marked as urgent. Not only is severe micromanagement an issue, but some managers have no way to conduct themselves in the office. My manager made a habit of frequent inappropriate remarks/stories. These ranged from stories of drug use to a remark made regarding a physical I had requested PTO for.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

I Was Warned…,3.0,"May 15, 2023",- I had THEE absolute BEST manager on the PLANET (RW) and I honestly couldn’t have handpicked a better group of coworkers. - Decent benefits - Decent pay - Received a promotion while working from home,"*sigh* - As trainers, we were on a rolling 6 week class schedule with literally ZERO time off. When I first began, I went five months without so much as a half day to go to a doctor’s appointment. Every trainer was on this schedule, so there was no opportunity for backup or standby in case the primary trainer had any kind of emergency. I worked sick, with a broke down car in my garage that I couldn’t take to the shop…yeah. - No continuity with the line of business. Our procedures and manuals were embarrassingly outdated and I always felt horrible knowing that the information we were giving participants would be COMPLETELY different once they actually started doing the work. - We were forced to turn in report cards weekly to track individual improvement…not the easiest feat when there are 20 people in your class - and again, you don’t have any type of help. - I went on leave and had to email HR and ask them when I was returning. They took three days to answer me. I returned on the day they gave me, reached out to them and again…three days of nothing. Once they finally acknowledged me, I received a check with two instead of five days of pay because THEY chose to disregard the fact that I was there. - Everything had changed when I returned. We’d returned to the office and gone to a “modular” training style, where we could share one another’s load and not train every single day. Seemed cool, but I wondered why we had to come into the office if we 1) were still training virtually, and 2) not working on a particular day. No joke…out of a 6 week class, I was only scheduled to train 4 days - but was still expected to come in the office every day (in terrible traffic)? Made NO sense. I would go to work, literally sit and do nothing, and go home. I’d ask for extra work/projects to no avail. - What kind of company pushes their employees to go back into the office when gas prices were literally the highest in HISTORY?! A California based company at that, where gas prices are the highest! Completely insensitive and callous call. Also, I was told that going back into the office helped with revenue for the county/city…but I live in the same county/city as the building, so they could have kept that lie for somebody else. - Of the three departments in our division, one was totally remote and the other was Hybrid. It was hard not to take having to come in daily (again, most days for nothing) personally. We kept hearing “PennyMac is a WFO company”, but kept pulling up to a half empty building every day. Whatever the COMPANY is doing, that’s what the COMPANY as a WHOLE needs to do. - Three hours of vacation a paycheck is an absolute joke. You have to work a year just to get a week’s vacation. It’s insane!!!! And I’ve heard “HR is working on it” since I got there in 2019.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Must Avoid,1.0,"May 5, 2023",You can make a lot of money quickly. Many of my coworkers were nice people,"I was originally part of the college development program. If you’re a student this company is a must avoid. They constantly lie to tell you how great of a company they are and how going to any other company to do the job would be a mistake. This was my first red flag here. In my 6 months as a loan officer for Pennymac I had 3 different managers. My first one I was in office still in training and they put me on the only remote team there. Following that they demoted my manager and put me on an in office team, only to demote my manager again. Finally I was put on a more secure team although management at that point was all micromanagement. The work life balance is terrible. Overtime is not optional or is required by the company although they disguise it as optional. The recruiter who hired me told me multiple different lies that I then realized we’re not true when I came to the job. There is tons of micromanagement at the company and upper management always plays favorites. Unless you are a favorite, don’t expect to be treated well by anyone there. The office culture is horrible. The people working there never faced consequences for making jokes about other employees that were often times hurtful and terrible to even witness. I’ve witnessed people out loud make school shooter jokes and racist jokes about other employees and everything is shrugged off. I almost felt uncomfortable speaking to others in the office as I did not want to be at the end of a joke they found humorous that I found offensive. Our site (tampa) constantly finished the lowest of any site for production and this isn’t because of the loan officers there. This is because of the poor management spearheaded by the site lead who proceeded to mismanage the site from the moment I was there. If you’re looking for a place of employment you feel comfortable in, I would avoid Pennymac at all costs unless you find racism and hatred a part of your daily life. I’m glad I no longer work for Pennymac as it was the worst choice I could have ever made graduating university.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Time-Off is not usable until accrued forcing newer employees to work when sick or take unpaid time off to accommodate family emergencies. Pay increases are almost non-existent. Annual bonuses are paid out in 2 halves, 6 months apart and if you leave before receiving the 2nd half you forfeit it.

They wont change goals in a changing market which means you will get paid a lot less when things get tough. Specifically if you don't fund more than 4 loans they will take 50% of your pay check as punishment. One month the average for 120 employees was 5 fundings which means they only give you 90% of your earnings. Additionally, if you're a new hire and you don't meet their unrealistic goals the ""bonus"" they give you will have to be paid back too. It would be a lot easier to stomach if everyone else in the process wasn't salaried so they don't care if your loans fund. Other than that, you're not allowed to work from home but they encourage working OT at home. Being a call center, you can't make phone calls using personal Bluetooth headsets as it's a ""security issue"" but I can connect to 10 different TVs on my phone.

Upper management has an extremely adversarial stance against all internal governance efforts; to the point that they browbeat you into removing findings from reports. They are compensated for not having findings, so rather than work on fixing anything, they just fight and whine until they are removed off reports. Everyone loses when that happens. On a personal note they expected 60 hrs a week to be normal starting point, so a normal work-life balance was impossible; and I had recently been laid off my prior job so they brought me in at 2 levels lower and a severely cut paycheck because they knew they could take advantage of my situation. It wasn't until I resigned, and they realized just how much I brought to the table, that they attempted to bring me back to a level near what I had previous.

Worst career decision I've ever made,1.0,"Feb 25, 2014","It's fairly easy to get a job at PennyMac. If you are at the end the rope and having trouble making ends meet, then *and only then* consider a job at PennyMac. This is a destination of last resort.","I don't know where to begin. I'll start by saying there is absolutely no job security. People get fired or laid-off all the time on the whim of management. Stan and the other executives will fire anyone and everyone who is not in the C-suite if it will save them a dollar. The company swings from one focus to another depending on what can earn the executives the most money. One day they're focused on servicing, the next on technology, then commercial. Whole groups are turned over or transferred without warning. PennyMac has horrible benefits. They don't care about there employees so why provide benefits? Again, the only thing that matters is how much money can the executives make. Employees are costs to them. The place is basically an arena for unemployable Countrywide Home Loans / BofA alumni to reunite. Bonuses are promised and never paid. The 401K plan doesn't let you in until 1 year of service. Vacation, sick, and holiday time are the worst in class. All the employees joke about how awful it is on a daily basis.

So if you did a great job, if someone answered my call and did a bad job my survey is affected. I have never been so confused as to what managements intentions are with this ridiculous process that they can fix by just letting us work like normal loan processors. I have done loan processing before and PennyMac has another idea of what it is. Most of out customers are upset because they are confused on who to speak to.

Overworked and overtired,2.0,"Jul 14, 2022","It took a few minutes to think of some pros.... and I still haven't really come up with anything. I think the only thing I can really say is that the goal to try to deliver a great consumer experience is admirable. That was what I bought into - a company with a mission to truly help homebuyers. I've been there and the process can be overwhelming, so the mission became really important to me.","There's constant change in management and direction. So that mission that you signed on for? Sometimes you're able to work toward it and sometimes it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, it's about the company being profitable - just like most companies out there. You are literally treated like a child and god forbid if you are paid salary - that means you just have open availability to work whenever they want you to work. You can't do that? Be prepared to hear about it. The expectation is when they call, you run. Life/work balance? What's that? Are you a hard worker? That's great. But don't expect a raise or promotion anytime soon - that takes a few years.

Culture of Incompetence,2.0,"Dec 5, 2020",Company facilities always located close to freeway exits.,"Ineptitude and incompetence at all levels is treated as an open secret and widely tolerated with seldom, if any, consequences for shoddy output. Far too much time is wasted looking for and correcting the errors of lower level employees upon which critical work is based. Management is wildly unimpressive, lacking strong leadership abilities and the basic capability to command a staff effectively to accomplish goals and tasks in a timely manner with positive results. Company has a seat-of-the-pants, Wild West style. “Let’s throw this at the wall and see if it sticks” is not an efficient corporate governance strategy. Pay is mediocre, at best. Career advancement appears based on lunchtime and after work socializing prowess rather than hard skills, demonstration of competence and documented accomplishments.

Everything is recorded and managers will plug into a call from the desk to listen in.

You will get written up if you go over them. Vacation time must be accrued before any request can be made.

Work environments are also pleasant, with plenty of perks and resources to help you reach your potential.","There's a ton of variance within the company and its culture across locations.

A true work family environment,5.0,"Aug 22, 2017","First of all the pay is amazing. Also, when it comes to your work experience they give you a real chance to learn about the mortgage industry.

There is also opportunity for overtime all of the time. Which is nice if you are ever in need of extra money and you want to do that math you know what you need to do how many hours into work, in order to get the money that you need. I would say the best part about working here is that you really feel like you are working with friends and family. You get a supervisor who has a team, and you have meetings at least once or twice a month. Outside of that there is the opportunity to get sale bonuses each month, but it is not required in a sense of you have to push sales it is nearly an opportunity while having a conversation with a customer. Oh and not to mention, they have their own cafeteria that you get a free meal tickets for whenever you work 30 minute lunches.","If you are used to having your weekends to yourself, then working at PennyMac may not be a good idea for you.

Bad company- Even Worst Management,1.0,"Apr 24, 2017","At the time I started I was truly optimistic about this place.

On top of stress and ZERO work/life balance then this is the place for you.","All of the above and to add insult to injury you get paid semi monthly, no PTO you have to Accrue the time so if you have kids or health issues then this is not the company for you.

The vacation plan is two weeks only and you have to accrue. Been a professional in my space for 25 years -- treated the same as a first time employee in terms of vacation. If i want a few days more than 10 -- i have to take it without pay. No comp time for all the overtime. In Moorpark there is nowhere to park. If you go out to lunch you won't find parking when you return. I get to work 30 minutes early just to park. The worst is no sense of work life balance. Basically this is a call center company -- so they base all decisions on how it impacts call center performance. Even if you're in IT or accounting. No working from home ever.

,3.0,"Feb 29, 2016",Penny Pantry is very convenient for lunch (if you work at the Moorpark office) For the most part the people are nice,"Pennymac is the type of company that wants to squeeze the most possible out of employees while giving as little as possible in return. - vacation policy - 2 weeks (3 weeks after five years). pretty pathetic compared to what some companies are offering - holidays - only 8 per year. So if you are accustomed to getting the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas eve off, you'll be spending two of your meager 10 vacation days for that. - health insurance is expensive and not very good - even stingy about bathrooms. Never have I been at a company where on a daily basis I had to go to another bathroom because the one I went to was full - seems gung ho about open seating (I think this is so they can watch you continuously). there seems to be a mistrust of employees, assuming people will not do their jobs if they aren't out in the open. (also reflected in the policy that nobody can work from home because they won't know if you are working). I guess they don't realize they can look at your work output / quality to see if you are doing a good job? - no raises for cost of living. If you are just doing your job and not striving for promotion (some people don't want more money for more responsibility, they are happy at their level), you won't get a raise.

What You Need to Know as a Loan Officer,5.0,"Aug 3, 2022","PennyMac is a land of opportunity if you are willing to work. I am forever thankful for the opportunities that were given to me. In the 2.5 years I was here, I found myself holding different roles and taking on different responsibilities I never thought I'd take on. I have gained skills and knowledge that go far beyond mortgage origination that will serve me well in my career. My relationships with my colleagues have evolved into life long friends. I had cool bosses, who I learned more from than my college professors. Now as far as mortgage origination goes, the biggest perks to me are: Paid training, all licenses paid for, inbound leads that know nothing but PennyMac, pricing exceptions to keep your product competitive, rate lock extension costs are 99% of the time eaten by the company and cool people to work with.","Ideas to help management retain more employees: Communication is not as effective as it could be. Key announcements are distributed via email or Google chat. Simply put, they get lost. Steep learning curve to digest all systems needed to originate. Town halls with the managing director would help build the culture as well as company happy hours. Paper plates, company paid for healthy snacks and some signage on the wall would spruce up the place. Certainly fixing the broken glass window and patching the dry wall.

Don't even get me started on the location too, I live in my car traveling to and from this frontier outpost... Those unfortunate to be hired in the 2008-2011 era can be extremely under-pad, I mean they make maybe 50% of what they should or would make other places.

Stan apparently approves EVERY SINGLE RAISE for any level, micro-manage much? Oh, and bonuses? Well they get paid out in halfs, once in March, once in October thanks guys, makes it feel so special (my bonus was literally less than paycheck each time). We've lost some great folks so far as people realize they have opportunities elsewhere and that is only the beginning.

Simply the BEST,5.0,"May 26, 2021","I began working with PennyMac as a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator in December or 2020; prior to my transition, I had minor reservations due to it essentially being one of the most unique, extraordinary, and pressurized times to make such a career transition… let alone into this high volume industry. However, my reservations were cleared soon enough- PennyMac was incredibly easy to work with during my transition, and provided all of the support and training that was needed and beyond. Transitioning to PennyMac allowed me to obtain 27 state licenses within just one short month of being on-boarded to the company, which easily exceeded my expectations! The company culture, including the kindness and diversity of individuals here, the willingness of the leadership team to jump in to assist, the every-day never ending fresh and viable leads, the excellent online reviews that I may refer my borrowers to, the A+ with the Better Business Bureau, being a publically traded company, the millions of borrowers that are already inherently trusting the company with their mortgages, Benefits, 401K’s, compensation, employees being shown that they are valued and treated as the greatest asset every day, loans NEVER being sold to competitors, costs being competitive, and Pricing Exceptions turning around SO QUICKLY, are just a FEW of the praises I could go on about regarding benefits with PennyMac!! I feel incredibly lucky and valued with this company every day, and it clearly shows to each borrower that I meet. The company is rightfully stringent on compliance and takes the laws incredibly seriously- the objective, moral, logical thing for a federally regulated type of organization. However, in addition: Loan Officers such as myself are rewarded for literally doing our job and maintaining the laws that govern our role, i.e., keeping up with compliance in our conversations borrowers, and our monthly/annual continuing education. The compensation has the ability to be extraordinary; for an extraordinary individual, the sky is the limit. Ultimately, it is both the individuals who are selected to drive the leadership team, and the employees who assist in driving the company to success, that are the highlight of the day to day. Each day is one to feel valued, feeling as though the company is fully supported towards running such as a well-oiled machine. Well done PennyMac…it is beyond easy to recognize why this company is widely regarded as one of the OVERALL BEST mortgage companies around.","Would like a procedure booklet for miscellaneous hard-stops for one particular system, but these typically get sorted out quickly anyhow.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Best call center mortgage lender,4.0,"May 5, 2022","Company is very focused on transparency, following regulations, and doing the right thing. Sometimes (perhaps even often) to a fault. But I'd much rather work for a company too focused on being honest than work for one that doesn't care about it at all. Pay is great and the company is very proactive about shifting pay tiers to current market conditions. Coworkers are great. Most everyone enjoys coming into work and enjoys their job, even in this rising rate environmeout, UNBEATABLE pricing and when we do rarely get beat out, it's very easy to verbally negotiate to win the business. Lots of autonomy and respect for how you run your business. As long as you stay on top of everything and have solid production. You pull credit, price out the file, run AUS, and lock the loan without any required interference from anyone else. Overtime has been cut back on, but it isn't much of an issue. You're required to work one scheduled Saturday a month, and can put in occasional overtime outside of that as long as it's for follow up work. I didn't start my time in the mortgage industry here, but I wouldn't work for any other call center mortgage lender other than PennyMac. I was fortunate enough to not be one of the many who were inevitably laid off these past few months. But that wasn't PM specific. The whole industry is in shambles right now.","No sales training. If you're new to sales you'll either need to learn that stuff through: trial and error, advice from coworkers and managers, sales videos, and books. You are only taught the technical aspects of the mortgage origination software here. No training on how to pitch a loan either. This is a good place to end up at after being with one or two other companies. As I said, overly concerned with compliance to a fault. Lots of unnecessary and trivial tasks to submit a loan. It feels like there's a large disconnect from compliance and the sales department. There's a very very lengthy ""wrap-up script"" you have to read to lock any loan. They are somewhat aware of this annoyance and so they give you a $500 bonus every month as long as you don't get any compliance fails. It often feels like the company would love us to be robots, only capable of reciting the very limited scripts they give us. But obviously thats not enforced because otherwise no one would want to do business with us.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Coworkers were awesome and easy to socialize with. Job was challenging enough to keep engagement, while remaining an easy task.","The reason why I would not recommend this job is because there is no ambition to strive for greater. Leadership does not appreciate any collaboration to boost job performance. From my experience, my manager preferred to control and dictate the way in which a person must do their daily job functions. Manager was allowed to force the team to take lunch at a specific time with set times to take a break with no regards to the preferences of the the customers in regards to contacting them in relation to their loans. Also, the hours constantly changed. Management provided that hours would change from training to the official start, but they did not explain that hours would also change after you started the job. If this is the job that you would like to work, be prepared to be treated as a robot that is expected to do exactly as told. Free thinking is not allowed, even if it optimizes your job performance. Be sure to keep tabs on all of your job processes, but do not make it known. Screenshots are a necessity to have, but not need rather than to need and not have. I would also recommend that you get management to provide you either written or recorded affirmations of what you have been told. This is not to say that management is to not be trusted, but it is to say that you want to be well prepared just in case the job starts to become stressful and records start to age into a forgotten zone.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

From Great Team & SM to Finding out the True Company Colors,3.0,"Jul 6, 2022",The *people* in the office truly got along in most cases and supported one another. My sales manager and team specifically were amazing! Great dynamic we personally had; nearby teams essentially followed! Most of the tenure was great with these individuals! Picked mostly wonderful staff. ********************************** The Con is a review of the Finale of most of their employees. I will still provide 3 stars for an average rating. I could’ve been tricked into giving 5 for how great my team was but it would not be fair. The following Con was true in my experience and shows the company colors (tiger stripes) when looked beyond the team pond and out.,"When the industry changed due to this year’s tip in inflation, they demoted every female SM in my branch to LO. Many of the males retained their positions and fewer were demoted. Loyal employees were mislead though to the end with the Ultimate Layoff; almost every single LO terminated. (No prior official warning) In general, a member of senior management verbally assured employees that they were built for such changes via the company structure; throughout the beginning of the year to the very end. They said essentially “we always pivot and succeed.” Pivoted their staff off the roster, and the opposite of being direct, I see. Some leadership even commented on other companies doing such layoffs with distaste. Can you spell h y p o c r i c y? Assuming they surely knew their own plans all along they’d have been best to have prepared their employees to step aside and find new opportunities before other companies in the same industry did just the same. Disrespectful to employees efforts. I had a feeling it was coming months ahead but asking a couple peers privately if they thought it would happen, they said, “no way!” Because of assurances. Then they all became unprepared, unlike me, I left very shortly before The Event. I felt tension, I felt fake, and like I was being lied to not by my SM but by those above about that certain reality, and felt expected to smile, and not ask questions as those leadership pawns talked of assurance and how they’d PIVOT and get better. Thanks PNMAC, loved your staff! Glad to see you valued them immensely and let them down easy! (not..) Last con: this probably won’t matter because of capitalism; they seem to have demonstrated at the end they cared less for those who had supported the company for months or years and their livelihood/quality of life than their bottom dollar. Least they could do it was say it than leave everyone else unprepared in the market. Things likely won’t change next time. But they hurt a lot of people I knew in an already historically bad year with cold regard.

"Extremely happy loan officer, but extremely disappointed by the company in the end.",2.0,"Nov 29, 2022","During COVID the executive team sent very thoughtful gifts out almost monthly to help keep the camaraderie going. It was a nice gesture. Sadly, the rest of the culture is just awful. It’s just another lender ran by “the good old boys” from the now defunct lenders who created the turmoil of the last lending crisis. The pay was decent but could be better. Benefits were fairly priced. Met many great managers and fellow LO’s and Ops members. Tremendous talent there until the mass layoffs. The good talented people got cut, leaving just the good old boys and their BFF’s like it’s high school all over again. Top performers with stellar quarterly and annual reviews IN writing/documented. ALL gone! If you don’t know mortgage they do have decent training program. I came on as a Senior LO so I didn’t need the training but got to see it firsthand and it’s good. Office is very nice. Modern. HQ has a restaurant inside! Very cool facilities. Coffee is good. That is important too for any hard working LO. Get rid of the toxic old school individuals here and you’ve got a company that will last! Many things could be solved by asking the hard working employees who work there. I’d go back in a heartbeat if the flaws were addressed head first. I truly believe in this company.","Low Comp, Leads aren’t consistent. You can’t go from making $200K to $60K due to lead inconsistency. Don’t blame the market because I’m referencing the time before rates went up.

Upper Management is aged out, stuck in their old toxic ways. Too buddy buddy/ high school popularity contest nonsense. Trim the true fat. Them! Stop laying off all the talented folks who have given years of hard work here. Give both the LO and Processors more control over their files. Then you’ll stop the crazy fallout! Listen to your employees from the bottom up. Less micromanagement of preforming employees. It’s counterproductive to many. The company gave up too quick, too easily just to keep stockholders happy. Mass layoffs could’ve been avoided and done more strategically. Stop lying to the media and fess up on layoffs. Soon you will need quality employees again and a lot of those same people who were displaced by the mass layoff will still be looking for a job while you do not have enough individuals to run the business.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place,1.0,"Jun 23, 2015","The company is growing out of control, the amount of work that it's creating for itself means that there will always be insufficient staffing, and therefore you will always be tasked with learning a new skill because no one else will be put into the position that actually handles those tasks.","Where do I start? This company's projections are irrational. They are biting off more than they can chew, stressing out employees and every single department. They are lacking in infrastructure, aside for being understaffed and having the feel of a sweatshop. You get 10 vacation days per year, which you have to accumulate. Also the case with sick time, you accumulate 4 hours per month. Things here are grim on every perspective. starting with lack of parking spots, (translating into having to walk from a different company's parking lot on a different street for 10 minutes until you get to your building), continued with the crowded work environment (which is often so loud you can't actually focus on work) to the poor computing technology that hardly supports the tasks needed to be done on a regular basis. The absolute worst of this company is that management is severely lacking in leadership skills. often managers will not acknowledge their employees or even realize how knowledgeable and experienced they are. Career pathing is formally not on the agenda. nepotism rages out of control. You will most likely not get a raise, ever. I have seen people get promoted 2 or 3 times, without getting a raise, with the title change being delayed up to 3 months, and taking on additional responsibilities while minimizing their personal life outside of work for the sake of being able to function. HR is a joke, they take forever to handle claims, and in some cases they even drop the ball to a point where medical workers comp claims get denied because they don't provide forms in due time. Executives pretty much will not acknowledge your existence even if you interact with them on a daily basis. Unless a manager need something from you, he will not even say hello. Promotions are often based on veterancy and position availability. most of the time because of the high turnover rate - positions will just become available and it will be cheaper for the company to promote somebody from within without giving them a raise, rather than hiring somebody from the outside and to try and match market salaries.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

"AVOID THIS CUTTHROAT, PRIMADONNA PLACE!! – UNLESS YOU ARE DESPERATE FOR A JOB",1.0,"Jun 8, 2016","I enjoyed working with smart, dynamic people and learning new skills. The cafeteria also served decent food at times. The gym is decent given the size of the room.","I would describe the company culture as being TOXIC at best due to WEAK MANAGEMENT. I had the misfortune of working with managers who were very unapproachable (even narcissistic) and only talked to you when they needed something ASAP (not even a “Good Morning”). In addition, there were many managers who were INCOMPETENT and LACKED FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS to do the job as managed with an “IRON FIST”. Many times, they will take credit for your ideas and work to cover up their own shortcomings. I also felt there was a LACK OF TRANSPARENCY working on projects since I was NOT INVITED TO CRITICAL MEETINGS and UNREALISTIC DEADLINES WERE PROMISED to the stakeholder. To make matters worse, I wasted more time having to re-clarify what deliverables are needed as well as being under intense pressure to get things done. In addition to WEAK MANAGEMENT, I would also describe the atmosphere as being a “SECRET SOCIETY” where privileged people (those that have tight connections as a result of nepotism) are allowed to prosper and surpass me (in terms of growth and future opportunities) after I’ve shared all of my valuable knowledge (which took years to develop) with them. Largely, I felt that whatever significant contributions that I have made to the department go unnoticed by upper management unless one of their “privileged” kids had done it (or stolen credit for it). If you decide to join PennyMac, just know that: 1. The commute is horrible and parking is problematic (no work from options allowed). 2. You will be low-balled on salary. 3. Their health benefits are expensive. 4. It will take a very, very long time to accrue any vacation time. 5. You must wait 1 year after start date before you can enroll in 401k program. 6. No work/life balance. 7. No raises or merit increases or promotions unless the CEO approved it (which can take an eternity – this is where it helps to have “tight connections”). 8. Be prepared to be exploited and/or marginalized. 9. Have headphones on to drown out obnoxious, fake laughs. Do not have headphones on when the CEO is in the vicinity (as this is one of his pet peeves). Although I am grateful for the skills that I’ve learned and for the relationships that I’ve developed there, but if I had a do-over, I would have only USED the PennyMac OFFER letter as LEVERAGE (without any intent of ever joining).",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

People were scrambling to find seats. They just didn't want to give you a 'day off.' - Coworkers are generally pretty unimpressive and one-dimensional. - Mediocre health insurance benefits. - You get half of your bonus every 6 months, so if you need to leave between April and October, you're forfeiting half of your bonus. This is done deliberately to make you stay at the company, or maybe it's another indication of PennyMac nickel and diming literally everything. - No company holiday party, but a couple times a year they bring food trucks and you get to wait in long lines to get a bite to eat and a lukewarm beer. - Extremely steep organization with layers upon layers of middle management.

You're a passionate Engineer? Don't work here. Period.,1.0,"Nov 2, 2014",Great cafeteria options (although a little expensive) Great gym and facilities,"If you're a passionate software or infrastructure engineer, just stay away from this place. Not only is there unnecessary process and office politics at every turn, but you have to deal with bully managers and a systemic toxic culture that leaves no room for work/life balance. And as others have mentioned, you will never get a raise at this place, ever. No bonus for you either, while most managers and executives roll into work in their $60k+ cars and have performance incentives in the form of QUARTERLY bonuses. Engineering is seen as nothing more than overhead and a bottom pyramid servicing department (like is the case with most financial services companies). This means they need you to follow orders, and not ask too many questions. Don't expect to have any freedom at all while writing code, or architecting systems either. They might lead you on to thinking you have control, but you have no authority over projects, yet are expected to be responsible for the outcome. Responsibility and authority are inseparable. This dynamic does inevitably lead to failures, that will hang over your head. Still feel like you wanna give this company a try and see for yourself? Well, you'll be looking at legacy code and poorly documented systems all day and working on a ton of dead end projects. Hard work will earn you no credibility whatsoever. You'll spend hours stuck in meetings and managers will then wonder why you're still debugging. You will then be asked to work weekends because ""things just need to get done around here"". If this is what you want day in and day out, then go for it. They're always hiring Engineers because people keep quitting, so you could very well end up getting an offer fairly quick.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Good luck finding employment with PNMAC on your resume,1.0,"Sep 1, 2021","Well, they have a great sales pitch to reel you in, and they give you a draw so you're not starving at first","I could easily write a 90 page novel here that would have so many details the review would not get approved and so I'm forced to keep it as general as possible since Corporate America rules the country these days. God forbid we have transparency... I'll echo what many have said below: 1) Poor systems - yes, your loan application will take anywhere from 1-4+ hours, and don't complain about the systems, all roads lead to: It's your fault 2) Hours - plan on gaining weight, eating microwave food, never seeing the light of day, and putting family time on hold 3) Plan on having any/all ""concerns"" dismissed by the sociopaths in charge. They've sold their souls, and they expect you to do the same. 4) Without going into detail, if you're a highly ethical/empathetic/caring individual, it's not the place for you to work. You'll continually get to deliver bad news to clients for reasons I cannot discuss here. 5) They put the ""Cult"" in ""Culture"" - So anyone that's caught speaking up, will be tracked down and pulled into meetings; So if you want a taste of what employment might be like in China, or other authoritarian dictatorships, PNMAC is a great place to learn what that's like. 6) Fundings - Anytime you think you're going to have that ""great month"" watch as fulfillment/processing and others that you count on simply disappear at key points in the process, leaving your clients calling you asking why the notary didn't show up. 7) Expect contradictory guidance - at one moment you're told to do X, then plan on being pulled into a meeting for doing too much of X. 8) Watch as people are promoted SOLELY for parroting management. It truly is like High School 9) Plan on having your loans purposefully and strategically delayed so that by the time you DO decide you want out, you'll be forced to walk away from many clients you worked hard at covering up all of the shortcomings of the company and keeping them on board with the process, because you wont' get paid and in fact, PNMAC hires ""special"" bean counters to go through your pipeline to try to reduce any/all income before you leave. They love what they do and will send you condescending emails with voice of resentment, as if it's your fault that the company has made poor choices and you're now leaving. 10) Finale' time!!! Good luck finding employement anywhere else in a direct to consumer MLO role. When recruiters see PennyMac on your resume, you'll be passed up, OR if you do actually go through the long list of reasons why you left, they simply will not believe you and label you as ""jaded."" Recruiters have zero clue as to how tragically poor the operation here is, that they will actually believe you're just making it up. My advice to recruiters: Believe the reviews here. The negative reviews are not simply weak willed individuals whom lacked grit, perseverance and willingness to succeed.

Wolves in Sheeps Clothing,1.0,"May 25, 2022",Pay was decent and overtime was offered when 'they' needed us and WE pulled through for 'them'. I did take away more knowledge in a particular area of mortgage from this job.,"I was laid off 5/9/22. The 'WE' I speak of are the numerous 'bodies/numbers' that handled the load when the market was exploding when covid hit and all the bodies before me that gave their best to PennyMac over the years, namely many veterans, including myself, who were there in the trenches when it counted. Upper management has no idea of key employee contributions and stellar records because they don't care to know. I was under a management team that came to the company connected to each other and used our knowledge and ideas making them their own promising help and support to advance in the company when, in the end, they cut us loose once they had what they needed. No efforts by management to communicate with other managers in the company to move key, talented employees into other areas of interest. They say they will do this but never follow through with the support of their statements that they will do all they can to help you succeed. I felt used in the end and taken advantage of, BUT knew in my heart all along the kind of 'clickish' people I was under anyway. I still showed up to my job each day and proved my worth so felt good having helped 'MY clients' in my role with PennyMac on a personal level. I felt sad when I was laid off, BUT also felt a weight of lies and deceipt lifted off my life of which I am the wiser for. You always hear of large companies in this manner. ""It's corporate America, they (the big fishes) are all about revenue never thinking of the LOYAL LITTLE FISHES that are helping them swimming in the trenches, taking care of the customers each day going above and beyond."" From the biggest fishes (upper management) down to lower management, unless you fit their idea of staying a subservient employee ALWAYS, never having a desire to advance your career, you will lose in the end with PennyMac. Save yourself the trouble and STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY! OR, take advantage of learning 1 thing really well expecting once you do, you will be ready to move on to another company cause' this one does not have an interest in paying you your worth in the end. I believe one of the reasons PennyMac is set up the way it is, namely people working only 1 specific area of the loan process is to keep them hungry for more knowledge and leaving them trapped with expertise only in only one skill set as many they hire don't have broad experience in the mortgage industry. They can't have people learning and knowing too much because it's NOT this companies practice to advance people in their careers and PAY THEM MORE MONEY. This is truly a revolving door company where advancement is not based on merit. I saw MANY talented AND CLASSY people leave the company on their own, wise to this practice, before lay offs and even after the first round of layoffs. I happened to be laid off in the second round having top production numbers for 2 and 1/2 years while having the best record of helping loans to close on time, etc.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Right before the pandemic, any managers with employees working under them were pulled into a meeting, not shockingly, most of them were men. When they returned, they gathered around near my desk and joked and laughed at a mandate to hire more women. My manager turned to me, and said, “yeah, I was pretty much told I HAD to hire you because you were female.” Another incident with an MD, reviewing presentation materials with my group. It was stressed that everything needed to be perfect, to which the male MD turned and looked at me (the only female in the room), and said, “well that’s why she’s here. To make things pretty.” I also witnessed my male colleague, hired at the same time as me, get one on one training on a daily basis. I was never afforded the same, and in fact, when I asked questions I was treated like I was stupid and told to figure it out myself. Not only was he given more training, but also more work to do. There would be hours upon hours that I was given little to no work to do, but he would be kept busy…it was so obvious that the manager in charge of our work actually said to me, “I know I’m giving him all the work right now, but he needs to learn how to use Excel.” So…because he was under qualified he gets all the work? Or is it because Im female and they were trying to squeeze me out? It’s truly a wonder they haven’t seen sued.

There were times when people at adjacent desks would be supposedly working on important projects and I would hear nothing but whispering and giggling (not exaggerating here) or in some cases loud talking and flirting for 10, 15, and 20 minutes at a time as I was working my hardest during a very busy day. I eventually invested in some earbuds. Also, I witnessed cases of well-connected people getting picked for promotions over those who were clearly superior candidates in terms of tenure and performance. I noticed that (shocker) young entry-level people whose parents or family members worked at the company or BoA/CW managed to move out of the trenches and into much better positions with the most incredible speed. The Moorpark location is a long drive from most parts of L.A. It is actually in a business park on the outskirts of town which is even worse because you have to drive 5-10 minutes into town if you want to eat somewhere other than the company cafeteria. It was announced to us that everyone in the company would lose one of their discretionary days but the exact explanation given was that both discretionary days were to be replaced with a single ""religious freedom"" day. Interesting. Around the same time, the company became much more aggressive about hiring many more new workers as temps and also keeping them at temp status for as long as possible. Many temps (I was not a temp) of over 6 months tenure who had proven themselves to be solid employees were still being denied conversion to full employee status (and therefore all benefits). Given what I know and what I've heard about the history of Countrywide and Kurland's involvement in it, I probably should have come in with lower expectations.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Crazy Metrics High turn over,1.0,"May 11, 2021",Cool colleagues. Clean bathrooms. Good training.,"One of the highest turnovers in the industry. I think their goal is to have a high turnover so you work yourself to death trying to meet their metrics only to get fired or resign and walk away from your pipeline so they don't have to pay you. Terrible upper management who puts pressure on lower management and in turn all others suffer. Unattainable metrics (everyone has had a write-up at some point at this company). As your call #'s go up, your call-to-app will go down because it's impossible to do an application on people who were transferred to you who have no intention of refinancing. As your call-to-app goes down, you will receive a write-up. If you increase the number of applications you take to increase those numbers (doing applications on people who you know the loan won't close), your call to app will go up but your app to funding will go down. Micromanaged to death. No work-life balance. I have a friend who still works there. He is in the top 15 Loan Officers by funding and currently has a write-up. He has to hear his manager complain on a daily basis about his call volume. Nothing anyone does is good enough at this company. They care more about metrics than the bottom line. This goes to show, even if your end goal is to close many loans, you still aren't good enough. Their goal is to get you to meet their metrics, not close loans. While I was there (one of the only females), I had a perverted manager who always stood really close and when I was sitting down he'd lunge his crotch in my face when my head was at his waist level.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm
