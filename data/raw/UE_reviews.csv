4.0,"Mar 23, 2019","This company is a challenge, and if you meet that challenge head on and give them 110% of your effort you will be rewarded. We are extremely tech savvy, implementing software and efficiencies on a regular basis to keep up with the times. If you don't know excel and aren't good with adapting to change then this is not the company for you. Senior management is demanding, and most likely know the answer before they even ask you the question, which only challenges you to be on top of your game at a moments notice. I am putting this in the pros section, because I firmly believe it has made me a better/stronger/efficient employee. With regards to the comments in other reviews about Vornado employees getting fired/let go... from what I have witnessed, they weren't making the cut because most of them were unwilling to accept the changes that the company needed to make in order to complete in the retail market, so I wouldn't read to far into that. As long as you don't abuse it, they are flexible with you working from home when needed (kids sick/doctors appointment/etc.)",- Health insurance could be better. - Work/Life balance isn't always high priority among senior management - overtime during busy times is expected - overloaded with work at times.,Company that challenges you everyday,Urban Edge Properties,UE,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Urban-Edge-Properties-Reviews-E1266179.htm
2.0,"May 5, 2017",Good medical plans and 401K matching but that is due to the shared agreement with Vornado. Once that expires everything will be different.,The bulk of the leadership team is comprised of deceiving and selfish people. Vornado employees would transferred to Urban Edge have slowly been fired since the company spun off in 2015. Replaced by less expensive younger people (smells like a class action lawsuit). In particular the finance group happens to be the worst department at Urban Edge. The CAO is a terrible leader who blindly promotes only her cohort of former Deloitte friends and the CFO will sell you out to save a penny. I would avoid working at this company.,Stay Away,Urban Edge Properties,UE,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Urban-Edge-Properties-Reviews-E1266179.htm
1.0,"Apr 13, 2016",There are no pros working for this company.,"CAO, CEO and CFO are very deceiving. Vornado Realty Trust formed (spun off) Urban Edge and 80 employees were transferred of which 15 have been fired within the past 4 months and they were told the company is reorganizing. PLEASE DO NOT WORK FOR URBAN PROPERTIES.
