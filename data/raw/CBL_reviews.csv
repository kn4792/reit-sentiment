This is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.,5.0,"Jan 21, 2025","Here’s the updated review incorporating your new points: 5 Stars - The Best Employer I’ve Worked For Starting with CBL 9 months ago has been one of the best career decisions I’ve ever made. After 22 years in the industry and working with countless management companies (many of which left much to be desired), I was blown away by how different CBL truly is. Their vetting process was extensive and, though it was intense, you could tell they were on the right path and committed to finding the best fit for their team. From the very beginning, it was clear that they take the time to know their people and ensure they’re making the right decisions for both the company and the employee. From day one, CBL has exceeded my expectations. The interviews were engaging and professional, and it was apparent they do things the right way. Their commitment to excellence shines in every aspect of the organization, from onboarding to competitive pay and generous benefits. At the same time, CBL expects the same level of dedication and work ethic from its employees. But that’s easy to deliver when you work for a company that genuinely supports you, values your input, and stands behind your decisions. The work is challenging—this is not a company for slackers—but it’s rewarding. About a month ago, when the mall I worked at went on the market and was sold, I was initially devastated. Typically, when a mall changes ownership, the staff either transitions to the new owners or is left in a precarious position. After only 8 months in my role, I feared losing CBL as my employer. However, I reached out to HR to express my interest in staying with the company, and to my surprise and gratitude, they went above and beyond to retain me. Despite being new, they recognized my situation and offered to transfer me to a mall in another state. This level of care and support is something I’ve never experienced with a management company. The benefits CBL provides are incredible—almost entirely employer-paid, generous paid time off, and an exceptional work-life balance. The management team is phenomenal, with centuries of combined experience, and my boss is hands-down amazing. The pay is on the higher end of the spectrum, if not the highest, and everyone I’ve worked with LOVES this company. It’s no wonder employees stay for 20+ years. In fact, I’ve heard of many who left to try other companies, only to return months later because the grass is simply not greener on the other side. This review is completely unsolicited—I’m writing it because I feel compelled to share how great this company is. If you are top talent, this is a company you must work for. As long as you do your job, they will always show up with your check and have your back. CBL is, without a doubt, the best company I’ve worked for. I trust and value my coworkers implicitly—they’re not only great people but also immensely talented in their fields. I couldn’t ask for a better employer or a better team.",None-- and I love to complain,CBL Properties,CBL,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CBL-and-Associates-Properties-Reviews-E2378.htm

There are distinct cliques and ""favorites"" and a resistance to inclusion on many levels. I was actually at meetings where there was not a single female speaker featured and there was an exceptional celebration of sports coaches from Utah and of sports in general (I don't mind sports, but when that is ALL that is featured, it gets old). They will tout how important family is, however, they have no compunction about forcing work/travel on weekends without giving any comp time in exchange, which is just silly. I truly feel that the only reason one of the larger developers haven't done a take over of this company is that it would be too much work to sell the 50 ugly properties in order to secure the 15 solid ones and the 25 so-so ones. The IT department has a stranglehold and will actually actively discourage or tell VP level managers no to simple requests because they are quite convinced that they'll be hacked.
