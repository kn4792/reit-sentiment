Overall great company to work for,4.0,"Jan 20, 2025","Great work
Open door policy",Difficult to get a decent pay raise,RLJ Lodging Trust,RLJ,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/RLJ-Lodging-Trust-Reviews-E7308275.htm
Adult Daycare,2.0,"Apr 16, 2025","Reasonable hours, no health insurance premiums, monthly catered lunch","I've never felt so infantilized before in a workplace. Expectations include sitting at your desk with nothing to do and waiting for hours on end for a menial assignment from senior management. Independent work does not exist. Visibility is more highly valued than efficiency and information is heavily siloed between groups. I was actively discouraged by my manager from making suggestions or forming professional connections with employees on other teams. More than 20 employees left in 2024, and in the past three weeks both the CFO and General Counsel have resigned.",RLJ Lodging Trust,RLJ,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/RLJ-Lodging-Trust-Reviews-E7308275.htm
Tyrannical Organization,1.0,"Mar 1, 2025",Excellent access to real estate and the hospitality industry as a whole.,"Leslie D Hale (CEO) has created an environment where workers are scared of her. Just last year, she publicly humiliated a junior analyst. She threatened to fire this individual in front of many people on staff, and although things cooled down, the individual went right back to work. No public statement from HR or the CEO was made regarding the incident. The incident made many uncomfortable however, as almost 20 people left the organization following the incident in 2024. This was just one example of the CEO’s ongoing abusive behavior to the workers.",RLJ Lodging Trust,RLJ,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/RLJ-Lodging-Trust-Reviews-E7308275.htm
Toxic Work Culture and Lack of Growth Opportunities,1.0,"Feb 6, 2025","The company offers valuable industry experience and exposure to high-level projects, which can be beneficial for career development.","Unfortunately , this company does not prioritize employee well-being. Workloads are excessive, and raises are infrequent despite increased responsibilities. Leadership, particularly CEO Leslie Hale fosters a challenging work environment that lacks support and transparency. The company culture feels toxic, with limited opportunities for professional growth or recognition.",RLJ Lodging Trust,RLJ,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/RLJ-Lodging-Trust-Reviews-E7308275.htm
