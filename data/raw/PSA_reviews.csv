Not worth it.,2.0,"Oct 20, 2025","Pros: • The pay is okay for what it is, though it doesn’t feel like enough for everything you deal with • The schedule is predictable, which makes it easy to plan your week • You usually work alone, so there’s some independence","Cons: • There’s a constant push to make sales, but you don’t see any personal reward or commission for it • Motivation from management feels forced — it’s more about driving company profits than genuinely helping customers • Customers are treated like dollar signs, and employees eventually start to feel the same way • It feels less like being a property manager and more like working in a call center • Higher-ups seem to spend more time watching cameras than spending time with their families or supporting their teams • The push to constantly ask customers for 5-star reviews feels fake and unauthentic • If you get hurt or have any issues, it’s brushed off or met with sarcasm instead of care • The work environment feels unprofessional and disconnected, with little real concern for employee well-being • The job can be slow, repetitive, and mentally draining • Overall, it feels like the company cares more about appearances and metrics than the people keeping things running",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
Toxic work environment and lack of respect for employees,1.0,"Nov 16, 2025","They hire quickly and the recruitment process is very fast. The interviews are smooth, and they offer opportunities for people with customer service experience.","The training process was unprofessional and abusive. I was assigned to different properties with no proper guidance and asked to clean entire buildings instead of being trained for customer service tasks. Some managers constantly disrespected me, mocked my English accent, and left me alone without support. I witnessed bullying, unsanitary conditions, and a complete lack of empathy from supervisors. When I reported issues to the district manager, no action was taken — instead, I was blamed. The workload was excessive, the environment toxic, and I was treated like a cleaner, not as a Customer Service Self storage manager in training.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
Toxic. Deceptive.,1.0,"Jul 14, 2025",Maternity leave. 2 supportive supervisors. Work from home.,"Low pay. Low commission. Toxic environment. Angry customers. Working weekends and holidays. No quality of life or work-life balance. Monotonous heavy workload. System issues affect income. Company does not care about its hardest working department, that is sales. Upper management keeps increasing our sales metrics without a pay raise. The Call Center production average used to be 28% back in 2022, now the expectation is 36% with most agents topping 40%. The company has become an evil version of itself by becoming greedier and greedier since Covid. They’ve hired overseas employees who they can pay lower wages but the US customers hate speaking to the overseas workers. Customer care is atrocious, I’ve never seen a company mistreat their customers the way Public Storage does. They raise the rent on customers frequently, and customers can never reach an in-office staff member for any assistance. Sales has to take the heat of all of its angry customers due to the lack of staff at the properties. Upper management is too micro-manage-y with constant fear mongering of termination. 4 supervisors were just terminated and overseas has the majority of managers now. Upper management has been promising the sales department “shift bids” for over 3 years with no intention of ever letting any sales employee have the opportunity to change their shift to better their quality of life. They’re just dangling the carrot as a tactic to lessen their high turnover. Unkept promises. As of July 1st, they only allow 8 call outs per year. Sales employees call out due to strenuous work schedules, and high burn out. Be prepared to call out sick when you need to take a rest from the toxic mental workload.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

The apartment is the only benefit,1.0,"May 26, 2025","If you’re lucky you can get an apartment for free. No micromanaging, you’re by yourself at properties and as long as you have good time management skills you’re fine.","However the apartment attaches you to the job and makes it very hard to leave unless you have an alternative living situation, or financially can afford to leave. I used to love my job but recently they started having managers going to two properties in one day, but also mandate you take a lunch so you essentially have 3.5 hours at each property but they want you to still get 8 hours of work done at each property. They have been complaining the properties aren’t up to cleanliness standards but refuse to acknowledge that we don’t have the time to do everything we need. There is no work life balance because you’re expected to be there 8 1/2 hours five days a week… 9:30-6 Monday - Friday and 9:30-5 on weekends. They do not close early for ANY holiday, they close for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day that’s it. They have been getting rid of golf carts throughout the company making it harder for managers to get things done. There is no accountability when people don’t do their jobs, it gets pushed under the rug. They don’t want us to tell customers information about why the office is closed, and they keep giving customers ridiculous rent increases, but assume we can keep the customer even tho it’s their business practices driving them to the competition… also since we’re barely interacting with them we never know if they’re vacating to keep them as a customer. As an employee if you need a storage unit you get treated like every other customer, no employee discount, no free unit and no special privileges and they pay us on the day the late fee hits, when this was brought up to management we were told to pay early with the second pay check in the month. There’s so much more I could go on, but honestly his job is not what it used to be… we’re just overworked bees making the queen richer and richer with nothing to show for ourselves.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
What a joke and a big waste of your time if you're smart.,1.0,"May 23, 2025",Not much pros here maybe you might meet a few cool people if you're lucky but company-wise and pay wise culture wise no pros only cons.,"For someone such as myself who's had a perfect record with zero write-ups and an overachiever and a circle of excellence winner...... So hear me out and yes I was fired recently for something absolutely absurd that could have easily been solved with a write-up instead but the reason why they fired me is because I kept on pushing and requesting information about pay raises and why after two and a half years and winning awards how come I haven't received one and what is the criteria for a potential raise and how can I improve and why would this be a subject that cannot be answered I had to have blown my mind trying to figure this out for a long time with this company. I've tried and tried and emailed different channels in corporate and everyone ignores you when you ask about money what a damn shame. Let me first start off by saying this, It's all about the shareholders from the top round table and it trickles all the way to the DMs and it stops there. Beware. It's a damn shame but this company loves to boast and brag about how it's one of the best places to work but they don't want to pay their employees nearly what they should be paying them. They damn sure take advantage of you especially if you're a hard worker. . Be ready to be discriminated on and used and abused and taken advantage of while the CEO soaks in 8 to 10 million per year salary. They don't care about their tenants and I have many stories to prove this, long story short it doesn't matter if you're in the ICU on your deathbed they will sell your stuff it doesn't matter if you have cancer and have survived it three times and literally just got out of a hospital from surgery they will sell your stuff it doesn't matter if you have 50 cents left on your balance they will sell your stuff zero morals. This company has come a long way from it's original roots in which were genuine and honest. But over the years, public storage has transformed into a political monopoly ran by money hungry corporate blue collar folks that have designed the framework to load their pockets with so much money they don't know what to do with it . So rich they become greedy and they will probably never take care of their employees and pay them and treat them the way they should be. Lots of favoritism as well, DMs usually only care about one thing...... getting their bonus! As a manager it's sad to say but it doesn't matter how many work orders you put in or how many times you try to get something repaired or fixed on the property they just don't want to spend any money to the point where you end up doing it your damn self and that's pathetic. This company will use you up and then the moment you try to defend yourself or start asking valid questions that deserve valid answers, they will frown upon that avoid it at all costs and then hang you up to dry The very first chance they get whether it's on a technicality or anything just so they don't have to talk about it. I used to say I loved my job but once I uncovered the truth...I realized quickly this company is a scumbag company. Oh yeah and if you're a hard worker and you think that reaching out to a corporate employee will do you any good we'll think again because all they do is ignore you .... They don't give two ""you know what's"" about property managers as we are the scum of the company and they don't care about our opinions nor do they care about our living situations or our well-being there is no culture here and there is no appreciation and there's no money. I've worked a lot of companies and I've always given it my 110 if not more percent effort and still to this day I do the same because I won't let any company change who I am in the way I perform I do a great job for myself and my self only but I can tell you that this company does not deserve people like me.

The DM I had made it difficult to have a work life balance because they could not get a set schedule in, Sometimes it would get published a couple days before the next week is about to start. They also would not respect the time off people have submitted whether it was put in weeks or months in advance. Like I said, choose this job wisely.

Rewarding Career and Room For Advancement,5.0,"Oct 25, 2018","Public Storage is a great company from top to bottom. The company is hands down the industry leader and has great systems in place to develop junior leaders. Hourly associates are taught how to run a business and are given real authority to impact customer service and grow the business. District Managers take over established systems for existing and newly created districts that give them the freedom to plan/adjust/react with enough structure to keep them on the right path. Employee development is is a priority at all levels and each individual is given the opportunity to progress. Many District Mangers find the DM role to be 100% fulfilling and there are ample opportunities to promote for high performers. I was able to go from brand new District Manager in training to Regional Vice President in less than four years. Public Storage does a great job of giving its leaders---at all levels-- the flexibility to control calendars, develop their teams and achieve results. I would strongly recommend Public Storage to anyone who is highly motivated and wants to be a part of world wide industry leader with a proven record of success.",Not a lot of Cons caused by the company.

That is basically it. No part of working here is enjoyable.,"RUN FROM THIS JOB unless you have no other prospects. You will not have any work life balance. They sell you on banker hours in the interview process, but once hired a 70 hour minimum is required which include nights and ALL weekends. There is consistent change on what the DMs have to focus on which boil down to who can steal from the customers most to achieve an unrealistic goal. You will become a direct customer service agent who handles all customer service calls which normally would be fielded to a corporate office number. As the DM you may have a customer call the customer service number at 3am because they are locked behind a property gate. As a DM you will be expected to go at 3am and let them out! Regardless if it jeopardizes your safety or not. I read across the reviews on here before accepting a position with public storage thinking it can't be that bad. WELL IT IS!!!! RUN!!!!

The company put a hold on all repairs at properties. Slowly the properties are getting run down. I was even told to do an unsafe act because the company was not willing to pay a vendor to come out to do a 5 minute repair job. Upper Management is micromanaging every thing. It became confusing as to what our focus should be. There are no career advancement possibilities for property managers. No matter how good you are, you will never move up.

I have no idea what people are talking about in regards to advancement. Basically you can become a trainer which gets you peanuts as compensation. That's it. You go no further. District mangers are recruited from outside of the company. Takes them a year to learn the business. By then they are either fired or they are running fast to another job.

They take the funds out of your paycheck sure it only comes to $300/mo which is cheap but they advertise as free and that is NOT the case.

The District Manager position is not what it seems- stay away!,2.0,"Jul 17, 2019",Public Storage hires from retail so the work life balance is definitely better.,"You’re essentially a glorified General Manager who oversees multiple properties. Compensation is low at both the DM and property manager level. The company pays their property teams minimum wage and expects way too much for the pay. If you get promoted out of the DM position, don’t expect extra compensation for your new role. Turnover is very high and it’s because the competition is paying much more. You’ll spend a bulk of your month cutting locks and selling auction units. The company does not provide you with protective clothing for the lock cuts either...if you want something more than gloves and goggles you have to pay for it out of pocket; which I’m sure goes against OSHA standards. Benefits are very expensive for not the best coverage. Also, as a district manager you are responsible for working with vendors to get repairs done in your buildings. This takes up a ton of your time and doesn’t allow you to coach and develop your team.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Even the paranoid can't stand this place. Nearly all employees are consistently looking for another job to find a way out. He also has a short-term view of the business and does not believe in customer service, he only wants decisions made that affect the quarterly results he has to present to Wall Street. Read the customer reviews on Google and you will see what I mean. Even the positive reviews were received through a forced solicitation. In the CEO's own words, ""We puke cash"", yet even though they had record breaking YOY improvement, salaries and hourly wages are the lowest in the industry and increases are often put off for several months.

Again not something that you will take pride in. - As a property manager, you will repeatedly find yourself in situations that make you wonder why you aren't paid more. - Depending on the property you oversee, and your relief managers it can feel overwhelming at times. - In my opinion, you are not paid enough for the sheer breadth of work that you have to stay on top of.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

If you want to work here you better be comfortable using scripts for every potential customer encounter, which made me personally feel like some corporate stooge, idiot robot.

Property Managers are not paid anywhere near their value (and are actually paid less than the industry standard), and they are constantly pushed to achieve unattainable goals and are treated with hostility, they are often questioned and reprimanded just because they are not well liked, and are treated like the obstacle to the company's success rather than trained and developed and incentivized.

My own manager was very uplifting to people's efforts, and provided a supportive atmosphere and praised achievements. The computer system is fair to use and learn, and a lot of it is linear in use during tasks. Another pro is that some workers get to live in near or an attached apartment to storage offices.

Management does have certain numbers to achieve, some of the facilities could use more resources or upgrades to tech or physical items. It can be tough to man the office and the grounds in inclement weather, such as heavy snow or ice, since checking each unit is locked is still required.

The vacation time has also changed, many companies have a limit to the hours you can accrue, but PS come November will cash out your hours in excess of 40 hours with the fraise ""Just In Time For The Holiday's"".

You never know what you will be working from week to week. Lots of work and no consideration for a family. The buildings are falling apart and camera don't work. Never get recognized for anything you do. They always want more and more. They don't care about there employees because you can be replaced. If your a big boss like DM etc. Then you get great pay and weekends off. Always getting harassed by the customers. I personally have been threatened at least once a week. They don't care. In the end everything falls on your plate. I have never worked for a company that is so heartless. This is a temporary job. Don't get trapped. They make it sound good but everyone is a manager and there higher ups are from outside never within the company. So no chance to move up. If you love your family and don't want to get treated like crap on there shoe don't work here. Lots and lots of work for little pay. You must sale merchandise and push it on customers or get in trouble. They are all about money not customer service.

Great job for college students and kids living at home with their parents.,Certain DM's are rude and disrespectful. The workload to pay ratio is absurd. Managers are more and more expected to do what DM's used to do. Yet there is not compensation for this. PM's are not able to reprimand RF's when they are not doing there job. Manager's are constantly bickering and gossiping creating an unpleasant work environment. DM's need to be #1 clouds their judgement and causes them to stress out managers even when managers do meet the numbers it is never enough. Young managers come to work with the expectation they will just sit in the office on their phones all day.

Apparently the corporate office doesn't believe that there is a recession. You must sell a lock and insurance and set people up with Auto Pay when they rent whether they want it or not. We have a new contest running right now where the district manager and the regional manager get a trip to Hawai and the property managers who do all the work get a $100.00. Just think about that, you do all the work and get $100.00 bucks and your boss and his boss go to Hawai!

I only worked for the company for 2 months but it became very clear that there was a great deal of disrespect amongst the employees. District meetings were thick with tension and the gossip that occurred on a daily basis was amazing. My property manager would actually have 2 phones on speaker (2 different stores) so they could sit and gossip. There truly is no ""team"" within this company. It is all about the money and no concern for the employees. Throwing one another ""under the bus"" seems to be a very active sport at this company. Also the inability to take responsiblity for one's behavior is very prevelant. There is nowhere to eat lunch - maybe a broom closet with a microwave if you are lucky. Other than that, one must eat in his/her vehicle or go to a restaurant. During the summer months, the air conditioner stopped working - the district manager decided not to fix it because of cost and that he considered it the employees' fault that it was not working. at times the office was close to 90 degrees!!",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

The pay is terrible and anyone with a positive review on here is either higher management or were told to write a good review by HR. You will be unhappy and ruin your life here. You will have to learn 10 scripts and get written up if you're not selling enough locks or insurance. They expect 85% locks and insurance but again we do not get any bonus or incentive on it.

The pay for this job is WAY under What it should be, and vacation time is never going to happen, between black out dates and having to have it manitary that you are here the last day of the month and the 1st day!

For example there are times when you have to deal with disrespectful tenants or rude customers so it is important to stay calm and try to fix the situation. Another con is that there is not much room to advance in the company. You are either a relief manager or a property manager.

Great company to work for!,5.0,"Oct 27, 2016",This company is a hidden gem. Who knew storage can create fantastic careers in management? Public Storage is a great place to work at all levels. The senior management team is extremely supportive and personable. This is an very stable and successful corporation with great values. It is great to see our President and VPs in the field building rapport and getting feedback from the team to create a supportive and positive working environment. You can feel the pride and energy from people who work here at all levels. The company is growing and there are a lot of opportunities to move up to the next level. I'm glad I found Public Storage where I can continue to grow and be part of a successful and profitable team.,The only downside is that very few people know about the positives of working for this company!

District Manager,1.0,"Jul 17, 2017","If one comes from a retail background, the majority of weekends off and the ability to take time off around Thanksgiving and Christmas are nice perks.","One will perpetually be yelled at by customers, since the District Manager becomes the first line of defense for every upset customer in the district. You will have to work in the elements, as cutting locks in the heat of the summer/cold of the winter and running auctions in the torrential downpours is a regular portion of the job. There is nearly zero ability to innovate or think critically, as every aspect of the job is process oriented and one, therefore, merely becomes focused on endless tasks. If I had to guess, the company advertises the salary on each job posting because they would not get any applications for the position otherwise, and certainly wouldn't be able to retain good people if it did not pay better than many from the retail background - from which they recruit - are used to being compensated.

The ability to grow and create your promotional opportunity through hard work and performance is at your fingertips! All promotions after the DM level are internal and the next step, Senior District Manager, is yet another opportunity to grow!",The biggest con is that some DMs don’t see their own potential.

I love that this position gives me such a great work life balance- I am a full-time working mom with 2 young kids and I love that my mornings and evenings can be dedicated to them without work distractions. This is not your typical retail position of opening super early and closing super late and being slammed and busy during holidays. We are open from 9:30 am to 6pm on weekdays and 9:30am to 5pm on Weekends and holidays are our slower times so we have more family time.

The amount of responsibility and stress for the pay is not worth it. Plus they've been putting me at properties that are not even close to where I live, I can think of at least 5 properties that are closer to me than the one I'm working at now. My DM just got fired for being so much of a jerk to his employees and not listening, which is the norm for PS DMs. The pay and bonuses (which change and get less every year) are just completely not worth it.

Great company; even greater people.,5.0,"Nov 7, 2014","First, the company is solid. It’s the undisputed leader in the industry with a good business model and a strong balance sheet – it’s not going anywhere but up. The compensation is more than fair and there are the usual vacation and insurance benefits many companies offer these days. But it’s the intangibles that really make a difference. There’s a genuine passion to help employees develop and grow as professionals. And with the breadth of knowledge available in this office, you are limited only by your own ambition. The environment is friendly and casual, with no ivory towers or executive washrooms. Even the highest-level executives are approachable and willing to listen to new ideas from anyone. It’s a refreshingly open-minded culture for a company this large – and probably one of the greatest reasons for our continued success.",There’s a lack of system redundancies in some areas that can cause pinch-points if a process fails.

Employees are very smart and hard working.,"CEO only thinks of the bottom line to the detriment of Public Storage's employees and customers. For instance, starting 2014, corporate employees' 10 days of sick time was effectively eliminated and, for some employees, their vacation time reduced. We now have a reduced pool of ""paid time off"" so if you take a sick day, you take what was previously your vacation time. Raises are rarely and minimally granted, even though the company is doing very well. CEO's mantra for the customer is ""no pay, no stay"" putting the field in a very difficult position when dealing with their customers. The field has very little flexibility to work with customers, which makes it hard for them to deliver any real customer service. Though the CEO surrounds himself with some extremely smart senior management, he doesn't listen to them and will make decisions against their advice.

Work hours are 8AM-5PM with minimal overtime required. Great work environment with people who actually love their jobs. Most of the people that I work with have been here for 20+ years. I think the reason Public Storage has such a low turn-over rate is because they really focus on the little things. They provide us with bagels every Friday and even have raffles with cash prizes at our monthly meetings. Although these things seem really simple they help keep up the morale in the office.,The pay is good but could be more competitive.

As far as the actual position, you are given a lot of autonomy to run your own District, but you will never be sitting around looking at your watch. There is a lot of variety of work, and if you are the type of person who likes to get outside then you will be thankful that you aren't stuck in a cubicle 24/7.

Coaching and developing people at the property level will help you set your team apart from other Districts. You also work as a team with other Districts and the attitude is helpful and competitive, but not when it's at detriment to the company.

There is no ""better than you"" upper managers that I have met. I can walk over to someone in real-estate and they are happy to talk about how they help make the business run.

Really there are no pros.,"No respect, no support, micromanagement and business model that should be simple is made complicated. Upper management believes in pain management they inflict pain to change behaviors. They want you to inflict pain on the property managers to the change behavior. Upper management sees no value in property managers and will not promote them. District managers are seen as a means to an end and turnover so quickly.

Property Manager,4.0,"Oct 13, 2015",When I started the use of the apartment was a great perk. It presented me with my first opportunity to live on my own and I found the independence very satisfying. I had a great district manager and good co-workers which made the job enjoyable. For the most part you work alone and are able to plan your day around helping your customers. There was a focus on sales (more on that in a minute) of their packing supplies which were over priced but still sold at a decent rate due to the convenience. Stores close by 6pm so no late nights. For a retail type environment this was a big plus.,"While the apartment started off great it later became a shackle that I felt kept me tied to the job longer than I would have liked. Once I met my girlfriend and we started a family the apartment no longer worked for us. The pay increase without the apartment wasn't substantial enough to move out while still working there. If you quite you have something like 3 days to move out of the apartment. So I felt trapped that in a matter of 2 weeks (2 weeks notice) not only would I have had to start a new job but pack my entire home and find a new place to move as well. Ultimately I was able to figure it out and get out of there and I'm glad I did. I've changed companies two times since leaving Public Storage a little over a year ago and I've been able to double my income from changing companies. Another ""Con"" is the sales scripts that they constantly make you role play and secret shop to make sure you are in compliance. Even if you have fantastic sales numbers at your location they expect you to use this robotic, annoying approach to sales which ultimately ends up just irritating the majority of customers. Final ""Con"" and this was the biggest for me. THEY DO NOT PROMOTE FROM WITHIN AT THE STORE LEVEL. This was the main reason I chose to leave the company.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Our DM once told a woman on a conference call he was going to plant his seed in her. And then followed it up moments later by telling her she should strap one on. To be a District manager all you need is a high school degree.....In actuality a DM in this company is the equivalent to an assistant manager at a convenience store with a pair of bolt cutters. I'd like to say something positive about the customer interaction. But honestly they are all liars and scum bags with a seldom encounter with a pleasant individual. Apologies for poor sentence structure or grammar, just buzzed this out to get access. This company should be avoided.

Horrible Company,1.0,"Jan 17, 2018",Some of the best reasons to work at Public Storage is if you like to work alone you got to do that a lot. Also getting to know the customers is also a nice part of the job. And I think that's about it.,So the bad parts to working at Public Storage are the upper management wants you to bust your behind to sell merchandise sell locks and sell insurance to put money in their pockets not ours because they went and took our bonuses away. Also there's no room for growth where you are is basically where you stay. It doesn't matter if you've been there for 20 years or 1 month there's no seniority rules in that place. They do not give raises and if they do it's $0.05 to $0.25 and you have to wait years for that.,Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

"Can be OK for some, but not for me...",3.0,"Feb 25, 2016","You always get a manager title, ragardless, so it does look good on resume. I was able to get a few interviews for solid positions after being able to put ""relief manager"" on there. The pay was $12 in my area, and 10 in most others around my are. It's decent pay for an extra level position. The DM was cool, although company expectations were ridiculous for a non commission job. You could tell he was just doing what he was told and wanted to simply do his part and get his check--I respect that because he did his part well, and I understood where he was coming from when he pushed sales non-stop, or came in in a bad mood.","Well, I'm not entitled person, or someone who expects jobs like these to offer a whole lot; however there were things that even I was very disappointed with. If you are not familiar with what the job entails then you may not understand some of my complaints until you are working there. Firstly, the job is very sales oriented, so much so that you may start to wonder why you aren't getting commission. They do offer bonus's once a year based on performance, but it is tiered, and it does not compensate for lack of a commission structure. The GM will spend his day bugging you about each transaction, and begging you to sell more box's or locks until you feel compelled to cheat customers by charging them without them knowing. All the while you are not being compensated at all for this. There are scripts that they expect you to follow with no room for improvisation. These are some of the most robotic scripts you will ever see, and rely on customers being idiots in order to properly work. Any mistake you make, such as missing an empty unit on your lock check, is dingged and appears as an alert on the company software system, and you are expected to give a full written explanation. Furthermore, the software alert system(and company as a whole) is not employee friendly, it is very customer first type of business, which is fine except for when it is 100% their fault. If a customer leaves a unit without checking out, and they continue to to be charged, it falls on us, and we get an alert, the managers get frustrated and you feel like crap. While I understand we were supposed to do lock checks and catch things like that, it wasn't always so simple on our end. It's too much details to go in a full explanation, but can you just move out of your apartment without telling your landlord? Then get mad because he charges you? On another note, there isn't much room for growth. You can become a property manager, and that comes with a free apartment, but it's on the property, and accepting that position will essentially keep you dependent on the company for more than just work, thus keeping you stuck there, since, how can you beat free housing? overall it is a stressful job and the compensation does not match it. There is a lot of paperwork, you are expected to also make appointment calls, late rent calls, lien calls, and calls to tell people your are selling their belongings because they haven't paid. You will be dealing with a lot of emotional people because, well, YOU'RE SELLING THEIR STUFF! I could go on and on about the position. As A young guy with high aspirations, and wants to move up in this world, I was not excited to wake up for this job. If you're not worried about too much and just need a decent job while in school, then you may not mind it. Or if you're older and just want to make some decent money then may be ok.

"Although my incentive compensation was good, the stress of the job was not worth it.",2.0,"Jul 17, 2014",Good stock incentive program. The potential bonus incentive helps offset the relatively low base pay. I had a good mentor who was in a similar position. Mentoring is a company best practice.,"Poor working conditions, especially for the hourly Property Managers & Assistant Property Managers. Many times they do not get the opportunity to take 10-minute breaks. The company looks the other way in enforcing that employees get to take their breaks. Many of the self-storage properties do not have breakrooms for the employees. In those situations, the employees may have to eat in their cars, or in the office, which can lead to interuptions when a customer knocks on a locked office door. For the salaried multi-unit positions, there is absolutely no work-life balance. They have to work 6-7 days a week and even then, find it difficult to stay caught up. Calls are fielded from customers at all hours (evenings & weekends). The company has a practice of eliminating the bottom 25% of employees at each level in the organization chart. It does not matter if you had a good prior year. Your area could have one bad quarter, and your job is at risk. I had employees threatened by customers and had to work with legal counsel in getting restraining orders. My life was threatened as well by two customers. The self-storage industry is a tough one. As far as Leadership at the company goes, they do maximize the return of the shareholder., but that comes at a cost. Customer service is poor, customers' rate increases are abundant, repairs at the properties are put off and the working conditions are poor.

District Manager,2.0,"Apr 27, 2015",If you really need a job this may be a fit for you. As a district manager you will have limited flexibility in your schedule. The bonus program can be up to 32K per year although it's highly unlikely you will do well for consecutive years in the same market.,"Most companies view their people as the largest asset, not this one. Turnover at the District Manager level and Property Manager position is very high. As a district manager, you will have zero work life balance. You will be micromanaged as if you didn't know the meaning of the word prior. You will have almost no authority to make decisions on behalf of your employees or customers. Goal setting is based on beating the previous year, it's extremely difficult to succeed multiple years in the same territory. District Managers conduct lock cuts, auctions, coordinate repair and maintenance, conduct a large portion of the HR hiring process, handle the majority of customer service issues. You're always on call and your phone can and will be ringing 7 days a week at all hours. The issue being is your compensation and review is tied to sales management in which you have no time for. Probably the worst aspect is the treatment and pay of the property managers.

Been here 20 yrs,5.0,"May 3, 2020","Public Storage supports work/life balance. I have great benefits and don’t work nights. If you get the opportunity to take one of the company apartments, do it! You do get a small decrease in hourly pay but the value of the apartment and utilities far outweighs that. I have been incredibly impressed with the company and their response to the whole Covid 19 craziness. I was just happy to have a job that was not furloughing or laying off but then the company stepped up with childcare/elder care assistance for those who might need it as well as bonus pay. They also went a step further and compiled a list of resources that were available through other sources for parents who suddenly found themselves homeschooling. It wasn’t any thing that cost them money per se but I thought it was nice that they had someone take the time to put all the information in one place just to make life a little easier and less daunting right now.","The cons would be the same as any job where you deal with the public in a customer service capacity. Sometimes tenants want things you can’t do and somehow they blame you. The only con as far as what the company could actually change is there is no way to grow with the company past a certain point.

Will always be grateful to Public Storage,5.0,"Nov 6, 2021","Inclusive hiring Company Apartments - (although these are limited) --with paid utilities! I needed somewhere to literally start my life over and Public Storage gave me that opportunity. I worked for them for about nine years. Great District Managers and Supervisors (almost all of them, anyway)... Pay should be higher--but they would allow overtime in most cases, when you needed it. A lot of times, they needed it, too!","This job is physically demanding--that is, IF you are actually doing your job! Some days I would go home absolutely filthy, dirty--but that was the job! If you are not willing to run/manage the store as well as clean a bunch of very dirty units in the heat or cold--please don't try to work there! Get a job at a bookstore or something. This job is a challenge--if you are actually doing the job. When I was there, some employees were not and the hard-workers had to 'carry' them--which is not cool! Facilities were not maintained well after some years. The company got so large that they took the actual 'management' duties and authority away from the Property Managers--and even District Managers! Things ran a lot smoother when we were given a maintenance budget to stay within and would be trusted to prioritize and keep things in good repair. This also created excellent relationships with vendors (who would do extras for us--just for being loyal to them). Keeping things maintained is MUCH cheaper than having to make huge repairs due to negligence. For the higher managers/supervisors, they company actually incentivized NOT spending money on maintenance and needed repairs! So a lot of times, things just did not get fixed or maintained. After some years, the only person who could actually approve over $100-$200 in repairs knew absolutely nothing about the property or what it needed. This greatly affected customer relations and employee morale. A lot of the needed information about the repair got lost in the translation--which would end up in a wasted vendor trip, etc. ($$). Many repairs did not get done and money was wasted from miscommunication (putting everything into a corporate billing system for someone else to approve--someone who had maybe never even set foot on that property!) This is typical of a lot companies that become very large, though. I call this 'growing pains' and I think a lot of large corporations go through this. This is a great job for those who like to WORK and do their jobs!! If you don't like to 'hustle'...this is not the place for you!

Best company I have ever worked for,5.0,"May 28, 2014","In my experience at PS - the financial payouts are fantastic but that's based on a forced ranking. This allows competitive, solid performers to make very high incomes, average performers to make competitive incomes and poor performers find themselves with lower incomes.

We're very particular about who we hire; we are looking for future leaders and the potential for upward mobility is fantastic for employees that understand how to build high performance teams. A core expectation within the company is to develop people, create a positive working environment and to treat others with respect.

I was always a very entrepreneurial leader in past careers and that approach does not work here; knowing that going into the position made it very easy for me to accept and to embrace that culture.

Senior Management Needs Help,2.0,"Dec 19, 2017","The work life balance is great; weekends off, holidays off. The people in your market are always willing to help each other. Benefits are decent.","The pay is not favorable at any level in the company. Hourly employees and salary employees make little money in comparison to similar jobs within the area. Pay is the same rather you live in the east, west, north, south. (no consideration for the cost of living) The company pays newer district managers more than the current, tenured district managers. Promotions- yes they happen offen, but little to no increase in pay for promotions. Turnover is high for senior level positions; higher turnover the further up the chain one goes. There is very little autonomy to “think like an owner”. The President makes all decisions with minimal if any feedback from the field. A regional manager can’t even hire a district manager, the senior level executives are the one to approve all hires. The senior HR team is more involved in day to day operations instead of building relationships like a normal HR person would be in other company’s.

It's been far too long since they ran their own facility, if they ever did, and all they see now are numbers and how to line their own purses. Mine has extremely poor people handling skills, and will quickly throw a devoted employee under the bus to make them look good and fulfill their own self-serving agenda.

It does not necessarily result in higher pay, but it's nice to be told that you're appreciated, too.","Once you understand the corporate model, it's not so bad. You have to understand that the top level of the corporate chain makes the most money. The bottom, well, doesn't. And yes, they are also very out of touch with our everyday tasks and customer interactions.

Goals are based on things that are out of the managers' control, such as customer behavior, payment history, etc. It's not a job I will be keeping for much longer, but I have been here a few years and I can honestly say that it is the easiest job I've ever had. That being said, the laziness and lack of drive of fellow managers make it difficult to feel like you're better than they are.

Apply with a goal in mind. Get it and get out.,3.0,"Jul 25, 2017","The training is remarkable. The thought and money put into the training video/program production really successfully simplifies the otherwise complex and stressful job requirements into something palatable and doable. There are things that the training doesn't necessarily cover, certainly, but a website has been produced to answer every question a manager could ask and prepares you for anything that could possibly go wrong. Public storage values the self motivated, the level headed, and the socially creative. You will do well if you can shake off problems and focus on the solution. There are many ways that one can take on more responsibility for increased pay if you are willing to work hard. Signing up to be a trainer or patiently waiting for an ""A"" property manager position to open up are two. Competitive personalities will find a home here as your performance is ranked among your peers and bragging rights abound. The hiring process is rigorous and their expectations for your resume are set on a high bar, but there are also a multitude of reasons to push through and stay optimistic through the phone interviews. There are so many things to learn on job because there is so much responsibility placed on your shoulders behind the orange desk. Far from being a downside, this is an exciting opportunity. You will be expected to open and close. Make delinquent/welcoming calls and prove consistent performance in sales. The job of property/relief manager is a strange mix of janitorial, security, and receptionist. Whenever you are ready to move on to bigger and better things, you will be well equipped for almost any change in career or promotion that you set your sights on.","The key phrase is ""move on"". Someday, you will want to and you should not be afraid to give into this urge. The opportunity to learn new things and see yourself ranked in performance among your peers is indeed an exciting one, but don't expect to be well compensated for your efforts. You will be expected to maintain sales quota despite bonus AND commission both having been removed in the last five years, and this year there was no raise at all. Meanwhile, more opportunities for PTO/sick leave were given....In short, Public storage offers more incentives to be absent, than to do the job you are scheduled for. Public storage is obviously not willing to pay a competitive rate for Relief/Property managers OR a sales teammember. Public storage does not allow advancement within the company. They will claim that one only qualifies for the District Manager position if they have District Manager experience--which sounds fair on the surface...the truth is that even if a Property Manager has work or education experience that matches the higher position, they will only be eligible if they first quit and reapply without guarantee that they will have employment at all once they do. Talk about a locked and bolted glass door. Public storage has a lot of issues, the first of which being that property managers within the company make on average $24,000 a year despite the fact that median annual Property Manager salary in USA is $91,114, as of June 28, 2017. This compared to the salary of the most immediate level up--that of district manager---who makes six figures plus bonus. It's a huge gap that represents a serious problem in the company.

Good Starter Job,2.0,"Apr 23, 2019","This position is good for someone who wants a job that isn't fast food or retail. This job has a lot of downtime where you can read a book or play around on your phone. There are benefits like PTO and health insurance. The job is pretty easy and gives you office experience. It looks good on your resume to put that you have experience managing a store, managing accounts, performing rental contracts, maintaining an organized filing system, making collection calls and reservation calls. The biggest perk about the job is, if you are lucky and/or work there long enough, you can get an apartment through them. You don't have to pay rent or utilities, just internet and cable. There are usually only a few in each district, so usually someone has to quit for one to become available, and then it goes by seniority on who gets it next.","There really is no room for growth. From a relief manager, you can move into a property manager role which is the same thing except you work at the same location 5 days a week instead of different locations. They are paid the same and are both thought of as 'managers' of the store. You can move into a trainer position where you make an extra $1.50/hr, and that's it. You will not be promoted in a district manager role, no matter how long you work there. There is no pathway for upward mobility. It really speaks a lot about a company that they would rather take someone new and train them all about the company rather than take someone who has been working there for years and train them on being a district manager. The pay is a joke. Honestly, they want you to perform a bunch of different roles (front desk, janitor, security guard, collections agent) and you get paid about $1 over min wage. If you are lucky enough to get an apartment, it is then really hard to move out. You start to rely on not having to pay rent, and even with the money you save every month, it is still barely enough to live on so it is hard to save up enough money to be able to quit and move out. I know of a lot of people who hated working at PS but weren't able to move out due to the cost of rent and the money they were currently making. Customer service- pretty much enough said. You deal with a lot of difficult people in this position. From making collection calls, to handling people going into auction who are about to lose their stuff, to dealing with homeless people who are illegally sleeping in their unit and having to evict them. You will be cursed out, maybe even threatened (I was). PS also has a no hold policy where even if you make a reservation, you are really only making an appointment, not actually holding the space. We rent on a ""first come first serve"" basis, and I can tell you it really upsets people off when you tell them that they have no guarantee that they will have a space next week when they drive half way across the country.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

I really want to enjoy my job.,2.0,"Dec 15, 2013","My DMs have been very competent, most of my coworkers are amazing people. I've met a lot of new friends, the work is inside and outside, and there's usually some downtime. I live on-site as well, so commute is awesome. It's a nice place.","See the plural up there? I've had three district managers in just over three years. Upper management has become overbearing and callous towards it's employees, DM and property people alike. Low pay, like everyone else has said. Since I live on site, I make 3$ less than my relief managers. Initially my pay was 1.50$ less but then they gave ALL reliefs an extra dollar in hopes it would 'encourage them to do the same amount of work as the property managers'. Add on the .50$ raise for them compared to my .27$ because it was based on a percent rather than work done... there you go. Even then, if something bad happens, it's the property managers fault. For 3$ less - 9.97$ an hour, even. Slow repairs to properties. Lock and insurance! We get written up if our numbers don't go up. I think our locks are pretty heavy duty (I've cut padlocks myself, at my old job) but not for 18$. Insurance IS a requirement but if people lie, we can't refuse to let them rent... even though our numbers go down. Then we get written up. So on and so forth. It murders morale. They've done away with the bonus system entirely save for the 'once a year' thing. I don't consider that a bonus. They word it to sound as if 40% of the company getting bonus is a lot much like in 1984 when they cut rations but made it sound super awesome. It's not. In a company where the smallest property makes in a month what I do in a YEAR... they can afford to give us a bonus, or raise the pay for property managers at least. The scripts aren't so bad. I've been in sales for almost a decade, every place has their scripts. It's a pain to memorize them, yes, but this is the first time I've had eight to twelve different scripts or the requirement to never vary them even if to built a proper rapport. My regular customers have learned that if they come in with other people behind the counter not in uniform that they shouldn't expect me to act myself but rather spout scripts at them. Not learning them earns you a very aggressive talk from the RM and a write up. Also, three write ups in the course of your ENTIRE career there gets you fired without question. If you've been there fifteen years, received one every five... and you're fired. The only reason I'm with the company is because of the apartment and genuinely enjoy my customers - save for the ones I've called the police on. Or the skeevy ones who hit on me and won't let up because 'those security cameras catch everything?' wink wink. I miss feeling respected and valued as an employee.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
$91000 Doesn't Even Begin to Compensate,1.0,"Aug 1, 2014","It seems great. Good pay, hours that are bankers hours with only a Monday-Friday work week. Business casual dress and 2 weeks of PTO your first year. Too bad that's not really all accurate.","Let's be honest. You have multi-unit management experience, you are thinking you want to work for a massive company with growth potential and $75,000 the first year plus a guaranteed $16,000 bonus doesn't sound too bad, right? Wrong. The District Manager position is more like a store manager position anywhere else. You are managing $10 an hour employees and it's 16-25 of them. Most store managers have more direct reports. For this compensation, you are expected to be on call essentially 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Every morning you need to be up and calling each one of your properties to ensure that each of your $10 an hour ""managers"" has shown up for work in a timely manner. If they haven't, you need to notify your Vice President boss and find a way to cover that shift or go to the store and open it yourself. A report comes out daily and goes to everyone from the CEO to the District Manager about what property didn't open on time. If a gate goes down at 9:30 pm and someone is stuck behind, guess who goes? The District Manager. Customer needs in on an emergency after office hours? District Manager. Lock gets stuck on a weekend and it's urgent? Again, District Manager. Someone wants to finally pay their bill before an auction at 6 am? District Manager. During the summers, it's a mandatory 6 day work week, no compensation or additional time off during the week and no option as to which days those will be. You're expected in the field from 8 am to 6 pm and to still find time to accomplish all your own work of doing mindless reports, reviewing numbers that expectations change daily on and managing your team of under-motivated, poorly paid, high school educated employees. The good news? There is no personal growth in this company. The leadership is continuously changing and turnover has become so bad it's now part of the bonus metric. Any District Manager worth his weight can find a better job - the ones that tend to stay have come from companies that are sub-par and aren't able to move forward and advance with another company. Public Storage is where they die. District Managers are only hired from the outside and are never promoted from within - great succession planning right? District Managers are expected to be professional but be on the same comfort level with their hourly managers. Dress code is business casual and is expected even when you are repairing a rolling door, changing a hasp or cutting a lock in 100 plus temperatures or sub-zero ones. There is no quality of life outside this job. If you don't eat, live and breathe Public Storage, you won't make it. It's about basic greed and corporate manipulation. There is no ethical room to even help anyone. it's a bitter end for anyone who can't pay as an auction is conducted regardless of situation. Your job is to say no, I don't care that you have cancer, don't care that you're getting divorced, don't care that you're dying or that you lost your mother - can't pay today, too bad - it's sold. Public Storage likes to say ""We're a compassionate company"" but frankly, we aren't. We are a cut throat, money hungry organization that simply is out to make a buck. We raise your rent - pay or get out. There is no flexibility. My bottom line is that I took this position with another offer on the table. I made the wrong decision. I'm looking now as I'm miserable here and it's a limited market. I've been with 2 big box retailers as a District Manager and never been this micromanaged or abused.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Don't get trapped,2.0,"Aug 5, 2014",I like working alone for the most part. If you're taking night classes slow days are great to get some studying done. Position offers benefits if you can hack it.,"As a Property Manager you have to deal with everything: cleaning, maintenance, customer service; which wouldn't be terrible if the pay was better. Safety is a concern, especially as I had someone who came in repeatedly and threatened me, basically saying she was going to keep coming back until she, ""get[s] what she want[s]."" My DM's position on this was a, ""Sucks for you"" attitude. Same thing goes for when the DM screws up. I had no running water for 2 weeks because someone did not get my backflow inspection done. He ignored notices from the water company for 6 months. Once again, it was a ""Sucks for you"" attitude. I never had 'drinking water' per say to begin with, but then I was without a sink or a toilet. I had to drive to a shopping center to use the restroom. In the meantime my DM called me constantly on the store phone to make sure I was still there and didn't decide to leave without telling him. The company refuses to pay to repair and maintain their properties. I have NO light at my location at night. This has been reported for months, but the company did not like the estimate given by various contractors to repair/replace my lighting. I get to deal with the customer complaints on no lights, holes in buildings, rate increases (which are extreme), and now I'm having health problems (so I'm trapped because this is where I get my benefits) The sales requirements are ridiculous. It is assumed you are not executing the script properly if you fail to sell a $20 lock to every customer. Most of these people rent their trucks from Uhaul. Same locks for $13. It would be nice to get a weekend off every once in awhile without having to fight for it. Only certain employees get all of the days off they want, including 3- and 4-day weekends.

Over The Years..,4.0,"Jun 25, 2015","Longevity is the best way I can start this review as a 12 year vet at this Company. If you are looking to work for a great Company and have the skills, for-sight to work hard and flexibility to change at any given notice. This would be a great work place for anyone who applies these abilities to their work ethic. Starting out at the property level was my introduction to how the PS family operates. I had a large work load and gave my all to provide the best customer service and complete all work duties assigned. As I grew to master these tasks on a daily bases, I also grew stagnant to the limitations I was feeling towards my strengths and abilities. So I decided to put in my two weeks after 2 years of service. Once I advised my GM at the time, she then advised our VP at the time. To my surprise, they both scheduled a meeting a few days later to convenience me not to leave the company. I thought to myself why? They both expressed how much I was an asset to the company with great work ethic and provided such great CS, they could not loose me. So they suggested I try a corporate sales job for 3 days, the following week. If I did not like it, they would honor my resignation, but if I felt the sales position would be a better fit position, I could take the job and extra pay ($) . I tried it for the 3 days and took it! After 4.5 years of sales. I was enjoying the sales and learning development training and of course the pay. But not the complacency took its tool on spirit. My manager at the time put a recommendation in for another positon within the company, as an Assistant Buyer. I applied myself again and took the position to further my PS education. I say education because there is so much to learn and teach in all the fields I have grown in. My years at PS have been awesome and rewarding. The PS family has a special place in my heart and I would recommend anyone to apply themselves to become a part of this family. It’s not easy to go above and beyond for some people, but doing better and thinking ,then re-thinking any positive ways to push yourself forward, will have great rewards. Not just for the company you work for, but to prove to yourself, it’s my responsibility to create your own goals and achievements.

In the same sense, I haven't trained an associate that set out in search of a position with a storage company. All of the people I have connected with here have enriched my life in many valuable ways.","I was hired in and told if I could stand out, proving my abilities to be outstanding, promotions were possible. It didn't take long before I learned that being as I was hired as a Relief Manager in Field Management, no matter what I did I could only advance to a Property Manager, then an A Property Manager, and then finally I could become a Key Training Professional. (Not necessarily in that order) This knowledge didn't stop upper management from misleading me, recommending that I return to school to complete at least my 4 year degree to become eligible for the District Management position, where my career potential would have no boundaries within the company and my salary would more than triple, and the incentive package would put my years salary to shame. Two years into juggling a very chaotic life...promoting all the way through field management, enjoying marriage, raising young adults, accumulating student loans, and constant exhaustion, but maintaining energy through adrenaline, I experienced a new regional who told me flat out that I had reached the top...No matter what I did, I would not be promoted outside of field management. Since that time I've continued to stay. I've been comfortable at times and I do enjoy the job. However, maddeningly every year they find a way to take more away. They took away sick pay, then yearly they reduce Paid Time Off. Now they argue on allowing us to use our earned PTO, and if it isn't used by a certain deadline, they cut us a check instead of allowing us our earned rest/family time. Our bonuses went from monthly to quarterly, then quarterly to yearly. Merit increases are now mass increases, in tiny percentages, provided to all, no matter what your performance level is. Upper management constantly changes now, without ever sharing any of their strategies. The field moral is now nonexistent, they want robots, they demand results, high pressure sales, so we can pad the pockets of our CEO, while our properties run in need of more maintenance and upgrades for our clients who consistently receive rate increases leaving them upset with the office staff who have zero control. Those upset customers then leave, and upper management expects us to explain why we can't retain their business.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

It's all about the people.,5.0,"Apr 17, 2018","Number one PRO - the people and culture. From the Key Training Property Managers who have been with us for 10 years to the Senior Executives of the company- I have not met a leader here who did not show enthusiasm and dedication for both our customers and our fellow employees. From day one, I felt totally supported. My regional once told me- ""I work for you. You work for your field employees. Your employees work for your customers."" I truly feel that my managers want me to succeed. I previously came from a company that didn't have this culture- and it is amazing what a difference it makes to your overall success and happiness not only with the company but personally as well. That being said- here is a list: 1) Progressive culture- you have a voice, upper management is open minded, and changes are made if it makes sense. 2) Invests in your success- your personal development is looked at every month. It is encouraging to know your manager is rooting for you. 3) Work life balance- no phone calls after 6pm, weekends off, everyone respects your off time. 4) Excellent compensation and benefits- generous paid time off, great pay and benefits, company stock. 5) Team work- this company might be big but it's unified. I haven't come across a department that wasn't willing to go out of their way to help you. 6) Company is picky on who they hire so you end up working with awesome people. 5k bonus for referring other district managers who on-board with the company.","When I think about the challenges that I've faced in this position, I'm reminded more of my supervisors and coworkers who've either gone out of their way to help me or make me laugh, and usually both! One con that I can think of is that because it is a large company, certain items must go through multiple approvals and back and forth communication between departments before taking course- which can make maintenance projects last longer than anticipated.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Love it- They're Stuck With Me,5.0,"Apr 18, 2020","Since the cost of housing in the Portland Metro is extremely high, the free apartment (with all utilities) is a great deal. No, Public Storage doesn't pay much-- but those smaller checks go a long way when you don't have to pay rent or utilities. I love the fact that I can walk out my front door two minutes before clock-in time and still be EARLY! Not every Public Storage has an on-site manager's apartment (nor does every manager cares to live where they work), but if a manager desire an on-site position, Public Storage is pretty good about working you into one. 27 days out of each month, Public Storage is, hands-down, the easiest job I've ever had. The remaining three days definitely keep you moving, but the WORST stress-level you experience here is on par with the AVERAGE day in most other retail-ish, dealing-with-the-public type of jobs. I used to manage a convenience store and vividly remember being so busy most days that you have to carefully strategize your bathroom breaks. That never happens at Public Storage. This is an outstanding job for self-motivated, self-starters who enjoy working independently. But if you require somebody standing over you and directing you all the time, or if you require the company of and interactions with co-workers, managing ANY storage facility would not be a good fit for you. Every day here is a little bit different, and Property Managers are often find themselves in the position of making judgment calls with customers and circumstances. But as long as your following company policies, management always has your back. The company's commitment to their employees shown during the COVID-19 situation was quite impressive and made me feel quite good about choosing to work here.","Sure would be nice if they were more pro-active about maintaining their properties, but maybe I'm just being picky.

Lost in the sea of Quantity over Quality.,2.0,"Jan 25, 2022","Free rent- as the resident manager I didn't pay rent. Because of the size of the company (total sites + head quarters) you never had to worry about them going under, which means not worrying about losing your housing as well which was a bonus during covid. I had a fixed schedule so I always knew it'd be off Sunday and Monday.","Theres so much to unpack here. We will start with the size. PS is doing do well they are able to aquire so many smaller companies, and build more locations, but while they are so focused on expanding, they are allowing other facilities to deteriorate. Gates broken for weeks, mold growing throughout buildings, damaged doors, cracked floors, deciding to cancel/forgo preventitive professional pest control, etc. Maintenance tickets get put in that sometimes go unnoticed, or gone about the cheapest way possible (I won't even start that rant). I understand needing to scale a buisness and they are such a huge company they will never change that but everything is always focused on quantity not quality. That goes for the employees too. Operations managers MIA, spoke to them maybe once? Very hierarchy, follow the chain of command. He meets most people, then anything else goes through your DM. Giving my DM the benefit of the doubt that she took on a big acquisition with poor communication, and she was probably over worked, but her lack of organization and poor time management was only matched by her unphased demeanor of everything. Unphased because at some point I'm pretty sure everyone dyes a little inside from being with this company. I had worked for 4 storage companies in 8 years, PS having acquired my previous company 4 months before I left the company. The sad part is people get sucked into PS because its easy money, free housing opportunities, etc but then have to work in these ""dumpster fires"" as everyone in my district would call the facilities, and not realize not all companies are that bad. Having gotten to work for great companies before, I can't say I wasn't biased going in, from hearing nothing but horror stories from previous employees from many levels from storage consultants to corporate (OMs/DMs/HRs). But there is a reason I left after 4 months.

A lot of work for very little recognition or pay !,2.0,"May 22, 2019","This job offers full-time hours, which is a perk in this dwindling job market. You are never scheduled less than 38 hours a week. You get benefits and start accruing PTO and sick time from your first day of employment. Training was about 3-4 weeks and once you're out, you are placed with a set property to work at. After 6 months, you are eligible to put your bid in to become property manager. Property managers get paid more and have the option to live on-site if the property has an apartment (which not all of them do). On the job, you learn a lot of different trades and you increase your skill set. You can pick your own 2 off days.","Where do I begin? The upper management is a mess. They are rarely on the same page, which creates so much tension in the district. A lot of broken promises and sweet nothings whispered in employees ears. No one knows where they stand with anyone. There is definitely favoritism something serious at this job and it can be a downer. The power that's given to the wrong person makes the turnover rate increase. The roster has changed so much over the years that the employees don't even know how soon they could be served their exit papers. You don't feel secure at all. The pay is laughable and not even livable and there is no room for negotiation in that regard. The pay isn't competitive so you get paid the same as someone with not even half of your experience. You wear many hats and do so many different things for honestly the bare minimum. The level of promotion doesn't reach as high as you think. You go from relief manager to property manager to KTP (key training professional). You would think that being here long-term would give you a shot at moving up the ranks to District Manager but that's not the case. There is no room for upward movement. The stress levels can reach dangerous levels so definitely have a hobby when you get off work. Also they don't tell you that only property managers can get Sundays off as one of their off days so you can only request the day off. That's really not an incentive to become a property manager but I guess who am I to judge? Overall, get the experience and after some time, move on to greener pastures.

Upper management respect for their workers fluccates based on the kind of numbers your store is pulling in and many of the tactics used for raising numbers are dishonest to the customer. There is little to no employee loyalty. It is also very hard as a property manager to take care of any facility problems (gate malfunctions, potholes, leaks) as Public Storage fights tooth and nail to not allot much of a quaterly budget in property maintence.

I was going through a really dark time in my life and I didn't work my hardest a lot of the time. That said, I can still say today that this was one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Some of the cons were: -Insultingly low pay for the amount of responsibility and travel that is often required. -Pretty much only one opportunity for advancement if you can even call it that. Relief managers could become property managers with their very own property. From what I remember though, it was the same pay for more responsibilities. You COULD get your own on-site apartment offered if you become a property manager, though only 2 properties out of like 7 in Tucson had one. -Properties in high crime areas can be pretty scary. Threatened on multiple occasions. -Properties would be frequently broken in to leaving you to deal with customers and police in extremely stressful situations. -Given all that needs to be accomplished, two people minimum should be working the storage property. Usually though, you were scheduled to work by yourself. Juggling cleaning units, doing lock checks, calling delinquent customers, and leasing units to customers can be really challenging. Slow days at slow properties are nice, but you'll often be working on busy properties with a million things to do. -Properties in high crime areas often have people living in the units with you often tasked with kicking them out of the property. Pretty stressful and dangerous situations can ensue. -Pushed hard to sell merchandise and insurance to customers without any incentive. Overall, I do take some responsibility for my negative experience. That said, for a job that barely pays above minimum wage, it just isn't worth it.

In fact, the overall score and tone of reviews made me hesitate applying for this position. I'm glad I did. I knew from the interview and on-boarding process that this was the place for me. You'll meet and interview with every level of management from DM to COO before an offer can be extended. I was encouraged to continue at each step of the process, thanks to the honest dialog about the what the job entailed, and the honest feedback as I progressed through my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th interview. Even more than that, the Regional Manager (my current boss) could not have created a more warm and welcoming environment. The training program is 4 months long, during which you will be fully compensated (12 months). As a DM you'll work closely and face to face with your peers in the region. Tasks that support the group will be broken up and shared amongst the team. Your Regional Manager is close by and well connected to your business. Expectations are high, but based on attainable goals that are easily tracked. You'll be empowered to run your business and recognized for your success. I came from a Big Box retailer with a hectic and unpredictable work schedule. PS values your time and expects that you have a life outside the office. That being said, this is no different than any other email and phone connected management position. A timely response is expected to all inquiries, and emergencies do come up.",I can think of one but there is a simple solution. We are lacking in real time performance updates at times.

Regional Vice President,5.0,"Nov 14, 2016","What i love it that the company is truly performance based at all positions of the organization. Each Month , each quarter you are ranked compared to your peers. This allows a individual to come in from the outside and get promoted based off of performance. The company is financially solid.As a fortune 500 company and to have the cash and the debt free balance sheet we are not in the same position of many companies out there that are going through restructures, and layoffs due to declining sells or in debt. I look at the retail companies out there that most of us came from and I see some closing , but most at a minimal are laying people off. Districts are expanding, and job responsibilities are increasing for same pay. Work Life balance for the being the retail world is night and day compared to where I am from. For the most part my phone doesn't ring after 6:00PM. All the property's are closed, all the employees have gone home for the day. There are those one off calls that I will get from a alarm company, and or customer service. If i compare that to the years in my previous career we didn't close until 11:00 and those calls didn't really stop till after 1:00AM This is a very thin organization. To have the ability to have the CEO in my market , or the President riding in my property's yearly is amazing. My divisional manager has been in my market at least 10 times this year. This by some may seem as a con. I see this as a pro. I get to be developed and influenced by the executives of the company often. In my previous career the CEO was never in my market even once. The president was there twice. This was over a 15 year period of time.",Like most companies i think the insurance cost is out of control. The amount of money I spend to cover myself and my family has climbed each and every year. We all are at work for our family's and to have the burden of paying for the insurance that are above the cost that most of us cannot any longer afford is disappointing . I wish we celebrated more. We do a great job at our annual sales conference of celebrating out top performers. We do a great job of making that week incredible for all of our district managers and above.

Happily @ Public Storage,5.0,"Jun 30, 2017","The company - Great company, solid financials, quality product and portfolio, high-integrity execution of the business plan. The people – Hard working, tireless work ethic, relentless attention to detail; nobody “above” any specific task when it needs to get done. Longevity and loyalty to the company permeate all levels of staff and leadership. The facility (corporate office) – Well maintained and recently renovated interior/exterior, great parking, ease of access from the 5 Fwy. The work – Wildly diverse and on a scope and scale this is tough to complain about. You will not be bored..! The pace is fast and exciting, no 2 days alike… Bottom Line If you’re looking for a challenge in your career, this is a great place to work; if you’re looking to coast and hide among the crowd, don’t waste your (and their) time. This is a lean running, rock solid company with amazing people and a tireless drive to be the very best in the industry; so far, for me, it’s been great ride…!","The company – Given the legacy and power of the brand, being at the top, there is little time to rest and enjoy the fruits of your labor. The next threat, urgent project, initiative or opportunity is always just around the corner. You always have to be on your toes and ready to go in a different direction if needed. The people – Like any company this well-established, new ideas can be harder to introduce than what might be observed at a younger upstart company; there can be growing pains when giving up the “old way” of doing something. The fortunate thing here is that in contrast, leadership does not fall into this category; there is a constant pressure to reinvent as needed to stay at the forefront. The facility (corporate office) – The location is freeway convenient, but isn’t immediately adjacent to any shops/restaurants. Pack a lunch or plan a short drive over into Burbank or Glendale. (note, the in-office lunch room, coffee and break areas are clean and functional; and don’t forget bagel Fridays!) The work – It’s not always predictable and it can be discouraging not being able to gain momentum when tides change. If you are the type that needs an ultra-stable plan and very predictable work, this may not be a fit for you.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Mine were 90% awesome :) Customers: Can be very great.","1. Micro-managed sometimes, undermanaged others. This made it very difficult to obtain a good balance. 2. Over-worked in some areas (always working alone and being expected to make all calls AND memorize 4 new scripts a week at times)...under-worked in others (there were at least 2 weeks a month where 4-6 hours of an 8 hour day I had nothing to do). 3. Management: I don't know where to begin. This is the ONLY job I ever had where managers felt the need to try and turn team members against each other. I have read other reviews from other areas, so I know it's not just my area, plus I worked for PS on both coasts in my 3 yrs with them. Sometimes I felt like they broke their backs to help us out, other times it felt like we were just an irritant when things like the security system breaking (in one case, the security system was down OVER A YEAR and we still had to sell the great security to new customers like it worked). My last 2 years my team was under a constant threat of firing...what our DM failed to understand was that we were all friends in and out of work and shared the interviews with one another--he was telling all of us the same thing.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

OK to get some baseline experience... and use it for that,2.0,"Feb 11, 2014",Training program was efficient and complements some customer service and sales. The opportunity to meet new people daily and hear different stories was cool also.,"Biggest dissatisfaction here was compensation. Two aspects need to be considered by management and really brought to attention of employees 1) *Underpayment on an industry basis*- regional competitors offer much higher wages. If I can get paid 20% more by a competitor, that devalues my view of the company and the results I want to achieve. 2) *Undervaluing of employees and their results*- at this position you will be doing a great variety of things to contribute for the operation of the store including but not limited too: sales (contacting new leads through walk-ins, internet reservations or referrals), customer service (some upset customers about promotion pricing and definitely about increased rates for repeat customers), operations (ensuring everything at that location in terms of supplies or maintenance issues is addressed timely and efficiently), vendor management (working with companies that contract with PS for maintenance issues) and last but not least labor (yes you will be putting the gloves on in this position!) *No promotion opportunities*- Also, ironically... this company does not really promote from within! Almost all middle management on a district and regional basis came from other companies and usually other industries. Inadept company policies- About every other month senior management tries to inact a new policy to boost sales, reservations or gauge on merch pricing.

Excellent resume builder,4.0,"May 15, 2015","If you work hard, and have the right work ethic the compensation will certainly show for it. Coworkers are all very close knit and it feels very much like a family. Upper management DM's and higher are all great, very friendly and will push you to meet your expectations. If you don't want to work for your recognition, and be competitive in your sales then this is not the job for you; as a property manager and KTP there is a lot of responsibility and some stress involved but it takes the right mindset to handle and if you love helping people learn about a company you believe in then it is a piece of cake. There are yearly bonus incentives based on sales numbers which are generous if you are within the top percentile of sales within your region, as well as yearly raises also based on performance.","Sometimes the customers are very difficult to deal with, even as a property manager and KTP (which is as high as you can go as a field associate) there is no power to make any decisions; everything must be escalated to DM for approval. There is room to move up through the field but after KTP you're at a dead end. There is no such thing as hiring from within, and you cannot advance after you make it to key training professional, which results in a somewhat high turnover rate for retaining valuable employees that the company should not want to lose.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

I have been under the direction of several DM'S while in my career with PS and have made many new friendships with coworkers that are now like family. It takes hard work and the right mindset to make this company and job work for you so therefore it is not for everyone. But if you give it your all and have a great work ethic then you will find a lasting place with PS. And the award pays off in the long run.,The pay is not the greatest and yes it could be more for all that you do. You are pressured to make numbers which is overwhelming at times.

Quit mid-shift because of my district manager,3.0,"Jan 17, 2023","All in all, not a bad company to work for! Bi-monthly pay results in big checks when you work the amount of hours I racked up in each pay period. I love the ability to self manage your time and work load. The independence of not having higher ups breathing over you. They allow you to make your own daily plan based on the work load on a given day.","Some days the work load is literally unbearable. When tenants leave property behind the ONE relief/property manager working that day is responsible for disposing of it properly. There is an option to put in a maintenance request to have it removed but the list of requests is so long it takes weeks and sometimes MONTHS to get taken care of. Customers are either super cool, or TERRIBLE and rude. Depending on location, the lots can take a serious toll on your vehicle. There is only so much any one individual can get done in a shift, and a lot of customers have no sense of empathy towards the situation so they tend to talk to you like garbage. Rent increases also contribute to the attitudes received. Gates always seem to be broken and again, maintenance requests can sit for months at a time sometimes. It can get pretty rough. My personal experience was more negative than anything because of my unique experience with my direct district manager. He had no sense of empathy to peoples personal lives so when I got pregnant during employment he expected me to still preform every work function to my usual ability. I was still maintaining the most important daily functions and working more than my energy level approved of, but with a baby on the way I did it.

There is about 4 hours of work in an 8 hour day , sometimes less so that gives you an option of going back to school because you have time to do homework at work. The hours are nice , 930 to 6 no overnight. Pretty good insurance benefits.","No room for growth, I've been here 4 months and I'm already a property manager but unfortunately that's as high as there is to go because they don't hire within for the upper management jobs. Pay is pretty awful, I make 10.50 an hour and when I got hired it was made clear that the pay was non negotiable. If you live in an apartment at one of the properties you basically get paid 8 an hour because they charge you to live there and watch THEIR property, it's ridiculous. It's been very obvious that the people that make the wages and rules don't care about who they are making the wages and rules for. I don't make enough money to pay bills like car , phone insurance etc, AND live in a place of my own so I live with my parents at 28 years old. Which is why I put in the pros that there is time to do homework because if you ever want to make more than 10.50 an hr you are going to have to go to school. The thing is, is that the things we deal with and the kind of work , even if it's only 4 hours of work in an 8 hour day, deserves more than what they are willing to offer. There are lots of angry customers that upper management won't deal with and won't call back so we are the ones that get yelled at.

An organization that has it backwards,1.0,"Apr 1, 2020",You will be forced to improve your time management and prioritization skills. Those who do not focus on this will be left behind.,"Every publicly traded organization has three customers to prioritize: 1) the Wall Street customer (investors) 2) the external customer (those who purchase goods/services) and 3) the internal customer (the employee). Public storage has prioritized them in exactly that order. All questions, complaints, and concerns are looked at through a lens of ""what will this do to the bottom line?"" As a previous shareholder I can appreciate a focus on yielding returns and dividends, but as a former internal customer it was clear there was no balance in decision making. Front-line employees are paid minimum wage, or barely above, and asked to do unthinkable tasks due to the nature of the work. When asked why pay increases were so rare and unlikely, the response always referred back to Senior Leaderships approach that we can always ""find more minimum wage people out there."" As an internal employee that led front-line employees, you act as every department. You're required to lead R&M efforts, manage payroll, recruit vendors, handle customer escalations, manage IT issues, work with Legal department, manage operational projects, etc... There are NO SUPPORT PARTNERS to aid in any aspect of your job. Successful organizations have layers of support built in to support their most important customer: the internal one. Public Storage elects to remove those layers to reduce costs. There are no pay raises for any level of leadership. There is an annual offer of Restricted Stock Units that required 5 years minimum to vest and are consistently reducing in value due to the stock price falling. The work conditions are horrible and the environment is toxic for anyone with an executive maturity level seeking to grow their career. As a district manager your phone is never off. Minimum wage employees that realize they're not valued simply can't be reliable. District Managers are required to do the entry-level position at work as a Property Manager when the staffing model restricts payroll and resources. There were countless times where a peer or I had to work at a property and do our ""day job"" simultaneously. This is not a CAREER. This is a JOB that is designed to churn and burn when your best work is completed with promises of promotion that are not fulfilled.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Our best days are ahead of us. A great place to work.,5.0,"Jan 26, 2015","I wanted to comment on Public Storage and provide some thoughts as my outlook is very positive. When I am interviewing prospective candidates, a question that I am regularly asked without fail is “What do I like most about the company?” My reply is always the people I work with. Full disclosure, I am in a management position, but whether it’s the property personnel I interact with, DMs, Regional Managers, Corporate Execs or Support, there is a common trait within our organization, and that is we pride ourselves on hard work. Public Storage fosters a strong culture of teamwork and a palpable desire to provide support to each other, at all levels within the organization. For those that are willing to learn, remain challenged and bring their best selves to work each day will do very well here. Furthermore, Public Storage is a company that is growing, and that makes this an incredibly dynamic place to work. With strong leadership, very little debt, a keen desire to grow intelligently coupled with the enviable position of the market leader – for all these reasons and more, it reinforces my decision to be here. The opportunities are present for hourly employees to take on more challenging roles as well; agreeable full-time hours allow for the opportunity to go to school and a high quality of life; and on-site apartments allow living accommodations in desirable markets. For District Managers, with our incredible growth, comes the opportunity to move into higher-level positions with increased responsibility. In short, Public Storage presents a very dynamic environment that will reward those who are willing to learn and put in the time and effort. Are we perfect? No. But few organizations are. Is it a place work making a living or building a career? Absolutely.","We are growing and with change comes discomfort at times. But the fact that we are willing to look at how we operate and reassess our business, this I view as very positive.

Reviews are Misleading! But not the negative ones for this company.,1.0,"May 24, 2019","Pay for DM’s was good over the years. If you started in the early days and managed money well, you are in great shape. In addition, there were some great leaders to learn from....oh wait, they usually get fired once the CEO hears them say one thing he doesn’t agree with. This is NOT an opinion nor isolated to one instance. Anyways, thanks to those great leaders who provided a wealth of knowledge!","As a previous DM and RVP with this company, please do not fall in to this trap. The stock grants were so good in the past that it used to make misery worth it, but now the measly 12 share per year vest is simply not worth the stress. Also, ethics and integrity are out the window here. If you are over 40 with tons of multi unit experience, you need not apply. Hiring managers are coached to label you as “ downside of career” which is their way of saying “too old.” Perhaps the EEOC should be alerted to these practices?Also, they realize that you are most likely too smart to put up with the craziness. Instead, they like to hire young, give them a life changing salary and wait for them to burn out. They will just get more when they need to. If you hate taking care of customers, this is the place for you because you don’t have the authority to do so. Try explaining to customers why PS (billion dollar company)has not replaced a 30 yr old roof that is supposed to protect their belongings. Or why a brand new building has mold because the company didn’t want to pay for dehumidifiers . Please pay close attention to the great reviews from the RVP’s and DM’s . Look at the dates when they come in. Funny that they come in around the same days??? It is a directive from above to try and increase ratings and they are simply not true. If you do come here, hope for a great leader that can filter the corp direction well. Also, don’t be fooled by a DM title. You are in control of very little. Think “high paid baby sitter.” Your turnover will be high unless you have the cash to incentivize your team out of your own pocket.

Horrible compay to work for.,1.0,"Dec 11, 2014",There are no pros. There is nothing positive to say. Read all reviews. This is a company that had the HR Directors call new District Managers to ask them to write positive reviews on Glass Door because the reviews they had were horrible.,"Honestly...there are no pros to working here. There is no home/work balance. It's all work. They expect their district managers to work 24/7, and have even made statements that this job ""is not 8 to 6 anymore...you must do work before 8 and after 6"". You really do have to work long days--the expectation is high and so is the workload. Unfortunately the pay is not. There is a base commute that they take out of your mileage so this leaves you driving all over and receiving pennies for your travel. The expectations on the property managers are great, but their pay borders on the poverty level. Public Storage is very well run and is extremely profitable, but this comes at the cost of the employees. There is little to no recognition. The CEO stated at an annual conference that the company is ""puking cash"". What a fantastic statement to make in front of managers brought to the meeting making minimum wage or slightly above. One property manager commented to us that if the company is puking cash how come none of the lights work outside on her property and nothing ever gets repaired. They promote heavily from the DM level and above, but you need to be a favorite of the Regional VP--you don't necessarily have to be the smartest, or best at your job, but you sure need to be liked by the Regional. They have hired many new district managers all over the country and this is really the direction they are moving in. New blood--in with the new and out with the old. If you are great at driving results by beating your team down this is the job for you! Just keep asking them to get you those results by giving them nothing in return. Think twice before you accept the position. They will sell you on the company and how they run the business, but once you're in you will regret your choice.

They never visit a property unless they are being visited from their bosses, then it's all a dog-and-pony show, and will flat out lie about being in the field with the employees. I literally have a Regional Manager that doesn't know half my team and has never been to 30% of my properties. Pay is very low compared to other District Managers at other storage companies. I know this because most of PS Managers leave for that very reason. For about 4 days each month, you're cutting locks all day. Other storage companies do not require DMs to cut locks. Look- turnover with Property Managers is so high, all you do as a DM is recruit and hire, and scramble to fill your schedules with a warm body to hopefully get your property open on time. This is causing the District Managers to start jumping ship because the work sucks. There are so many DMs leaving, or in the process of leaving, that I feel bad for the current DMs that will be having to run their own districts, plus keep others afloat since there will be open districts. Because of the high DM turnover, you are now seeing Regional Managers posting 5-star reviews on Glass Door hoping they can fool you into thinking this is a great company.

Terrible Corporate Culture,1.0,"Oct 19, 2014","Your check. That's it.

The executives couldn't care less about any of it's employees. To them, you are but a cog in the money making machine. Regional Managers (you're not VPs) think they're important, but really they are just losers that have become complacent in life and bought into the whole PS BS. They're good at taking orders from the Divisional Managers, who are the first level of management with any amount of authority. My Regional obsessed over the most trivial points, such as stickers on the front door, or the number of rolls of tape on the counter. Thinking outside the box to solve issues wasn't a possibility, because he didn't even realize he was in a box.

Know this, while you'll be tempted by the decent base salary, you're going to be working long, hard hours for it...doing mindless tasks....which repeat every month. Don't even for a second count on the bonus, it's tiered and capped, and easily manipulated by the executive team. Training is OTJ, and lackluster.

A dead end job.,1.0,"Jan 25, 2016","Hours (no nights), full time (38-39 hours), decent PTO accrual, benefits, set days off (depending on your DM), on-site apartment at some properties (if you're a property manager). The people you work with are, on average, the nicest people you'll know. I made some great friends. There is LOTS of down time in the office on slow days since we're not supposed to leave it closed for more than 15 minutes, so if you're a student you'll have time to study (though you'll get in trouble if you get caught.) Rainy days are best.","Hooo boy. First off, the company used to be better. Go back 5 or 6 years and the bonuses and PTO payouts were MUCH better. Old time employees who'd been there a decade or more told stories of how there used to be company parties and trips to baseball games. No more. Over time, the company has shed practically every benefit. Bonuses used to be a major perk every quarter. Now they're a joke. Not even everyone gets one, and those who do generally get the lowest tier. Since it's based on DM preference rather than your numbers, if the DM doesn't like you, you aren't getting a bonus. PTO benefits have also been cut, and health costs have risen. All the while they ask more and more of the property level staff while telling them about how the company is puking money. It's great coming home to your little apartment broke, tired, and dirty knowing that you just made your company thousands of dollars that you'll never see. The job is a thankless, dirty one. You will usually work alone. This means you have to close the office to do anything outside (and you will be doing things outside), which will generally lead to angry customers. I was cursed out on several occasions by people who had to wait for me to return from a bank run or lunch. Speaking of lunch, many properties don't have break rooms. Since we wear uniforms, eating in your car is out (unless you like people knocking on your window!), so you have to eat in the office with people trying to peer through the door at you. I often ate sitting on the floor or in the bathroom to avoid this, as if customers catch sight of you, they'll start banging on the door. One of my coworkers actually got in trouble for ignoring a customer while on his state-mandated lunch break because the customer saw him and called customer service to complain. Explain that! There's no security. I dealt with transients, people with mental problems, and tweakers. As a rather petite woman, I was afraid to do lock checks on dark evenings, and I have no idea how people in the northern parts of the country do this job during the winter because of how early it gets dark. The properties are poorly lit so there are ample opportunities for something bad to happen. I carried mace. The properties are falling apart because the DMs aren't given money to order repairs. Doors were broken and difficult to open, parking lots were pitted, there were plumbing issues (three times this resulted in us having no bathroom), lighting issues, tripping hazards... You name it. We had elevators break, doors to buildings break... It was just unsafe. The equipment we're given are not designed for the heavy amount of work we do (sweeping out a 10x30 space with an office broom is awful). Most properties in my district had their golf carts taken away because the properties were ""too small"". I was often logging 3 miles plus on my pedometer, so I have no idea where they got this idea. Customers would show up in the rain and then complain that they had to walk to the space they wanted to rent. I had customers whine about having to walk in the heat of summer too. Good luck if you get someone who has a hurt leg or is old. We're not supposed to use our cars (though I often did). Customers are slobs and will leave cigarette butts and discarded furniture everywhere. I have dragged more dirty, gross mattresses to the dumpster than I care to remember. You will also come in contact with animal and human urine and feces. ""Pee bottles"" are a common occurrence. Without a golf cart, you'll be walking around with a garbage bag and broom during your lock check. If you find an empty space, congratulations! You get to trek back to the company space to get your kit to clean it. The company only wants you out of the office for 15 minutes at a time, by the way, so have fun doing this on days when you're alone. What ended up happening was that a lot of us just stopped cleaning the spaces on weekdays. If I had to rent it, I'd offer to clean it for the customer, but we generally would clean on Saturdays, when we had double coverage (if we were lucky enough to get it) Customers did the stupidest things, and then would get angry at you for it. They would move out without telling you and leave their lock on their space, expecting us to magically know they're done. They'd dump garbage and food on the property. They'd break into the restroom after hours and make a mess. Then they would complain about the property looking messy. They'll show up to rent a space with 5 minutes until the end of the day after you called them a hundred times throughout the day to schedule them an appointment. They'd wait until the last second to pay their bill and then would get mad at us if we were out to lunch or at the bank. Field staff have loads of metrics they're supposed to meet, as I hinted at above. Most are now clustered around sales of overpriced merchandise. Meeting them can be very easy or very hard depending on what property you're at and how busy you are. Slow property in a good area? Piece of cake. Busy property in the ghetto? Good luck. The company thinks that every property is the same regardless of location or clientele, so expect no sympathy from your bosses. You also have to sell locks and insurance, and both are overpriced. The locks are cheap Chinese steel with keys that often get stuck. We would open all of the locks up when we received them and test the keys just to make sure the locks weren't broken. The insurance is absolute junk. It barely covers anything and the limitations are ridiculous (if someone breaks into your space and steals your lock, guess what? Your insurance won't cover it because the lock is missing.) The worst thing in the world that can happen to you is getting stuck with a ""dud"", a person who wants to just move in and brings their own lock and refuses insurance or merchandise. Since there are no incentives for actually renting units, these people count against you. It pits you against your customer and makes you get angry with people just for being money smart. Left a bad taste in my mouth. GOOGLE REVIEWS. First it was 1 a month, then 2, then 4. They will harass you to no end if you don't meet your quotas. This especially sucks if you work multiple properties. You may work hard to meet the quota at one property just to rotate into one that has 0 reviews the next day. Guess what? You're going to get accusatory emails asking why you aren't doing your job right. Oh, AND you get to do calls! You will be on the phone almost as much as you're outside. You have prorate calls, auction calls, collection calls, confirmation calls, follow up calls... So many calls. Depending on your property, you may be doing 100+ calls a week. It's mind numbing, incredibly boring work, and you'll get sick of talking to the same people week after week. If you end up with lots of people who can't pay? That's your fault. One of our scripts for delinquency literally had us suggesting they borrow money from a friend or family member to pay their storage bill. You can guess how most people reacted to that. Since the job is miserable and pays near minimum wage, a lot of people don't actually do their jobs. Since the temptation to be lazy is strong, if you're not lazy you're going to be picking up the slack. Think that all sounds bad? Well, you get to do all of the above with scripts. That's right, PS has written scripts for practically every interaction you have with a customer. You'll rarely use them with real customers (oftentimes the customer would derail the script within two lines. It's hard to stick to a script when the other party isn't), but you'd better know them because the DMs will quiz you. This can happen at any time. They show up monthly to tour the property, but you can also get called out on conference calls. PLUS, they send out secret shoppers. Don't screw up a script on a secret shop, or you can be written up. This whole situation makes the job much more stressful than it needs to be. We on the ground knew how to do our jobs, but the company insisted we do it THEIR way, which was nearly impossible for some people. My numbers went down when using the scripts. Having a system that works that you're afraid to use makes the job nervewracking. The icing on the cake is that there's no room to advance. They don't hire from within, even if you have a degree. They also won't allow you to list your DM as a reference on a job application, and if you do, you will immediately have a target on your back. The moment PS knows you want out, they'll try to hack you off like a diseased limb. It is the literal definition of a dead end job.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

There was a gas leak from one of the heaters, They wouldn't call for repair service. There was black mold in the office and utility closet that was making me sick. I was told to purchase bleach with my own money (we were not allowed to order it),and scrub it off the wall. I was told to never mention it again.

They do critic you, as any boss would, but not in a way that demeans you.

Worst company I've ever worked for.,1.0,"Jan 1, 2015","Everyone in upper management at this company is a actor and liar. They lead you to believe this is a awesome company with a ""family"" culture, great benefits, and growth potential. Nothing could be further from the truth. Let's start with the job title - property or relief manager. A real manager makes decisions and has a paycheck that reflects this. At Public Storage they micromanage you, just about every outcome has been outlined already. If there is something that isn't covered don't think for yourself....call your District Manager if you want to keep your job. Relief managers start out making $9.50 (in Georgia) and with time might make as much as $12. The benefit of living in company sponsored housing sounds great but there is a catch. It's not completely free! If you live on site they lower your pay rate by a few dollars per hour. Sure, your rent is still inexpensive but now you are making almost minimum wage. Also when you separate from the company they expect you to move out in 48 hours which is added pressure on you mentally to do a awesome job. Growth potential is a joke because the ceiling is very low. As a relief manager you can become a property manager when a store becomes available. That's a .50 cent raise and a lot more responsibility, YEAH!. You may also be selected to be a new hire trainer or safety captain which pays about a dollar more each. Raises across the board are rare. The only way to make some real money ($70,000) is to be hired directly as a District Manager (or higher). This company does not promote from within which is the dumbest thing ever. The duties include 40+ collection calls a day, cleaning toilets, sweeping/mopping, unloading/counting inventory, pressuring customers to buy things they don't need, reading scripts word for word, and dealing with attitudes of your simple minded co-workers. The job functions alone (and individually) are not difficult however you will work alone 90% of the time and are expected to get everything done even though you can't leave the office for more than 15 minutes at a time. This job is a complete joke and a slave camp. I thought working for Walmart was bad but Public Storage takes the cake. All these ""positive"" reviews are fake and written by upper management. They likely check this site often and write great things to push down the negative feedback.",The benefits are decent.

Property manager,1.0,"Nov 7, 2018",If there is anything positive about this company for half to be the hours. Not great but they are ok.,"Where do I start? 1. They do not care about the employees. I was working at my site with out working and proper air conditioning during the summer for three months. 2. When I was working for the company they took away the bonuses that the property managers could get if they reach the goal. 3. If something breaks at the property either plumbing or anything like that you have to put in a work order and wait till management feels like approving it. Same thing also goes for clean outs on units with trash(more than normal) the employees are responsible for “breaking down” the small items to toss because the company will not pay for a vendor clean out. 4. If you are with out power or internet you are still required to work a full day and show units. Really not a big problem well it can be. If you have no idea what the units are priced as and if any specials. 5. Most sites are old and falling apart. Most units are without power and either have holes in the walls or falling insulation. 6. The company says that they care about customers well they do not. They raise the rent 6 months after a customer rents the unit. So if you get a unit for 112 and with everything else added on it comes out to 122 six months from then it will go up to about 145. Oh and you can not request a rate decrease because the pricing on the u it’s change every day. 7. Every property sets goals to reach for payments, merchandise sold, units rented/vacated. And if you fail to make the goals then you are scolded for doing a poor job. 8. Potentially getting fired for not calling all the numbers on the account for a reminder call to pay for that month. Even tho it’s not required to call the emergency contact. 9. Poor upkeep on the apartments that are attached and can be rented for property managers. Now you are thinking well that’s great I get to work and I am being placed into a house. Wrong you go from making 11 an hour to 8 an hour 10. The pay how can I put this nicely it’s trash. 11 per hour with out potential for a raise. It’s terrible when you work for this company keep in mind that you are required to rent and clean every unit. Does not matter if it is hot, cold, raining, or snowing you have to. Calling customers and getting screamed at or hung up on. Having the district manager harp on you because your numbers for payments are too high. I can tell you that I know I’m missing a lot of other things that are terrible about this company and why you should not work for them.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Former property manager 2.5 years,1.0,"Oct 11, 2015",Really nothing.. Other than set working hours. If you like to work independently that could be considered a plus. This was the worst job I have ever had.,"This was one of the WORST jobs I have ever had. As a field employee you are expected to lie to customers, if you don't you will be reprimanded and told you are not doing your job. I worked in Kansas City area.. We had a thief working for us and entire deposits would come up missing.. NOTHING was done.. 99% of the time my boss wouldn't even call the police or report it. You are paid crap to deal with horrible customers who don't pay for months the scream and threaten you because they are going to auction . The security cameras don't work and even though the company makes billions and basically pays one person minimum wage to handle the entire 500+ unit property they refuse to spend the small amount it would take to better protect customers AND employees.. I was robbed at gunpoint and they still would not fix cameras... I once had 100+ units broken into on the same night, that got the higher ups attention ( for a few hours) then I was left alone to personally contact by phone 100 people then deal with them coming in and screaming at me one by one. You can only take so much when your company does NOTHING to help you in these situations.. After the break in (walls were damaged) I had customers coming in weeks later PISSED because their were holes in the walls still! (Hadn't been fixed in weeks) but they were still expected to pay on time with a unit that was unsecured. This is a horrible company, it really is. Save yourself the trouble. You will deal with hateful customers on a regular basis. The first day I started out of training I was slapped in the face by a woman who had her lock cut by my supervisor. This job is NOT WORTH IT! They force you to lie and clearly don't care about employees I mean hell! They don't even care about the customers. Also don't be fooled.. If you take an apartment you will regret it. Aside from people knocking on your door at all times of the night most apartments have mold and damage and they are never fixed. I personally have two friends who moved out because the mold was so bad it made her sick. She took pictures and submitted to DM...

Many properties are single staffed... 3) Waiting for repairs....it takes forever to get repairs done...to the property and the apartment. The only way to get it done fast is to have a customer call customer service and complain,otherwise they are not trying to spend any money.... 4)This should have been #1....the scripts!!! Which don't work...and sound robotic! Regular customers don't want to hear that each time you call them and will even say it with you to show you how robotic you sound....Roll playing.... 5)Bonuses...when I first started we would bonus every quarter....then it went to once a month....now if the district manager feel like you deserve it,then you will get a small bonus.

Property Manager,1.0,"Aug 28, 2018",It's a job with solid 40 hours and a check.,"The pay is a joke. The demands and expectations, realistic. If you want a job that rewards you for the hardwork you put in, look elsewhere. If you enjoy earning minimum wage with no incentives or room for real advancement, then this is the job for you. They have expectations for a flawlessly clean facility but are unwilling to provide you with the supplies to do so. I have fellow property managers at other locations going to the store, buying their own cleaning supplies to take to work. You will deal with angry customers regarding rate increases every 6-12 months in which the company will expect you to inform the customer it's to ""offset increases we incur for operating the business"", however, nothing EVER gets fixed. It is like pulling teeth to get this company to fix something such as lighting issues, damaged walls, graffiti, and security issues. These types of issues will keep getting pushed from quarter to quarter. All so that upper management can get their bonus for keeping repair costs under 20% compared to last year. And their bonus per quarter will make you sick to your stomach. In two quarters they will make what a property/relief manager gets paid in one year. No bonuses anymore for property/relief managers except for their ridiculous YouTube video contests which is just low-key free advertisements for the company. As an employee, you will also get constantly harassed about not meeting your sales goals on merchandise, locks, and insurance.

Property Managers are not empowered to make any decisions, so they will call you multiple times per day. The scripts change every month and you must memorize them word-for-word, then waste time making sure your entire district knows these scripts by heart. PS focuses on idiotic things like calling customers 7-10 times a month for rent payment, even if a 3 year history clearly shows this customer pays on the last day of the month, every month. You still better have 7-10 document phone calls to harass this customer. PS wastes so much energy on petty things that in no way improve the business and then the things that need attention don't get done. Also, you NEVER have an adequate budget for the maintenance required. So many emergencies happen and you HAVE to get that stuff fixed, so you can never keep up on maintaining properties. Every DM I ever knew had thousands and thousands of unpaid bills each month due to this problem. MANY companies make PS pay cash only due to a history of not paying their bills on time.

Former Relief/Acting PM. A very hard working place with very low pay,1.0,"Jun 25, 2016","The only good pros about this place where the hours. Pretty steady although they could have been more ""family"" friendly on the weekends. It could be considered a transitional job for fresh out of college young adults. Not a longevity job for sure. Health benefits where ok but good have been better.","Low pay, lots of work. You deal with all types of life at this place. Bums, drug addicts, homeless people. Not everyone off course is bad. I'll just say the rest are students, people moving, death in the family, divorce etc, They don't promote from within. They do keep a segregation between field personal and corporate. If you start at the bottom as in Relied Manager you can only go as far as Property Manager. You can't advance to Disrtict Manager and on even thought you may or may not have a degree. It is not a place to work for many years. You're pay will not increase accordingly. All thought profits for this company are high. You won't see a lot in your paycheck. While we all know that corporate will see a nice chunk of change in theirs. The CEO boast about yearly hard work and we don't see a change in our paycheck. He get a nice one because he shows to the board that he can make the company money. They opened new facilities spend millions in expanding and yet you still get paid the same amount. You deal with a lot of ""crazy"" people as well. You need a lot of psychology and a lot of patience, but that can also get very thin. Besides cleaning, renting units, taking payments all that other office work you do you are left alone a lot of the time. I call it a skeleton crew. They don't like spending in staffing because it cuts into their thin staffing budget. Disrtict managers are stressed to make the numbers. That's all the company cares about. The bottom line. Workers in the field are stressed to the breaking point. Not a healthy environment. I lasted almost 4 years and couldn't not handle it anymore. A ton of disrespect and a big lack of care. Bussines ethics are on the floor. All the care about is money. Every single customer is a walking dollar sign. Corporate abuse at its best. Poor customer service. Customer get thrown back and forward. The number one complain was that when I worked there. This job requires a minimum of $15 with all the headaches and frustrations I had to deal with. They unwrap you like bubble gum chew you up and when the flavor runs out you don't get spit out they just keep chewing you until you can't take it anymore. So my advice to you is think about VERY GOOD before you take this. Oh and about weekend. These guys are all business. They don't care if you have a family. The hours on the weekend are like carved in stone. No compassion for the family man. I missed a lot of good things with my family just to work and be a good worker but as you can see it didn't get me anywhere. Oh I almost forgot. They make us learn dumb scripts just so that we can't be honest with the customer. They say it's to ""perfect"" the sales technique. We can't think outside the box. They are afraid that you may actually know something they don't. Also they claim to be very safe. What a lie. Older properties to newer properties get broken into. Older properties more. So much money get put into the newer properties that the older ones get less money for repairs. Leading into more beak ins. We have to convinced the potential customers that the place is like Fort Knox. I stopped reading the script when customers asked that question. I said it can happen. It's NOT Fort Knox. I stopped caring in the end. That's how burn out you will get. So again think about very well. The mental abuse from customers is not worth it. If you stay you will end up hating this place with a vegeance. No stock option for the low field employees, but available for DM's and above.

Only if you're out of options...,1.0,"May 1, 2015","Apartment (but it comes at a huge price), working alone at many stores","I wish I could give negative stars. I suspect most positive reviews on here have been solicited by the company (from company employees) to improve it's image. This brings me to Google reviews. Google reviews are not a good representation of each property or manager. There is such an emphasis on Google reviews that they are faked by employees or the employee hounds customers until they write something. This goes against Google's policy but Public Storage apparently doesn't care. This is the least of the company's problems. SALES, SALES, SALES! Employees are expected to sell overpriced and typically unnecessary merchandise to customers who can barely afford the $1 promo! If you lose a sale, you are berated by your DM and most likely put on an action plan or forced to call said DM to explain why you couldn't sell merchandise to a customer who throws $23 on your counter and can't pay a penny more. The company has lost focus. We rent storage units while providing the best customer service experience possible. Yet, customers are harassed to buy merch then write a Google review WHILE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE EMPLOYEE. This is simply not good business. District Managers try to have more power than they truly do. They are merely pawns in a very bad game of ""business"". From my experience (and experiences I've gathered from others), DM's tend to play favorites, which decreases morale and simply divides a district. The company appears to allow this? The Compliance Hotline, in which they are reported for such behavior, doesn't do anything more than cause retaliation and give a slap on the wrist. I have never worked for a company with such unorganized and incompetent management. Lower level DMs don't really have the power but certainly act as such. Property Managers are not really managers. They have no power whatsoever. No power to call maintenance, coach relief managers, or simply waive a late fee. Property Managers are held responsible for maintenance issues but the requests must go through the DM. Good luck getting the DM to get the job done. The KTP(which is the most advanced position to hold in the field) has NO power or further input than anyone else. Finally, the pay and security. The pay is not good. The job requirements deserve more than such a minimal salary. Also, some work at locations in very bad areas. The company doesn't place any sort of emphasis on security or seem to care. The DMs have (mine, at least) made the year end bonuses personal, rather than based on actual metrics. This job is simply not worth doing unless you have no options. Avoid!

They want you to lie and push unecessary items; overpriced locks & merchandise as well as necessary insurance that is completely useless should they need to file a claim. Let's not forget the ridiculous pressure we have to put on customers to give us social media reviews. They must mention the employee name or else they don't count. Majority of the time, customers don't want to give you a review. They just want to do whatever they need to and get out. They don't repair or invest in capital improvements so you will have to face upset customers that aren't getting their unit repaired, for example. There's also a huge lack in care of security. When a tenant's unit gets broken into, you'll have the pleasure of getting yelled at and upper management won't care or support you in any way. District managers definitely play favorites. There's no support at all. All they care about is meeting their numbers and if you don't pressure customers into the things mentioned above, they'll fire you. The management gets worse and worse as you go higher and higher up the chain. They pay frontline employees minimum wage with no opportunity for pay increases unless minimum wage goes up. Get ready to move heavy furniture on your own as well. Not only do you rent units, you're a janitor cleaning up feces and bodily fluids, get to move nasty abandoned items ranging from boxes full of unwanted items to large pieces of furniture and appliances. No, they won't hire a third party company to do this for you. This is why they're paying you minimum wage, remember? They need to save all they can to pay upper management and corporate personnel top dollar. That will never be you by the way. The highest you can be is a trainer. You'll get an extra dollar added to your pay but forget getting promoted any further. And of course, the transients. Homeless people need somewhere to store their stuff. They'll take advantage of the $1 promo to misuse the storage space. They try to live in there, spend unecessary amounts of time there, do drugs, ect. You have to play cop and manage the transients. Some of them will get hostile with you, and if they're crazy enough, believe me they will. No, upper management won't care. Other tenants will also give you crap about the transients onsite. Something else to deal with. Overall, I would rather sell my organs on the black market than to ever work for this abomination of a corporation ever again. Notice how district managers are the majority of positive reviews. Of course someone making $100k+ a year, not having to deal with customers or the other fun things I mentioned above, would be happy with their job.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
Property Manager,1.0,"Feb 18, 2014",Only pro I can say at the present time is the apartment that is provided.,"PS has forgotten that it is us in the field that put the paychecks on the desk. I have been a property manager for a very long time. I have seen many changes in policy many I do not agree with. In the years I have been with PS I have had at least 15 Regional Managers. I do not agree with all the scripts we are suppose to memorize word for word. The customer has no idea what the next line is suppose to be. Property Managers are the ones who deal with the customers on a daily basis. The rent increases that are being given to current tenants is insane. Especially when the going price is lower than current market value. How can you raise rent on people who are paying at least 40 percent higher then the current value. Tenants complain about the increases which seem to be every six months lately. Your raising rent and nothing is getting done at the properties. And when I say nothing I mean nothing. It is like pulling teeth to get anything done. Repairs that should be done within 24 hours do not get done until months later. I have no idea why I even have the title of Property Manager when I do not manage anything anymore. I cannot call a vendor to get any repairs done that need to be done. I have to use my personal cell phone to take pictures and send them to my DM. I did not realize that PS pays my phone bill. Speaking of MY cell phone now I am being told that I need to give the customers MY phone to do a social media review in my office. I have had it with this new so called policy. I have been told that if I do not get a certain amount of reviews that I could be fired. I would love for that to happen. I think the court system would love to know that I am suppose to use MY phone to have my tenants do a review for me. If PS wants this done so badly then they need to provide a laptop in our offices for customers and tenants to use. PS expects the reservations that are sent to our computers be captured within the first 15 minutes of receiving it. Well that's kind of hard to do sometimes when all of our maintenance workers were fired almost 2 years ago now. It is up to the PM to have all units rent ready. So if you have say 15 vacates at the end of the month they need to be rent ready immediately. How is it possible for us to be able to clean the units plus keep up with the property appearance when we have to be constantly watching our computers too. Its impossible!!! Then when we are outside cleaning because we have no one else to help us the customers get mad because no one is in the office. I have no one who helps me at my property. PM's are now also suppose to be able to rake leaves, shovel snow, change lights, fix drywall, toilets and be in control of pest control. I use to love my job but now I dread going into my office because there is so much pressure on us to know a script keep a goal board that no one ever looks at. Its a waste of paper. Not once has any upper management ever looked at my goal board. You can get all the numbers and percentages by looking at the management summary. We use to get better bonuses 10 years ago then we do now. But we have many more job duties now and the bonuses are paid annually. And the memo last year was that 40 percent of managers should qualify for the bonus. This year it has moved up to 60 percent of managers should qualify. Are you kidding me? If I owned a company I would be embarrassed to send that out to my employees. PM's are responsible for everything at their property and you are going to give us an annual bonus. While the DM's are getting a quarterly bonus because of the things we are doing. All we are doing is putting money in upper management pockets. I went 8 years without a raise at all. I bring in my entire salary for the entire year the first 2 days of each month here at my location. Plus on top of that we who live on the premises have to pay for our storage units if we have one. I will not say how many years that was part of my compensation but it was a long time. The rent on that is literally half of my paycheck now! When I was hired my job description was not to bad but now my duties have more than tripled and what do I get NOTHING except a hard time from upper management. I would love for a DM, RM or even a Divisional Manager to come work an office for 2 weeks. They would not be able to do it. I would bet money on that!! I think they should know first hand how much a PM has to do on a daily basis. Sometimes I do wonder if the Corporate Office knows how the field employees are being treated. I have been screamed at and belittled in my office in front of customers and co-workers. My job is threatened I would say at least monthly lately. I take pride in the work that I do and I know all of my tenants by name and I also know their unit numbers. If not for my tenants I do not think that I would still be here. I am always getting repeat customers. This year alone I would say I have had 15 former tenants come back and rent with me. PM's get to know their tenants and now if a tenant gets behind in rent or fees they are going to auction if their account is not paid in full. We use to have some say so in the auctions now we have none. I do have tenants that keep in touch with me on a weekly basis to keep me posted on their situation but now all I can tell them is that if it is not paid in full by the sale date it will be auctioned. I can understand that if the customer calls the day of the sale or even the day before but when you have a tenant who constantly stays in contact with you they are still going to be sold. It seems that we have lost having any sympathy for anyone. I just don't understand anymore. I do understand that this is a business but what is the big deal of giving someone an extra 30 days to try and get caught up before you sell them at auction. Some of the people who are up for auction end up drowning in the fees. The fees are outrageous. Some of the late fees are up to $100 a month. 20 percent of the rent. So if your rent is $400 a month and you are late your late fee is $80. Come on really that's crazy. It should be illegal. I'm not bashing all of PS upper management and I really don't think that Ron Havner has any clue what is going on in the field. I also understand that numbers are very important to the company and I do my part to get the numbers that they expect. Very rarely do I not meet the expectations for each month. I work very hard to keep my delinquency low, merchandise sales up, insurance and lock percentage up to the best of my ability. My occupancy has never been as low as it is at the present time in over 6 years. That is due to the current rental prices and the rent increases that existing tenants are getting. I have had a lot of long term good paying tenants move within the last year due to rent increases. People are starting to shop around for better prices even if they have to go farther to rent. I really think we need to look at the long term tenants and stop raising their rent. They have been here for years and always pay on time. Policy years ago was that they were guaranteed the price for at least a year now you cant even say 6 months.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
An nihilistic business model.,1.0,"May 20, 2014","The job is not going anywhere; being relieved of your position almost takes effort. There's a flat demand curve. When the economy is good, people need storage to move to their new jobs or remodel their homes. When it's lousy, the folks being evicted need somewhere to put things. The hours are short and largely in keeping with a standard business window, so mornings are not too early and you still have an evening. If you show up wearing pants and sober enough to walk, the job is yours.","The pay is atrocious. I left because, by company policy, staff cannot be promoted above the Property Manager level. District Managers and above are recruited entirely from outside the company. Corporate manipulates the bonus structure to create a cascading series of pay cuts directed primarily at the highest-performing members of the ground crew. Being advanced to Property Manager from Relief Manager does not involve a raise; you are volunteered to be on call and you are given added restrictions to your schedule by accepting this position. The sales and marketing aspect of the business is clearly designed on the assumption that the company is hiring anyone with a heartbeat (sales scripting is mandatory is clearly written at about the third-grade level). District Managers are under such perpetual scrutiny that the management climate forces an antagonistic approach; the best DMs I worked with quit or got fired for, essentially, failure to demonstrate that the rank-and-file were being properly micromanaged into complete despair. The entry-level position with Public Storage is only suitable if you are otherwise unemployed or if you have never had a job and want to be able to put ""manager"" on your resume.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Underappreciated,1.0,"May 23, 2015","-Nice for a young person, with no work experience. - People who worked previously in fast food industry ( usually make the best employees, since they make more than minimum wage.)","-Scripts -Secret shops (ppl higher up making sure your following protocol) -Micromanaged -Poor pay -DMs have favorites -Collection/Auction Calls -Greed -SELL, SELL, SELL! (lock,insurance,merch) This company put a very bad taste in my mouth. I thought highly of PS years ago, but now it's time to move on. Its funny how people that don't work in the store, make all the decisions. One day we're following this policy and 3 months later there's a new policy that is put into place. This company is so greedy when it comes to revenue. If a customer makes a reservation that is unconfirmed, then within 24 hours it goes to advance booking...meaning that a walk in customer could rent the space, even though a reservation has been made. Do you know how many people get agressive? And guess who has to deal with the wrath of an angry customer every single day, but I dont make a single policy? ME We are supposed to tell the customer 'we can hold the price for you but the space isn't guaranteed.' Customer: Then what the was the point of making the reservation? If you don't believe me go to public storage.com right now and make a reservation and don't confirm it. you will receive a voice message and email within 24 hours. It's sad that companies like PS forget about the little man. The one that is actually doing all the work. The one that deals with customers on a daily basis... Face to face, not only by phone. Half the stuff in the office or on the property do not work. It shouldn't take days to get the AC or heat fixed. You want me to do all this work but I'm burning up or freezing to death. You're constantly going to be cleaning up after dirty tenants. I've had a customer that defecate all over the floor/walls. I've had tenants leave food in their units. I've had people leave abandoned goods. Then some tenants will leave the unit full of trash but we can't charge them, if it can fit in the dumpster. So guess who has to clean up someone else's mess...ME! The icing on the cake, is no growth or advancement within the company. The highest position that a property manager can earn is a KTP. The KTP is pretty much the trainer. He/she train's new property managers and the district managers. Yea, KTPs train the boss. The property manager could be with public storage for 15 years and will never be anything higher than a KTP. They will never ever be a district manager, they only hire district managers from outside sources. It would make more sense to hire a KTP as the district manager, especially since they know everything. They don't have to go through the training process, because they already know the basics. Public Storage doesnt care if you have a undergraduates degree, a masters degree, or doctorate... if you are a property manager that's exactly what you'll be. For example, If you've been with PS for seven years and earned your graduates degree (within that seven year span) PS will not increase salary or job title. Most companies look for a loyal employees, but not PS. And then they wonder why the turnover rate is so high.

relief manager,1.0,"Jun 9, 2015",The only pro that Public Storage has working for them IF any would be the decent hours.,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. I wish I would have known what I was getting myself into. Your job is based solely on numbers, how much merchandise you sell how many Google reviews you can get etc and if you don't reach what they consider ""acceptable"" you basically get treated like a crappy employee. Every single part of the job is based off of a script and you have to follow the script word for word, regardless that we sound stupid and robotic, if you can't do the scripts your fired. They have regional managers who essentially bully their employees because they know they can get away with it. Unreliable district managers who are no where to be found when the screaming customer comes in but they are there when its time to take credit for how great the property looks or how many units are occupied etc. They also don't tell you when you get hired that you will be out pulling weeds picking up dirty diapers condoms boxes of ground beef moving, furniture out of vacant units because they are too cheap to pay for a haul, scrubbing the doors of every unit on the property so they can be dust free, killing wasps bees etc scrubbing feces off of the walls in the bathrooms all in 95 degree FL heat Or that the PTO hours that you earn can ever add up because god forbid you have a flat tire or a doctors appointment and you are running late, they just use all of the PTO time that you have so when it comes time to request a day off because you actually have a life, they deny it because you don't have any PTO. This is a company that has such a horrible turnover rate simply because they won't treat their employees with any respect, they mislead their customers and the store level employees have to catch the back end of it and to make it worse they only want to pay $9.00 an hour. I would never in my life recommend this company to anyone.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

The DMs, senior DMs, and RMs were awful people. All they cared about were sales numbers. They didn't see their PMs and RMs as people and definitely didn't see the customers as people. They would threaten to fire you if your numbers weren't at their ridiculously unrealistic goals. They would not listen to your point of view when you explained why reaching that goal at your store was IMPOSSIBLE, they just spouted more BS about how you must not be following the sales scripts. You had to work every holiday except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years. You pretty much could not take off any days because there weren't enough Relief Managers to cover stores if someone was out sick. I had to work sick tons of times because they wouldn't let me call off. You could only get an annual raise if you met their sales goals consistently.

Not exactly a ringing endorsement for what lies ahead. You'll spend a few hours a day making collections calls to the same customers literally every other day. You're forced to lie to each customer about insurance and how ""its required per your rental agreement"". Support from management is non existent. In the month I was there I emailed and spoke to management in person about when my public storage polo and jacket would arrive. The email was ignored and the in person request were shrugged off. This left me in my street clothes looking very unprofessional. 3 days after I quit I received a call from management to do a post mortem. I explained that I felt no support from the higher ups. instead if taking that in, he kept try to throw my trainer under the bus by asking if something went wrong during training. I assured him that my trainer was great but, it fell on deaf ears as he kept insisting I blame someone by name. Management will shuffle your schedule around to keep certain employees who don't get along separated, instead of trying to address the issue. This creates a toxic culture filled with back stabbing and personal insults. It also lets employees think they can do what they want, when they want. This includes but is not limited to; closing the store to run around town taking care of personal business while on the clock. Your kid is getting out of school early today? Great!

There really isn't much else.,"Where to even begin? - Public Storage demands that its managers sell merchandise with every move in but offers no incentive whatsoever. The only reason to do so is to avoid being ridiculed in an email to all your peers. This causes very low morale at times. - Should you decide to work here, the Public Storage call center will become the bane of your existence. They are required to tell customers that the move in is $23($1 first month's rent + $22 admin fee). However, they fail to tell the customer that lock and insurance are a requirement which brings the total cost to $54 and some change. This causes a lot of unnecessary conflict with the customer. - Even though customers aren't technically required to buy a lock or insurance through Public Storage, managers are taught to lie and tell customers that they are. - Pay is abysmal and the work load can be heavy. Managers are required to maintain almost everything on the property and barely make more than minimum wage in return. - It's pretty obvious that most of the people in the corporate office have never actually worked in a property because they come up with schemes that make no sense whatsoever. - Repairs are sometimes nonexistent. Public Storage works with an outside maintenance company for repairs. It can sometimes take months or even years to get something repaired. Public Storage cuts so many and is so cheap that they will only repair something if they've been badgered enough about it. They make so much money annually but it all goes into the pockets of the corporate workers and doesn't go toward making properties functional. As a result, I'm fairly positive that a lot of things aren't even up to code. - There is virtually no way to move up in this company. For all the higher up jobs, the company hires people outside of the company. - Very few people are hired so you can expect to be asked to work on most of your days off.

Of course, there's no lock or insurance on that second rental.

The truth about this garbage company,1.0,"Jun 24, 2019",You don't have to work nights and you get some insurance. That's it.,"Working at Public Storage is one of the worst jobs I have had. You will often work single staffed at properties with over 1000 tenants renting. The properties are poorly maintained and when issues like floods, leaks, rodents, wall repairs happen they take forever to fix. It can take months or even years to get lights fixed at properties. One property it took over a year to get lights fixed on a floor of a building with entire hallways of lights out where people were renting. This company is unethical and makes you scam customers into buying overpriced merchandise and worthless insurance when renting units to them. While working you will get complaints from customers multiple times a week or even daily. You will have people screaming at you and threatening physical harm upon you. Oh and about the selling... You get no commission for selling and you start off at minimum wage with no raises ever. There is no promotion to a district manager from within you must apply for it from outside the company which is bad. So you can never ever advance to a district manager from within the company. A property manager is the highest you can be promoted to. You also must work weekends no matter what. Everything on the property from cleaning, reading legal documents to customers, doing bank deposits, dealing with every customer that needs help, doing lock checks where you have to check every unit on the property must be done single staffed by yourself. Overall, Public Storage is an awful company that treats employees and customers poorly. My only good things I can say are that you don't have to work nights, you get some insurance and that's about it as far as working for this company.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Upper management seems to have forgotten who makes the money for them,1.0,"Jan 10, 2011",The only pro that I have seen in this job is that there are no nights and you are off every Sunday as a property manager. This company is a good stepping stone since everyone who is hired is a manager no matter their level of competency.,"1. Raises are very small (10 -25cents per hour max) if you get one at all. 2. Hourly pay rate is very small considering all of the duties that you are expected to perform. 3. Public Storage offers no advancement beyond the level of property manager. 4. They constantly change policies and procedures without informing everyone. 5. You have to work every Saturday. 6. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years are the only holidays that you will get. 7. They are CHEAP and constantly cut the bonus structure, salaries and hours without warning. 8. They do make necessary repairs or handle other issues in a timely manner. 9. On a corporate level they simply do not care about you. They are greedy and are only worried about their bottom line. 10. There is no real recognition for a job well done. They really focus on the negative. Overall, this is a very negative work environment. Morale is extremely low among the property level staff. Property managers are the only employees who are held accountable for anything. Other employees can get away with doing little or no work, habitually showing up late or calling in frequently. There is no recourse for this because the district manager does not hold everyone accountable and only cares that the work is getting done without caring who is performing the bulk of it.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

The Poor Get Poorer.....,1.0,"Dec 1, 2013",No pros other than the fact that working nights is not a requirement.,"Within the past 5 years of my employment here at Public Storage on the East Coast; Public Storage has reduced Paid Time Off hours for Store Managers and Relief Managers... raised our insurance... and year by year reduced both the potential for and amount paid in ""bonuses"". 4 years ago we had the potential to make $800 per quarter totalling $3200 per year in bonus pay. 3 years ago it was reduced to bi-monthly bonus pay up to $250. 2 years ago it left you the potential to make up to approximately $100 per month. And this past year along with our PTO hours being reduced; we were informed that up to only 40% of field employees would receive ANY bonus at all with the top amount being $3000 at the end of a full calander year. A bonus that only 10% of employees in a region of hundreds would receive. All of this while ""upper management"" receives GAURANTEED bonus money based off the numbers that the field employees achieve. This is likely why you see so many ""positive reviews"" from the district and regional managers on this site. By the way; there is NO promoting from within! So while other people with little to no experience in this business will soon be Your BOSS...you will be stuck at the position you are hired at until the end of time. Forgot to mention; the company has decided to ""do away"" with annual raises (which were literally pennies on the dollar anyway) until they figure out if its ""in the budget""! Lol. We are talking about a Multics billion dollar company who ALREADY underpays its front line ; has reduced Pto; and has reduced bonus payouts to nearly nothing. Yet somehow they're not sure that raises are ""in the budget"".

"The majority of the reviews can't be real, or are from people in Corporate getting paid to lie to the masses",1.0,"Dec 23, 2013","Not really that many. They try to sell this place as a good resume' builer, as a place to grow and develop your career. In reality it is none of these (more in the cons field) Some of the co-workers were great bright people. But most were not. OH YEA... you get to drive a golf cart...","Pretty much the entire job... It's hard to figure out where to start really. The pay is HORRIBLE, I mean seriously, I just saw that Mighty Fine (a hamburger joint) is paying almost twice what a Property Manager that lives on site makes ($7.50/hr) here in Austin, TX. There is no room to advance past Property Manager. You start as a Relief Manager. There really isn't a difference between the two anyhow. Except as a PM you don't have to bounce all around town on different days of the week to cover for people. When you get the PM position, if the on-site apartment is available then they will pressure you like crazy to live there. For a few reasons, the first is they want someone in that space because they are paying for it. The second is because they will bump you down to nearly minimum wage (around $7.50/hr). I kind of understand all of this, but what happens is you get stuck in the job with nowhere to go. You are living on the property that your boss owns basically, making nothing. You can't save to live off-site because you don't get paid enough. If you go to another job to make money, you won't have a place to live anymore. I can't tell you how many people I worked with that I truly felt bad for because they either had zero drive to do anything more with their lives, or they truly wanted to but the conditions that this company creates for it's employees prevented it from happening. You can get promoted to the KTP, or Key Training Professional, which means you will train all the new hires. I am pretty sure they make about $1/hr more than other people. When your co-workers are bad, they are REALLY bad. I had some of mine stalking my wife on Facebook. By looking me up, and then befriending her only and sending her inappropriate messages. They stole from me, they lied about my work and tried to get threatening with me. Luckily I am not a scrawny scared of his own shadow type of guy and managed to get a lot of these things squashed, because management couldn't have cared less. Management for the most part doesn't care. They want you to spit out their ridiculous robotic scripts, and lie to people about the ""legal requirement to insure your storage goods"" or try to sell someone a lock for $20.00 that you can get at Wal-Mart for less than $10 (same type of disc lock). This is to the point that they will expect you to turn away a move-in if they don't purchase these upgrades. Of course they won't openly admit that, but if you want to keep your job, and keep your numbers from looking bad you will end up doing this. You have to deal with the scum of the earth, when it comes to customers (granted not all of them, but some of them are wastes of flesh.) I literally had a customer drop a deuce in front of their storage unit after vacating it. Guess who was expected to clean it? I was. The customer that brought it to my attention, because it happened between one of my two property check apologized to me that I had to deal with that stuff. Honestly, all in all, this job is what I expected it to be. But I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. Even as an alternative to working in a fast food place. I realize this may sound like a disgruntled employee. I am really not, it's been about 3 years since I worked there. And I have a MUCH better job, in the field that I specialize in. So I am really not angry anymore. BUT, I just felt that there were a lot of overly positive reviews coming from a place that really doesn't care about the little guy, and it not interested in the development of their field agents in any way.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
Property manager,1.0,"Dec 18, 2017",No On site supervisor. No micromanagement,"Too many to count but here are some of the basics that I went through. No flexibility as far as schedule, which can be a con for some more than others. ALOT of sexual misconduct in my district. Low pay although I started as a relief and got promoted to a property manager, but that’s as far as promotion goes for you. If you want to go further you have to quit and reapply (ridiculous). A lot of physical work around the property, cleaning units (sometimes heavy furniture) pulling weeds outside or around property. Poor camera systems, some did not work at all. They love you if you have a car (I work in New York) as they will have you drive from property to property based off of their needs. Too many managers in upper management. You’ll have a DM, an RM and so and so forth, so that if you ever make it to property manager you have no real authority to make decisions for your property. Nothing EVER gets fixed. Units constantly broken into and then the reliefs and PMs have to deal with unsatisfied customers. This company makes millions of dollars but rarely wants to let any money slide by them. Too cheap to fix things but they want us to constantly lie to customers about the units that they are renting. Forced to sells merchandise and I’d yoy don’t you constantly feel like your job is on the line if number are poor. Overall this is a job that should be taken if you just need some thing for a short time. Not a career based job whatsoever. Get in and get out or don’t get in at all. I will say that this company could care so little about its customers or employees that you can get away with almost anything as far as giving terrible customer service.

Run!,1.0,"Jun 18, 2022",They offer a reasonable 401k program and decent benefits.,"I worked for this company as a resident property manager. I was provided an apartment that was never maintained by facilities and I along with other employees, constantly had the apartment thrown in my face if sales numbers didn't meet their outlandish quota. My apartment never had carpets or floors replaced prior to moving in and were disgusting. I was promised they would replace them shortly after moving in, they never did.. they do not feel they should follow simple housing codes. Management loves to take advantage of people who are unknowledgable of their rights as a tenant or an employee. The pay is not competitive to other storage locations within the area. You are expected to wear too many hats and manage multiple stores due to short staffing. Management belittled you and used scare tactics to push sales numbers. They hired unlicensed companies to complete maintenance work. While living onsite they did a ""property of tomorrow"" upgrade in the office that was connected to my apartment and put me in a temporary box with the door facing the gate. I was told this was only to last a week, maybe 2. Everytime I stepped outside of the office I risked getting hit by a car. They did not hire a contractor that was properly licensed to be completing the work required and did not pull permits. When I voiced my fear of the office catching fire due to the overloaded and outdated electrical panel, facilities told me ""you're there to rent storage units"". I then realized they did not care about my safety, my family's or my customer's safety.. I was left in the temp office for over 6 months due to a complaint being filed with the city because no permits were pulled. Mind you, I was pregnant through the entire experience. I quit 2 weeks after returning from maternity leave. They do not care about safety or security for their employees, let alone their customers. I had threats made against me my customers because of immoral business practices that we were forced to enforce! I never felt safe the entire time I worked there. You give up all of your privacy when you live on site. The training sucks. You are sent out knowing very little and they hire irresponsible kids. When you go to management about other employees you are told to just deal with it and expected to clean up after the relief managers' mistakes. There is a lot of favoritism. Through the years I witnessed other employees steal, come to work under the influence, verbally assault others and management does nothing about it.. even when it's been reported to HR it all gets swept under the rug and you are labeled as ""trouble"" for doing your dudiligence to report the issues as you are told to do through the code of conduct you sign every year. Do not work for this company unless you want to be treated like scum every day. The pay is not worth any of the crap situations you will have to endure. I promise the ""free apartment"" they will dangle over your head is never worth the mental anguish you will endure every day and the lack of privacy. You will have people banging on your kid's bedroom window in the middle of the night because they're above following simple rules like access hours and feel entitled to being served at every dying moment. You'll miss out on time with your kids and family because you're forced to work most major holidays. You will not be provided with the bare necessities to complete your day to day job then asked why a, b or c is not completed. You'll be treated like you're stupid every day you clock in.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

They've ""blacked out"" several weeks where employees cannot use personal time. The company's we care slogan is totally bogus. Customers are deceived and tricked.

Like giving units that don't sell at auction to her friends. Funny I thought we were suppose to throw everything in the dumpster. I could go on and on about how horrible this company is.

Terrible management policies,1.0,"Sep 2, 2016",You generally work alone or with 1-2 co-workers Decent work life balance Medical benefits and 401k,"I can really only speak about my experience as a field employee with Public Storage but after working here for over 2 years and seeing the way the upper management runs things, I can only assume it just as bad in other departments. To anyone looking at becoming either a relief or property manager for Public Storage please be wary. First off, there is no room for advancement as a field employee. You could become a property manager and possibly get an on site apartment but that is as high as you will ever go. Public Storage DOES NOT promote higher than the property manager position but they will attempt to give you extra work with no pay raise once you become more experienced. Because field employees are not promoted to the corporate side of this business, the managers are MASSIVELY DISCONNECTED with the employees they are managing. As a field employee you report directly to a DM(District Manager) who has never actually done your job full time. The DMs are told by the RMs(Regional Manager) how to manage us field employees. Well the RMs have never done this job either and are rarely out in the field so they are even more disconnected. Now this wouldn't be so bad except that Public Storage upper management evaluates your performance based almost solely on numbers and metrics. We are told to follow these absolutely robotic and inhuman scripts for just about every interaction we could have with a customer. These scripts are written by someone in corporate who has also never done this job. The point of the scripts is to streamline the service to help us meet certain numbers each month in several different categories such as move-ins, lock sales, insurance sign ups, and merchandise sales to name only a few. But the scripts really just make us sound like the robots and makes the entire interaction terribly awkward. Then, if you don't meet the numbers they expect, you just get told that you must not be following the scripts well enough. Plus most of these categories are not even within our control and trying to influence customers to buy packing supplies or locks can only get even the best salesman so far. But you'll still reprimanded for not meeting your numbers anyway! On top of having to manage reservations, maintain the cleanliness of the property and do collections, this can become a bit of a stressful job. In the end Public Storage is asking A LOT more from us field employees than what we are paid for and all incentive to work as hard as upper managements wants to get the job done is completely removed. Why would I keep working my butt off when I have no other room for advancement and I'm barely getting paid over minimum wage? I would highly advise anyone thinking of working for this company to only use it as a place holder job until you find something better.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Basically an under paid janitor,1.0,"Nov 5, 2022",N.O.N.E at all what so ever,"Stores have been understaffed for over a year. Properties with 800 - 1200 units are single staffed constantly. Other stores only half day with one person splitting their time running between stores or stores not opened at all. The supervisor has you punch in at the 1st store then go to the 2nd store so it looks like all the stores are open. The amount of work needed to be done is never going to be completed with only one person there all day. Try putting in for PTO, HAH! You're told you need to be a team player and shorten the requested time. PTO is time that the company gives you in accordance with your length of time on the job. More time in, means more PTO. We are allowed and encouraged by Corporate to take that time off. Only to be denied or asked to shorten it because we are short staffed. Solution is HIRE PEOPLE ! Someone was not allowed time off for a family wedding and the bride and groom had family coming in from several states. They only had the day of the wedding off and had to be in the next day. Another property had to work while they had COVID!! The supervisor said we don't have enough people to cover so they had to work and just tell reservations to do the E Rental. The door signage is confusing to the customers. It says ""We're Open"" BUT WE AREN'T !! They want the customer to scan the QRC and do it online. We are not in the office because it's either closed or we are outside on the property washing doors and mopping hallways. The customer doesn't know if we will be back in 10 minutes or not at all. The customers would prefer to have us in the store. Not everyone does everything online and fewer people don't have a clue what a QRC is! The company would rather have us be janitors than someone taking care of the customers. Store level employees cannot plan anything outside of work because the supervisors can't get a schedule out in a timely manner. They are constantly changing peoples days off after they have had the same days off for years. Supervisors play favorites and it's very obvious. They have other employees that roll their eyes when they ask them to do something and they don't do it. The supervisor will ask someone else. They have no clue how this business works. They keep saying ""Well when I was at XYZ Big box store we did this. I'm sorry, we are no longer at XYZ Big box store, this is a totally different business, Another manager reported that a sliding glass door was off track and needed repair. The supervisor told the manager that they should be able to nudge and knock the door back into place. No one is knocking any doors back into place. Not any 300lb glass door! If they did, and got hurt and or broke the door, They would have been fired. No one wants to get hurt because the supervisor thinks it can be done. They try to do repairs themselves to avoid paying vendors, only having to call a vendor because they are not a handy man and botched it up.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

(Expects you to eliminate your personal life for the company) - Expects you to drive to numerous locations with out compensating for mileage no matter the distance. - Changes the bonus system when suitable for them, also it is unattainable. - Does not have an anonymous compliance department even though they say it is anonymous . - makes you work overtime but no overtime pay (asks you to work extra hours but tells you to eliminate hours from a different day so there isn't over 40 hours on you time by the end of the week or pushes your days off to the end of the week and make you work a 7 day stretch) - the over turn rate between relief and property manages are ridiculous which ends up hurting the rest of the district when it boils down to coverage (which the lack of coverage is already existing) - single coverage is majority of the work week (normally) and could even be the entire work week (expects you to do the work of 2 people by yourself). - getting an approval to get something fixed in THEIR facility is like pulling teeth and even if it is approved, the job is less then inadequate so the object breaks down in less than a week. - ridiculously micro-managed but can't provide us with updated technology.

Worst job I have had.,1.0,"Oct 17, 2013",Great co-workers and you learn how to organize rooms.,"So many downsides I don't know where to start. SCRIPTS. They give new scripts every month and they all sound like something that was randomly put together by someone with less social skills then a newly made robot. Promotions are nonexistent in this company. They would rather bring a person from another company or another state to be the DM or RM. The only care they have is to the stockbrokers. They tell you that when the performance reviews come out no one is going to get a 5. So why do they even have it on the review sheet to begin with. They combined sick and vacation days together and black out days to keep people stuck at work. You have put to vacation time in the system by a month or longer or you will not get the time off. Birthdays or sickness they do not care you are stuck at work. The properties are falling apart. They charge people premium prices but if something breaks at the facility it will stay broken for at least 6 months because they put a freeze on all repairs without their consent. When the customers call the DM, RM, or corporate about the broken doors, insulation, or gates, corporate blames you for them calling. That right, Corporate blames the relief and property managers for the customers calling about their unit and goods damage, instead of calling the vendors to fix the problems and expects you to try and fix the issue knowing that that they will not pay workman comp if you get hurt. The wildlife that is at the properties is another problem. Spiders, Roaches, and rats are as regular as the customers. I lost out on a rental once because a rat ran out of the unit when I opened the door. The biggest step on their on the PM and RM is the waste that they call the bonus program. Every year it gets worse and worse. They rose the best rewards to 95% and when stores began to reach those goals. The bonus amount reduced and it went from a monthly to an annually program. The DM's and RM's keep nothing to themselves. If they know something everyone knows. It doesn't matter if the information is personal all of the company knows. No advancement, no loyalty, no bonuses. PS was a decent place to work before the sin of GREED took over. Senior management knows people will always need storage so they will only get worse from here.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
Its a job......that's it!,1.0,"Nov 9, 2013","Working alone, interacting with customers/ new people.","There are so many....first of all the company does not care about you as a person they only care about their numbers......I got written up because I called into work twice in a month for being sick and having a sick child that I could not send to school or daycare let alone try and get myself up and moving. They want us to sell merchandise which is way overpriced and the customers know this and have stated that they will buy boxes down the street. The pay for what we do on a daily basis is not worth it. We are the front line of the company and basically we are treated like scum from upper management. I would like to see them do what we do everyday at the pay we make and see how they would feel. Bonuses when I started were ok they went from monthly to every three months now to yearly if you are the lucky 40% that will actually get bonuses. The DM should get to know the employees working under him and know a little about them instead of just downing the employees all the time maybe say something on the positive. Spend time with employees at every property to see what their strengths and weaknesses are. The scripts are horrible and sound rediculous when you actually use them with a customer. There are only three holidays the store is not open other than that you are required to work. Hope you don't want a big personal life working here you will not have one as you will work EVERY weekend and just about every holiday with the exception of the three that the store is closed. Nothing is ever repaired and if it is then it is literally not done correctly and needs to be repaired again about a week later. Many properties in my district do not have a working golf cart which is fine for small properties but there are quite a few large ones and asking a potential rental who may be handicapped to walk to a space a far distance away seems inappropriate and using your car and having people follow you is not much better. Property managers are asked to fix things that are broken to which may not be safe. Lack of communication between property and higher ups as well as call center. Treated poorly if you do not sell lock or insurance with every single rental....even if it is a return customer. If you are a guy do not plan on getting hired. Do not plan on having certain days off as they are never approved even if it's a medical thing. They took away PTO pretty much. ""Black out dates"" are rediculous we should be able to have a vacation in the summer with our families we are not much busier during these dates than any other time period. DM has been trained same as us but not willing to do the job we do if someone calls in or quits we are scheduled over time with out being asked.

Ron Havner. Needless stress from higher ups re: sales, maintaining scripts (never used their scripts and sold just fine, thank you very much).

The feeling of constantly harassing customers with calls; either reservation, delinquency, or welcome calls. Not evicting problem customers (customers dangerous to employees or other customers, conducting illegal operations on site, customers who frequently go in to lien or auction). Feeling like you could be held up and shot at any time at certain properties and no real precautions to alleviate that threat at those properties. Forcing customers in to purchasing a lock and insurance. Always unsure if person working property the day before actually did anything. Poor work/life balance for property managers as they're required to work where they live and if they quit or get terminated, they have an extremely short amount of time (about 48 hours) to find a new place and move out.

If I knew then what I know now! Not disgruntled just truthful,1.0,"Apr 15, 2018",Late morning start time allows for better commute & time to send kids off to school. On-site residences are convenient.,"Some of these properties are run down & neglected. All responsibility falls onto the on-site managers who barely have enough supplies, equipment or safety items to keep the places comfortably operational, so they spend out of their own pockets for office & cleaning supplies. At some locations there are missing or broken carts & elevator & bathroom problems, poor lighting in hallways which could become hazardous situations for customers and staff. The corporation leverages the on-site staff to add extra duties, custodial, janitorial & maintence because of their on-site residences plus sometimes dispatching those property managers to other locations specifically to clean & fix ‘as needed. It seems to me that those on-site PMs are at a disadvantage to complain or decline the management orders. This corporation is very profitable yet pays barely minimum wage, the benefits are expensive compared to the wages. There have been property managers that had to seek public services for their medical needs. Raises are not given to property managers (there were in past but no longer exist) & there are no additional compensation incentives. Some PMs who have worked 5-10 years are making 50 cents more than a new hire. I have been told that some onsite residences are also neglected & many property managers make household repairs themselves. Customer storage rental fees are increased on average every 6 mo & customers are told the increases are for upkeep costs...the increases are not reinvested into the properties...those profits are kept at executive level bonuses. When I asked, I was told there is a compliance hotline but altho’ it’s supposed to be anonymous, specific questions can reveal the source of the complaint with subsequent consequences.

Dead end job...,1.0,"Dec 2, 2013",There isn't someone looking over your shoulder constantly.,"Your District Managers make up for the time they weren't there to look over your shoulder constantly when they visit your. COMPLETE MICRO-MANAGEMENT at every level. They put into effect a ""recertification program"" which they implement whenever they decide it's time to rehearse scripts again after you've already passed your probationary period. Recertification, implying that you could lose your job if you don't remember their constantly changing scripts word for word. And there are at least 10 scripts and growing. Say the scripts verbatim, and I guarantee they'll still find fault. It's how you said it, it wasn't said in your own words, ...etc..etc.. Then you do it they way they suggested you tweak the scripts, and next time they ask you, you do it their way, and they contradict ever having told you to say it that way. So guess what, you're wrong again! There goes your performance review! Yes, I said rehearse. They love SCIPTS. They have one for just about every human interaction you have with any customer and love to change the scripts or add new ones all the time. The district managers are on complete power trips and it's all about who they like. If they don't like you, they use ""at will employment"" and a casual grey matter excuse to get rid of you. That's how they did me. I was written up several times for things I thought would benefit the properties I was working at. Why? Because I didn't ask permission from my manager first. Yes, that's why I no longer work there. I was written up for doing something my district manager told me to do, then I was written up for not asking permission to do something positive for the property that actually SAVED the company money and time!

I was told I only had to work two stores that were close to me but after I took the job they started making me do 80 mile commutes EVERY DAY. You cant drive that far off of the very low money that you make ...You'll be a slave to this company. The bonus scale changed from weekly, to monthly, to quarterly now to YEARLY ! They have this because of such a high turn-over rate because no-one wants to stay when they get suckered into this job. On top of that when you're ready for your bonus management try to cut it down as low as possible so that THEY can get a bigger bonus. Literally all the hard work that property managers and relief managers do the higher ups ( district manager, regional manager etc.) are the ones who get the bonus for it !

Headache with Lies used for Asprin,1.0,"Dec 27, 2013","Free apartment with electricity included, you get to work alone","I worked for PS from 2009-2011, and I quickly became a manager at the Red Bank location just outside of Chattanooga. At first, I enjoyed the job until the DM changed. They brought in a guy who cared more about respect than the job being done right. He demanded respect, but did nothing at all to earn it. But, he gave you none in return. The scripts were ridiculous. They made you look like an idiot, and worse, they come off as talking down to the customer and insulting their intelligence. Personally, if someone talked to me like in those scripts, I would turn around and walk away. I remember one time, they were trying to increase the sales of their overpriced locks, so they made it a requirement to buy TWO locks. This is part of the script basically...Cust: I brought a lock. PS: Good! You only need one more. Cust: Why do I need 2? PS: To maximize security. Cust: Do you have alot of break ins? (this next part is amazing) PS: I'm glad you asked that. It seems like security is important to you. It is to us too. We do our part by having coded gate entry and security cameras. We ask that you do your part by purchasing these 2 locks. Talk about condescension. The script didn't even answer the customer's question! The scripts constantly changed too. It seems like they hired a bunch of college kids who had never set on a property to write the scripts. I see alot of people here mentioning the bonuses being taken. Did you ever notice that each time the bonuses were reduced or made even harder to obtain, a week or to before it happened, there would be an email from corporate telling us to welcome so in so, the head of some new department of whatever? How do you think those people get paid? Not to mention the so called 'safety manager.' This guy travels from city to city investigating the properties. He spends 10-15 minutes at each property, asking the property managers how to raise a door, and other common sense things like that. He then asks you what the 'safety topic' is for that month, and looks over your 'safety binder,' which never changes year to year. All they do is send you another flyer with the topic on it, with the current year's date on it. Now, I want THAT job. Getting paid to travel the country, complete with hotel and meals paid too, and all you have to do is annoy people for a few minutes a day? Sign me up!! And, I imagine its a pretty lucrative salary too! I'm going to go back to the upper management here. I mentioned the new guy I worked for. But his boss thought he was a drill instructor. This next segment illustrated the lack of communication and the low regard that upper management has for the property managers...One time, the regional manager came in, and I had locks in 2 different places behind the counter. He told me to get rid of one of the locations. I did, and the next time he came in, he told me that I disobeyed him, saying that he told me to get rid of BOTH of them. I politely reminded him that he told me to get rid of one of them. The next day, the DM who was there for both conversations reamed me for being disrespectful to the RM. The DM also lied to keep me there. I requested a transfer to Augusta, GA. It was (supposedly) approved. We were just waiting for the property manager there to work out his notice and vacate the apartment there. But then, I made the mistake of giving a second dollar move in special to a family who already had a unit there...even though the person moving in had a different last name than the other tenant. The DM rushed to write me up, then told me that in order to transfer, you had to be writeup free for a year. I finally relocated on my own, but I found out later from a different DM that there was no such rule. He made the whole thing up just so I couldn't leave. Do yourself a favor, and look into a different storage company if you want to go that route. There are others who treat their employees much better and pay more.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

This job has taught me what I need to be successful regarding speaking with people, describing transactions and policy procedures a s well as my personal enrichment.","Unfortunately this outweighs the pros. I called my boss and told them I felt unsafe here. There are men - possibly without a home who walk around and get too close to property office front door. I work alone - no cameras, bad lighting at night and 90% off the highway where anyone can walk up and shoot you, rape or rob basically do whatever they want to you. Anyway I told him about this and he said ""call the police if they come in I can't really do anything about homeless men walking around your areas of work."" He said nothing also didn't ask about how they could improve on security. Basically meant well ya know I can't do anything and nothing will change to improve your workplace. Also the bathrooms are filthy at some locations, causing me to use my gas to drive 5 miles and find a bathroom. They know these places are unsafe and dangerous with no lighting and dark hallways. Oh and they have job fairs 247, knowing were short handed and not hiring a single person. They want you to be over qualified for poverty wages and won't hire good honest people. My current manager wouldn't have hired me. I got in a couple of yrs before he did. You get 30 minutes for lunch.

"No respect, no form of promotion.",1.0,"Feb 1, 2021",- Working alone with minimal supervision is great for introverts. - Laid back and easy work on slow days,"- Expected to do practically 4 jobs, every day, by yourself, which include leasing/administration, sales of merchandise, collections, and janitorial work of the entire property. - After 3 years working there, the only time I got a raise was when they raised the new employee rate, so the new and long time managers got paid the same. - Very little to no support form supervising managers and higher-ups. - Expected to always do extra, no matter how much extra you do, its not enough. - Expected to solve customer issues that property managers don't have the authority to solve, then when trying to escalate, supervising managers hardly ever call customers back. - Company calls consist of sitting on the phone and listening to whining about the company not making enough money from the sales of property managers. - Expected to sell merchandise with no incentive, in fact, most supervising managers get bonuses if their district does well, but the people who actually do the selling get nothing. - Property managers are treated like they are stupid, with no respect, and given no authority. - Break ins happen constantly and 9/10 times nothing is done about it. Property managers are expected to explain the situation to the customer who lost their stuff, tell the customer to call the police and then tell them to call the insurance, who won't help them most of the time either. Storage facilities are a huge target for homeless, who know that the security is lacking and never gets fixed/updated. I was told one time that as cameras break on the property, that they would not be replaced, by the time I left the company, my property had 4 cameras, one on the entrance gate, one on the exit gate, one in the office and one on the dumpster. These camera's purposes were to see who came in, see who came out, see if an employee stole money/got robbed, and fine people for getting in the dumpster. Not a single storage unit was on camera. There were no burglar alarms, broken exterior lights for over 2 years, and gates that stay stuck open for weeks before being fixed, practically inviting people to come in and steal.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

"I came, I saw, I regret...",1.0,"Sep 28, 2010",Truly interesting customers. Occasionally getting the feeling that you've helped make a life a little less stressful in some small way.,"Work environment almost celebrates the very things one would avoid (from an HR standing). HR/open door/compliance reporting is a JOKE on a good day. The grapevine is the preferred method of information gathering for important decision making. Favoritism runs rampant and is reflected in relief manager movement (or lack thereof), as well as response time to calls for assistance. I've met both great and mediocre managers. The ability is there, but given the environment, the going belief is that you need to be this terrible, abusive wretch to be successful. Some of the bullying, lying and out right mistreatment of customers (simply because) leaves me disgusted. I can go on, and on, and on, but I think you get the idea. It takes Herculean efforts to force action against the ""Preferred Few"" or the hopelessly stuck that feel they can't find work elsewhere. I would advise folks to sell, donate or throw away whatever cannot fit where you are. The sadness of ridding yourself of those items is far less than the financial and emotional cost of the treatment that I've witnessed and the cost of having them go up for sale at auction anyway.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm
"Easy, decent pay, heavy service oriented",4.0,"Aug 2, 2017","Being a Relief Manager for Public Storage is way easier than I ever thought it would be. I'd worked in retail for about 5 years prior to moving to this company and I thought that with the title ""Manager"", I was really going to be moving up in skills and pay. Reality is, everyone that works there has a ""Manager"" title. Relief Manager is the bottom tier, followed by Assistant Manager (making approximately $15/hour) and then Property Manager, (making about $16/hour). You typically work with 1-2 other people during the day. It's an easy job especially if you're decent at talking with people, cleaning and being able to fulfill basic duties. This job is also great if you like to sit in an office for the majority of your day. Most days, it feels like I get paid to sit around and wait for people to come by which isn't terrible (but boring). Overall, laid back and easy environment. All shifts are 9:30-6pm on weekdays and 9:30-5 on weekends.","I find because this business deals with people's money, customers love to verbally abuse me when they're angry (I'm used to it though. Worked 5 years in retail and customer service already!). The District Managers are REALLY focused on getting reviews for their properties which can get annoying and frustrating. I find I'm bored a lot at this job and it just doesn't stimulate me enough most days.",Public Storage,PSA,Self-storage,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Public-Storage-Reviews-E626.htm

Upper management is out of touch with the front line. No room for advancement. They hire upper management from outside the company only. Every few months there is a new gimmick on how to make the company more money. Employees on the front line are treated as inferiors instead of the assets. They will bend over backwards for customers but will not take care of their employees or properly maintain the facilities because of budgetary constraints. They are more likely to answer to stock holders than those who are running the business on the front line. The employees can become catty gossips without proper direction. It can be like working in a small town where everyone is nice to your face. The environment breeds resentment toward fellow employees instead of teamwork.

Bonuses, and slightly better-than-McDonald’s pay.","You need to have a broad range of skills - managerial, administration, customer service, janitorial, and retail - which you will need to juggle, sometimes simultaneously. You are the company’s first line of defence, so make sure you don’t drop the ball, because you will be the clients #1, and often, only target for complaints and confrontations (ranging from whining to full-on Academy Award nominee-contending meltdowns). Usually short-staffed, employees come and go, through a veritable revolving-door. Because of that, don’t expect them to love you if you need a couple of sick days. Schedules change frequently, and dramatically. You may have to work multiple locations, and adjust your working style to mesh with the local teams. As with any job, every location has a different set of personalities, so once you have one set figured out, and are able to feel comfortable, don’t get comfortable…you’ll be dropped-in with another team. The job also has heavy demand on employees to reach certain quotas every quarter, so prepare for a cold, ‘corporate panache’-laced, passive-aggressive talking-to, either through a surprise phone call, or within the 3-4+ hour monthly meetings. Sure there are bonuses and some perks including limited health and dental. But, including the bonuses, you’ll still have a hard time putting any money away.
