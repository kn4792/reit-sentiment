Do your homework.,"Both the best and worst Company I've worked for..depending on the GM. It appears GM's are NOT held accountable for for breaking employment laws or Company Policy. Several complaints have made it up the chain to the RM and Corporate HR, complaints with provable merit. All have been dismissed with retaliation following to any employee suspected of complaining. If Corporate HR ever calls my advice is to not offer any information as they are not there to help resolve the situation but to protect the GM and the RM WILL know how you commented on the issue at hand. If you have a complaint worthy of HR you need a lawyer imo, if you're a bystander support the victim but don't think HR is there to help, they are not.

I worked at Lamar for 5 years,3.0,"Dec 9, 2014",Great company the best and the largest OOH company in North America. Great Benefits great stock options.,Each office is run independently and I was bullied and sexually harassed for 5 years. I would have filed an anonymous complaint but when one did a vicious employee meeting was called and when folks left and a negative exit interviews were given regarding the GM but no recourse nothing was done. They just called GM asked if they did the things ex employee accused them of they just said no I would never and it was swept out to sea. Sad that such a great organization has weak links at the local levels and they do nothing about it. I planned to retire from Lamar but unfortunately the stress and ridicule and unfair treatment by the GM made it impossible. Lamar needs to pay attention to markets that are not growing and have abundant turn over maybe your appointed GM are making it impossible for people to do their jobs. Remember you are only as strong as your weakest link and you have a few of them at GM / VP levels that need to be disposed of like trash.,Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm

Some of the events we got to attend were fun. I had a lot of responsibility, so I felt like my work mattered","It didn't matter to management. I was constantly pitted against other employees, being told that their jobs were in jeopardy and I had only to prove myself to get a chance for promotion, then sworn to secrecy while they had those same employees train me for their own jobs. I was promised salary increases based on performance, and when goals were met, excuses were made. The GM even offered me a personal loan when I made the case for why I deserved a promised raise. The good old boys thing got REALLY old. Our office was full of cute, young women who were also extremely capable, but were treated like window dressing, being sent out drinking with the bigwigs from corporate when they came visiting. They called it a big family, but only childless young women were hired for administrative positions and those that did get pregnant never lasted more than a year or two, tops. The pay was a joke compared to the workload/responsibility and you only ever got a cost of living raise no matter how hard you worked, or didn't...unless you got promoted, and then you better shoot for the stars because once your title changes, your new salary is fixed no matter how competent you prove yourself to be.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm

I was not micromanaged at all, instead trusted to do my job.","I did not feel there was very good communication between the corporate office and our plant. There was also lack of communication within our office between Managers as well as with the employees. I did not feel that expectations were clearly identified and there was little accountability for actions. There were jokes about that 'anyone could do anything because no one gets written up anyway.' There were fellow employees that watched you tube during work hours, provided very poor customer service and there were no consequences.

The will promote their best workers without preparing them and then end up firing them because they could not do the new job. Pay increases are given to you and your coworkers equally.

As a group, we went to ball games bowling and movies together, and everyone had fun and the guys were great. The art department at the national headquarters did an outstanding job of continued training of plant artists by providing tutorials, photo and logo resources and an annual artist conference for training for various professional skills that helped all artists stay on the cutting edge of the industry. Very positive experience. I was encouraged to produce spec art to generate new sales and was paid extra for them, which was a real perk.","The pay was not outstanding, but the positives allowed for more or less a stress-free work environment for the art department.

I enjoyed my experience with a good group of fellow employees and a pleasant atmosphere, though.","Pay was very low with little opportunity for raises. Although the product we sold was billboard designs, artists who created the product the company based its fortunes on were treated with about the same sense of importance as the truck drivers and installers and treated as much less important than salesmen. That always struck me as odd. Account Executives were micromanaged and even though the economy was in a serious decline, they still had to meet last year's numbers, which was impossible.

Bad reputation in market along with terrible turnover,2.0,"Mar 15, 2012",Product strengths and cost per thousand reached.,"Incompetent sales manager with negative attitude and bad reputation throughout business community. I actually had the sales manager accompany me on sales calls every so often. My experience with how he behaved out in the field was the deciding factor for me to leave the company for a better opportunity. After seeing him treat a potential advertiser with total disrepect and then being asked not to say anything to the general manager about what happened, I knew that I wouldn't be at Lamar until retirement as I originally had planned. Did my sales manager not realize that how he treats a potential advertiser would either create good or bad word of mouth throughout the business community? Well, business owners do talk to one another and I had to go out and deal with the negative word of mouth Lamar has been receiving. Following in footsteps of 5 other AEs who left over the past 2 years. If I would have known I had to follow 5 other reps within such a short period of time, I wouldn't have taken the job as this added an obstacle to making sales. Salary and expense reimbursement could have been more substantial. After 6 months, salary is reduced by 50%, then after a year it goes to commission only. This is NOT enough time to develop a territory in which Lamar doesn't have a good reputation at all. Training should concentrate on internal procedures rather than a majority of training covering the sales process unless hiring inexperienced persons who have no prior sales experience. I felt the training was wasted time. AEs should be out selling and spending less time on clerical. In past AE positions, I always had an assistant who would deal with that end of things so I could be out selling! I was hired for my winning personality so I could go out and win over business owners and bring in revenue, not to sit at a desk.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm

"Greensboro, NC Branch overall is awesome!",4.0,"Aug 4, 2022","Good company. Greensboro Branch works 4 10hr days. They do seem to value family time but allow for overtime if you want it. Anthony is a heck of an OPS manager! He doesn't sit in office doing paperwork all the time like other OPS managers do. He goes out every day and busts his butt with the employees he supervises. Very respectable. At the same time he's sociable, understanding, but expects work. Couldn't have asked for any better. Crew I worked with was great group of guys as well...helpful, sociable, and good workers. Days when you're installing poster ads or vinyls (billboard ads), you have that independence. It's just you, your truck, and the ads you are scheduled to install that day. Great exercise since you're climbing a lot of structures. Room for advancement.","Collectively these factors lead me to finally move on from the company Tired of working in 90° heat while having to wear hard hat, long pants, and gloves while climbing and/or performing construction on structures. Worked a lot throughout my life outside in the elements and I was finally just done with it. They stress on safety being first and have measures in place to help prevent injuries/death but after few months on the job I realized there were still plenty of dangerous aspects that were obviously never going to be addressed because the only way to eliminate them is to make drastic changes that will cost them astronomically up front as well as cut into their profits for the foreseeable future. Got to the point I was unwilling to continue risking my safety. Work there and you'll see. And finally, I'm in shape. I value my overall longevity and strive to be able to get around well and be very active at least up into my 70's. I've had couple car accidents and the ligament damage and spinal compression fracture I suffered in those accidents many years ago didn't stop me. I recovered well and kept true to my workout regimen. However, after several months of performing the work this job requires, I realized that it was beginning to expose those injuries. I wanted to get out before the job started having serious effects on my body. You don't always just install ads. It involves actual construction work such as tearing down or repairing structures, as well as building new ones. All in all, long as you're a good worker and willing to endure the stress on your body, it has its perks. Though there are chances for additional certifications to increase your salary, coming in as an entry level installer you're going to be disappointed in the pay.

Your plant GM will control all, so be sure you are comfortable working closely with that person. During interview process, ask many questions about the things that are important to you. Many promises will be made. Consider them carefully and ask specific detail-oriented questions. You will experience favoritism, but if you produce, that can be to your benefit. Lastly, Lamar will protect their General Managers so be prepared for that. Poor behavior, bad business (unethical) practices and a bully mentality are just a few of the Cons experienced in my plant.

MIS Department Is A Joke,1.0,"Jul 10, 2015","The corporate headquarters is a nice building. It is a great place to work if you want to fly under the radar. As long as you come in on time, you can spend most of your day coasting. Your only other responsibility is to attend the occasional meeting to talk about the project you're supposed to be working on. This usually involves blaming others in your department, or some made-up technical issue, for things not getting done.","The MIS department is a cesspool of incompetence. Avoid at all costs if you are eager to learn or be involved with good technology. Any attempt to help them evolve past the 20th century will be shunned and you will be labeled a ""troublemaker."" At this point, instead of firing you, they will methodically bully (i.e. targeted monitoring, verbal abuse, pay disparity, etc.) you until you quit. For most people, this can go, and has gone, on for years. Even if you manage to stay in good graces, vertical movement is virtually unheard of. Promotions for developers manly come in the form of title change, but rarely ever incorporate any advance in autonomy or pay. As a whole, the office political culture is out of control. Every department head openly hates each of his counterparts, actively pitting departments against one another, just to try and score petty political points. They are all fake-smiles and handshakes in public, however. None of them will actually stand up and call the other one out because they are all complicit in playing the childish game.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm
Terrible General Management,1.0,"Apr 12, 2019","It was a job with a steady pay check, they offered health benefits a vacation time","They do not value local customers or local sales reps at all. There is always another customer out there and there are always other sales reps who will come along that they can pay less. The General Manager changed the sales reps compensation plan 6 times in one year, moving the goal post so the reps would never make their quota and he didn't have to pay them commissions.

Very Unethical and Very Unprofessional Company,1.0,"Apr 1, 2015",Job was actually good and fun. They help lots of parties at the main office in Baton Rouge and always had a keg of beer at the party. The Christmas Party was incredible.,"I worked for Lamar Advertising as a contract employee for only one year. During that time, I have never seen a more unprofessional organization. The job was really good. I enjoyed going to work daily. But, on the other side of the spectrum, Lamar employees were dictating my destiny without consulting me first on it. One employee had an issue with me. He actually worked right across from me. But, he never spoke to me one on one about the issues he had with me. Instead, he went straight to his supervisor and probably the guy that was over the department overall. He complained to them about me. In return, they spoke to me. Problem is, they never gave me any information that explained what I did or whom made the complaint because they did not want there to be issues between me and the person. So, I was told someone complained about me. But, I was never given anything to defend myself or make the situation right. Apparently, this same Lamar employee went and complained again about me, only this time, he told the boss that I ""hit” him while at work that day. The boss let me work the remainder of that day and never said one word about the complaint. I got home that night and I had a call from the staffing agency I worked for. She told me about the complaint made against me and said my boss would not need to come back to Lamar Advertising ever again to work. This allegation made against me about “hitting” this employee while at work was completely bogus. How can I prove this? I was never charged with a crime by the police for assault and battery. The staffing agency never pursued charges against me. Lamar Advertising never pursued charges against me. The person that made the allegation never pursued charges against me. If I had physically hit another employee while on the job, I believe I would have gotten in much more trouble that being fired from Lamar Advertising. To make matters worse, the staffing agency fired me 4 days after this all took place. I was then unemployed for a full month before getting another job. So, if you decide to work as contract labor for Lamar Advertising, they will dispose of you like you are a piece of garbage and not lose a bit of sleep over it.

A series of disappointments from a company lacking clear direction and placing no value on employee morale.,2.0,"Sep 21, 2011","Once this was a place that valued employees and tried to ""share the wealth."" Still provides fairly stable employment for those that can tolerate the various quirks of management.","When the going gets tough, the truth comes out. Executives ""care"" about the rank and file employees only when the money is flowing. Then it's every man for himself. Truthfully, they are contemptuous of people not born with the silver spoon. Employees are not treated respectfully. There is no upward communication. It is not wanted and there is no opportunity for it. Execs spend all their time in their new luxury offices, or their various vacation homes, trying to figure out how to get the stock price back up so they can buy more toys. Employee perks like Christmas parties or birthday cakes are forbidden, while upper management still drives luxury cars on the company dime. And flies on a Lear Jet to their vacations.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm
Cutting edge company treats their employee's well very low turnover rate,5.0,"Jul 15, 2012",Committed to helping you do well in your position. Treats employee's well good work life balance overall. Very family oriented company.,"Not that much room for growth, people tend to stay in their positions for a lonnnnnngggg time. Due to a low turn over rate, it is hard to have your bosses position since he never leaves. However, they do train you to take his seat eventually if you choose to stay that long.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm
Good and Bad 'Graphic Design' Job,2.0,"Mar 29, 2010","Working at Lamar offered: 1. National recognition - it looked good on a resume. 2. Career Advancement - growth as a worker and valuable on-the-job experience. Also, designing billboards provided a unique talent which not many designers possess. 3. Networking Benefits - the company is huge and you can make a lot of contacts. 4. Independence - After training, managers rarely designed over your shoulder and allowed workers to freely use their own ideas and talents when creating billboard designs.","Working at Lamar lacked: 1. Leadership - manager did not have 4-year degree or managerial training in the Graphic Design field. In particular, my direct manager was a bit immature. 2. Worker Morale - many workers were negative, dissatisfied with management, or egotistical. 3. Worker Motivation - benefits and advanced positions were unfairly appropriated. Among lower workers, there seemed to be a distrust for management. Rewards for a job well done were often not much more than an ""atta-boy"" e-mail shot around to everyone in the office. 4. Teamwork - Competition among designers often inhibited designers' ability to rely on one another for thoughtful critique of their work. 5. The Work Itself - This is *not* work in a graphic design studio, it is an *advertisement design* job in which designers make billboards per the Sales Rep's direct instructions. Other projects were hard to come by (i.e.: logo design, poster or flyer design, etc.) and often given to managers.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm
Great place if you like low pay.,2.0,"Jan 20, 2010","Co-workers, whether in your location, other plants, or HQ tend to be friendly, helpful, and willing to teach you the ins-and-outs of the business and your job. Hours tend to be short, a strict 40 hour week. Everyone bolts for the door at 5pm and the boss (GM) locks the door at 5:15. No need to take work home with you, leave your cell phone on, etc. Your responsibility ends when you leave the office. The majority of the VP/GM's are pretty reasonable to work for. There is some flexibility if you need to alter your schedule for personal business, all they care is that you get your 40 hours in. There are dozens of plants to work at across the country, and you have the opportunity to apply for other locations if you choose. Most of the offices are pretty small and there is very little of the corporate politics you usually find at large companies.","Lamar seems to always be having financial problems, leading to constant penny-pinching in all areas. Don't think you're going to get decent bonuses, nice holiday parties, good raises, etc. unless you're in management. One year our holiday bonuses were $20 gas cards. Pay for many positiions is well below the market rate. Benefits are ""acceptable."" Unless you're a VP/GM you're not going to earn anything substantial at Lamar. A few of the VP/GM's are extreme micromanagers, cheapskates, etc. but you'll learn who they are quickly. Most of the IT systems/programs are horribly outdated. The monthly car allowance is low and was set in the era of $1.50/gal gas. If you're an account exec, real estate mgr, etc. covering a lot of turf, it comes nowhere near the cost of operating your car unless you drive an old clunker. There is little to no opportunity for advancement, unless you're a account exec who plans on staying for 20 years, at which time you may be considered for a VP/GM positiion. If you're not working in HQ, senior management is non-visible and out of the picture - might be a good thing though.",Lamar Advertising Company,LAMR,Specialty,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Lamar-Advertising-Reviews-E5998.htm
