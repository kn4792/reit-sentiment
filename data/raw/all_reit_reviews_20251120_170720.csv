An Amazing Place to Work — Where Integrity Comes First,5.0,"May 8, 2025","American Healthcare REIT is truly an amazing place to work. The C-suite leadership team is approachable, genuinely interested in each employee, and consistently makes decisions rooted in integrity. They emphasize doing the right thing and ensuring our operating partners have the tools they need to prioritize resident care. A standout example is the EVP of Asset Management—my direct leader—who embodies these principles and has done so consistently throughout his 30+ year career. His leadership style reflects the company's broader culture: a balance of high expectations and accountability with kindness, support, and authenticity. I’ve been with the company for just over a year, and I can confidently say these values are not just aspirational—they are put into action every day. The positive culture at AHR is evident across every service line and flows directly from the top down. Leaders recognize individual employee strengths and make a concerted effort to set people up for success, both personally and professionally. It’s important to me to work for leaders who not only speak about principles and values but also stand firmly behind them. I can say with full conviction that American Healthcare REIT lives up to what it promises.","While no company is without its challenges, I have yet to encounter any significant shortcomings at AHR. The culture here is so strong and positive that it far outweighs any minor issues that may arise.","American Healthcare REIT, Inc.",AHR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Healthcare-REIT-Reviews-E7171082.htm

However, opportunities to collaborate with others are limited, and while there is a strong sense of inclusivity when discussing the company’s future, the lack of clear advancement paths and middle management improvements hinder the overall culture.","Unfortunately, I experienced second-class treatment under my manager. Despite my hard work, I was often sidelined with fewer opportunities for advancement and recognition compared to those in favor with management. The culture encouraged snitching, which, combined with favoritism, fostered a toxic work environment. Those who aligned with management were rewarded, leaving others feeling unsupported.

Organization of dysfunction and toxcicity,1.0,"Sep 13, 2024",Decent healthcare plan Employee Stock plan,"Working in this organization was a deeply disappointing experience, marred by a complete lack of rationality and logical thinking within the decision-making process. The workplace culture is characterized by an alarming tendency to ignore expertise and embrace reactionary decision-making, leaving employees feeling undervalued and unsupported. One of the most glaring issues is the blatant disregard for the valuable insights provided by department managers. Some senior leaders consistently sideline their expertise, opting instead to heed decisions made by a select group of individuals who lack any relevant experience in the areas they are making decisions. This approach not only undermines the expertise of dedicated professionals but also leads to misguided choices that harm the organization in the long run. Promotions and significant raises, crucial aspects of career growth, are only awarded in select departments, and are not necessarily based on merit or skills, but on the basis of cronyism and favoritism. This nepotistic approach not only demoralizes employees who work hard and demonstrate exceptional skills but also fosters a toxic work environment where office politics reign supreme. Genuine talent is systematically ignored, leaving employees feeling insignificant and undervalued. Another alarming aspect of the workplace environment is the tendency to make sweeping cuts without fully understanding the ramifications. Impulsive cost-cutting measures are implemented without a comprehensive analysis, leading to decreased employee morale, increased workload, and overall dissatisfaction. These decisions have a domino effect on productivity and employee well-being, ultimately affecting the organization's overall performance. In conclusion, this workplace is a prime example of an organization where rationality, logic, and fair decision-making are sacrificed at the altar of favoritism, cronyism, and short-sightedness. Many employees are left disheartened and demoralized, leading to a toxic work environment that stifles creativity, innovation, and genuine professional growth.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

"Karma - Enjoy NY, Tom.",1.0,"Sep 29, 2017",Unfortunately at this time the company has absolutely nothing going for it. On the outside it can look and feel glamorous but it's the complete opposite.,"Day one Tom DeRosa came into the company telling everyone how down to earth he was, that he was an employee advocate and so much more. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Tom has been anti-Toledo since day one. The University of Toledo was never good enough to hire graduates or interns from. All new employees should live in Ann Arbor because Toledo wasn't good enough for people of his caliber. As a proud graduate of the University of Toledo that was all so disappointing. Tom has finally gotten his way. He looks like the hero donating the building and property to the University of Toledo but in reality it was only done to get his way and that is out of Toledo. Management continued to lie to employees that the building they were constructing in NY was not meant for a new headquarters. While it may not be the headquarters now, Tom will be working out of that office. Mark my word, eventually the headquarters will be in NY and the hardworking employees that have held it out during the chaotic and stressful times will no longer have a job. To the current employees, don't be afraid to move on. While people say the grass isn't always greener on the other side, I can promise you that this time it will be.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
Epic Fail,1.0,"Sep 27, 2017",It pays the bills. The corporate HQ was nice when Welltower owned it. The temperature in the building isn't too bad.,"This organization went from stellar to rock bottom in 12 months. Without ever addressing its new ""course of action"" with its employees, Welltower did a complete 180 and terminated about 30% of its workforce. It became a completely strange and confusing environment. Sadly, many important tasks aren't being completed due to the lack of staff. Current management is so focused on cutting compensation that they're not addressing the real struggles within the organization. Recently, Welltower donated its 100 acre Dorr Street (Toledo) campus to The University of Toledo. Nice save. The perfect opportunity to contradict all of the negative reviews that claim that the CEO doesn't live in Toledo nor does he care about the community. That job is done. This left the Toledo (Corporate HQ) based employees wondering what this means for their future in the company. Why would a real estate company give away a $30M piece of real estate if they plan to grow their HQ in Toledo? They don't. It's a slow kill, and it seems like this company is phasing its way out of the Toledo community. This will leave so many good, hard-working employees devastated. As for Welltower's claims that they are in the utmost compliance with regard to employee ethics, managers were instructed to grant nothing higher than a 3 rating on their reports' annual performance reviews. That means that Welltower has no intention of paying their employees based on performance. It's just a lure. What is ironic, is that Welltower only has a 2.6 rating on Glass Door.

Poison in the Well,1.0,"Apr 13, 2017",The cafe is pretty nice...,"I was initially positive about the prospect of change under the new executive management, headed by DeRosa and Mitra. Unfortunately, they have ham-fisted change management, and have squandered an opportunity to elevate the company to a more sustainable and long-term path to growth. Indiscriminately firing employees and falsely labeling the terminations as “for performance,” they have focused simply on head counts and cost-cutting for what can only be viewed as a setup for the company to be a take-over target by private equity, or some other buy-out of the current shareholders. Employees are scared and cringing, when they should have been empowered and impassioned. DeRosa has failed to impress with his leadership, and one can only surmise that the clock is ticking on the remaining 2 ½ years of his current contract to complete the deal. The duo of DeRosa and Mitra is about the most unlikely pairing one can imagine, and it’s likely they were dropped into place by much larger external players to grease the skids. Make no mistake, the employees are being fed a false bill of goods when they are told that the remaining “lucky” ones are in for some wonderful financial reward.

I assume it is cheaper to have people quit than fire them. They even have stopped cutting the grass at their once beautiful campus to supposedly cut cost. Meanwhile the executives fly on their private plane and the CEO is paid outlandishly (in my opinion). Other fun tidbits: Welltower has a market capitalization of approximately $25 billion as of September 10, 2018. Per salary.com: “As Chief Executive Officer at WELLTOWER INC, Thomas J. DeRosa made $10,518,064 in total compensation. Of this total $985,801 was received as a salary, $2,197,563 was received as a bonus, $0 was received in stock options, $7,250,000 was awarded as stock and $84,700 came from other types of compensation.

Their office in Florida is very stylish which includes a gym. They also offer gym reimbursement.","As mentioned in other reviews, atmosphere is very cliquey. It's all in who you know not what you know. If you have the luck of getting in the right people's good graces you will do good in this company. There are a handful of great people working there, but if you're not part of a clique you will feel isolated. Many occasions of being excluded from work or social gatherings. Some management leaders live in different states from their employees and are either too busy or just do not care. Weeks and months would go by without one word from the boss.

As time passed, the job became more difficult due to overwhelming staff cuts, workloads increased, morale was down, job loss was imminent. Employee concerns were brushed to the side by Sr. mgmt. with only one goal in mind - the end game for shareholders.

A league of its own,5.0,"Mar 5, 2019","Pros and cons are a matter of perspective. Through past experiences, I had come to expect very little from my employers. You came to work, did a job, and went home--it was transactional. That was the norm. To expect anything more was unrealistic. There were occasional employee appreciation events, but they felt more like gimmicks than gratitude. The culture reflected that mindset, and as a result, I felt very little connection to former employers. In comparison, Welltower is in a league of its own. I view my job as an extension of myself and genuinely look forward to coming to work every day. Describing the environment is difficult. It is competitive yet collaborative. It is a place where you can make an impression, regardless of your title. It is supportive and conducive to learning and professional/personal growth. Above all else, it is a place that is amazing because of the people you suit up and work with every day. Welltower has forever changed my perception of what the ""work experience"" can be. I'm proud and grateful for the opportunity to work here, and encourage anyone interested in the healthcare, real estate, or finance industries to check it out. Or, if you are like I was, and are just looking for more meaningful work.","Welltower is one of the flattest organizations I have ever worked for. In one hand, the culture provides opportunities that more siloed and compartmentalized companies could never match--things like challenging work, cross-functional projects, and development opportunities. On the other hand, it's an environment that can be stressful and overwhelming if you let yourself get consumed by the over-abundance of work.

They will quickly throw you under the bus to save their own tail and some individuals in management were not equipped to take on the role of manager. HR did not seem to be of any assistance so employees must either sink or swim. Ever since Tom took on the CEO position this company began to plummet--employee morale went down along with so many other things.

Don’t Leave Your Job to Come Here!!,2.0,"Sep 21, 2018","The benefits are good, most people are friendly (the ones that talk to you), always something to do so the work week goes by rather fast.","The feeling of job security is nonexistent for most people I talk with, everyone feels overwhelmed, overworked and under appreciated. Many employees are actively seeking other employment due to all of the above. The company that was once a place of pride has quickly lost its appeal.

Culture shift needed,2.0,"Jun 23, 2017","During my tenure at Welltower the benefits offered were amazing. Compared to the majority of companies who were forced to increase health insurance premiums while reducing coverage, Welltower offered their employees multiple choices for insurance coverage at an affordable out of pocket expense. Teams drastically differ and if you are lucky enough to align with a team whose members aren’t power hungry (few and far between) and want to foster a sense of team you can certainly gain a lot of knowledge.","This is a truly toxic work environment and the corporate culture leaves something to be desired. The corporate office is cut throat and I could count on one hand the amount of genuine people I ran into when working there. New employees should not expect to feel welcomed. You will have to go out of your way to become part of your team only have people treat you as though you don’t even belong in the same room as them. As stated in a previous comment it is true that you will go days without anyone stopping by your desk. While there are good people at Welltower the entitlement exuded from some people in this office make those ""good"" people stick to themselves. If you do not align yourself with the right people from day one this place will be very isolating. Don’t mention any issues about this to HR, they will twist everything to being your fault and will not advocate for you at all. As the saying goes “No good deed goes unpunished” do not offer to go above and beyond or make a simple offer to assist because it will be taken the wrong way. An innocent offer to help will be viewed as as a threat and/or seen as an attempt to make someone look bad. Even your own self-deprecating comments meant to make someone feel good about themselves is taken the wrong way. Unfortunately people you will work with here are so insecure about their own position and what will happen to their jobs you are best to keep your head down until you can find a way out. Skills are undervalued and underutilized regardless of your position, who you know and where you got your degree from means more than your work history. If you show interest in a different department or to learn more in an area do not expect anyone to want to give you any work or mentor you even if this benefits the company. It was very clear to me that people some who work here even those who had a long tenure with company were insecure about their positions and this fear for your job mentality infiltrated down from the highest paid employee to the lowest paid employee.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Phenomenal Experience,5.0,"Sep 22, 2022","I’ve found my work experience at Welltower thus far to be phenomenal in terms of professionalism, collaboration, and trust. I have felt such a strong satisfaction in my role and responsibilities. I’m not going to dis-credit the previous posts because I wasn’t in the same position or time and place as those that left them, but I do feel that the company is a *much* different company than it was half a decade ago in my assessment. Several previous complaints I see regarding compensation and benefits have been corrected. Welltower is a professional environment where I have been encouraged to express ideas to improve workflow and to achieve goals. My daily duties are versatile and stimulate my desire to do a great job and not only perform well in my own role, but to create a healthy workplace where others can do so as well. HR does a great job with onboarding and getting new employees familiar with not only the structure of the company. They offer free, wide-ranging, venues of training, coursework, seminars and classes available to all employees. There are internal communication tools that make knowledge sharing extremely easy and they are utilized regularly. Sense of teamwork and togetherness seldom found in corporate entities. A key part of doing well is to being willing to learn, ask questions, and put in work to perform your job to the best of your abilities. My direct supervisor is the absolute best: incredibly supportive and responsive. I’ve learned a lot from them already and feel genuinely appreciated in my role. Anytime I’ve had a question I’ve felt comfortable reaching out and going to anyone for help and they would assist or direct me to the right person. There’s a great opportunity for cross functional collaboration. I love that there’s an atmosphere of excellence over perfection and there seems to be an approach of constructive conflict resolution. I’ve previously worked in very cliquey atmosphere’s and Welltower is a complete opposite experience. I’ve seen several people from various backgrounds, degree levels, etc be in roles. Experience matters as well as who is best for the job, will perform the job well, and be a great fit. Because the structure at Welltower is pretty flat it allows for more cross-collaboration on projects, and development opportunities. You get to work across states with co-workers and managers in different locations – which allows for a lot of diversity of thought. I love working with others based out of Toledo, NY, FL, etc – and my co-workers have been collaborative and responsive. Benefits: Current postings are 100% accurate on benefits. • Competitive Base Salary + Annual Bonus • VERY Generous Paid Time Off and Holidays • Employer-matching 401(k) Program + Profit Sharing Program • Student Debt Program – monthly contribution to my student loans each month (up to $10,000 over life of the loan). • Tuition Assistance Program • Employee Stock Purchase Program – purchase shares at a 15% discount • Comprehensive and progressive Medical/Dental/Vision options • Package I selected is the BEST coverage I’ve ever had w/ low monthly premiums • Summer Hours Program • Flexible schedule w/options to work from home – excellent work/life balance • In office gym + gym/wellness reimbursements • Modern and contemporary beautiful office! • Great culture with friendly, open people & regular fun, interactive office events! • Snack + drink options to keep you fueled and productive throughout the day.","Because the company is in the midst of rapid growth there are some natural challenges that come with that and can be difficult for some if you’re not accustomed to change, being flexible, and adjusting to changes in leadership and will have to be comfortable working across states with your co-workers and managers being in a different location. I think for most that our time in Covid has made us all able to adjust and handle this – and we’ve all become semi-experts on video meeting protocols! Also due to their being various offices and regions there could be a bit more consistency on how things are done in each region. There could be some increases in communication when changes come. This is always going to be challenging when you have a company this size, but I know it’s something looking to be improved. Obviously as a publicly traded company there is a financial obligation to increase earnings growth and serving shareholders, however in my opinion this isn’t done at the expense of the employees at all.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Indeed Very Scary Times ....,1.0,"Jul 2, 2017",The gym and the office itself.,"Honestly, just too many to list. First and foremost, it's pretty sad that the company's propaganda machine is putting in their own reviews to slow down this avalanche of negative feedback on Glassdoor. It's pretty obvious HR is entering in these reviews. You knew what you were going to get and what was going to happen when you brought select people on board in 2016 that have a reputation for causing friction and angst among others. One of the senior leaders currently there has single-handedly destroyed what was once a great company culture and environment, and instead created one of extreme fear, politics, and backstabbing. As the saying goes, you reap what you sow. Deal with the fall out and consequences of your actions. In addition, to show you how vested these so called leaders are in the company and Toledo area itself, the CEO, along with many others, don't even live in Toledo. CEOs of all the major corporations in Toledo, live in Toledo, except for this company. New recruiters and new hires are being told to live in Ann Arbor instead of Toledo in order to get them to join the company. That's a complete shame and disservice to the city of Toledo. As many reviewers have correctly pointed out, there are cliques inside this company.

Confidence beats Competence,1.0,"Mar 12, 2017",Be prepared to have this company be your abusive boyfriend and keep you coming back for more because it's tough to find another place that's going to pay you what this place will in Toledo.,"The CEO and upper management are completely out of touch with the rest of the company. The CEO is a diva that cuts employee compensation to pay dividends to shareholders all the while traveling via private jet on an endless rock star tour and making no sacrifices of his own for the sake of the company. The morale in the office is one of so much fear of losing your job, trying to stay off the radar, and anxiety about when the other shoe is going to drop. No one is safe unless you know the right butt to kiss and even then you're still at risk of ending up on the CEO's henchman's infamous list of people on the chopping block. Politics aside, no one in upper management wants to take accountability and therefore the place is in a constant state of decision-making paralysis. This used to be a decent place to work with amazing employee perks but under the new regime it's just an abusive relationship and a paycheck. Oh and while they make budget cuts to employee compensation they send long-time, competent employees packing under the guise of ""poor performance"". Expect to see this place fail big time in the near future if they can't turn things around for employees.

Toledo ship sunk by Iceberg CEO,1.0,"Sep 8, 2018","For the employees that are still around to their paychecks, there is plenty of work to do. Due to the vehemently denied and therefore unofficial shift of HQ from Toledo to NY the office is less bourgeois and obnoxious.","Very few of the employees that are left have the experience or knowledge to do what needs to be done to maintain a successful company. The CEO, having completed the turnover of the executive team and majority of upper management has surrounded himself with Yes Men. He has successfully annihilated any value and experience that existed on that team as well. Meanwhile, the core staff are being worked to the bone and are provided with zero guidance from leadership. No one is willing to take responsibility and lead. It's all about who can boast the loudest and make themselves look good whilst standing on the necks of the downtrodden remnants of what was once a talented workforce. Throwing money at vendors and consultants is the name of the game right now, in a poor attempt to fill in the gaps from the loss of quality employees due to lay offs and a toxic culture. No one in a position to fix the culture is willing to admit that there is even a problem, as that would force them to take a look in the mirror and admit that they aren't doing their job. Human Capital would rather spend time trying to get all of the excruciatingly honest Glassdoor reviews removed instead of actually doing something about the repeated complaints about culture and lack of leadership. Human Capital, the most overstaffed department at this lameduck company, is too busy patting themselves on the back, promoting themselves and feeding leadership and the board of directors poorly constructed stories that everything is just great, to even realize what is going on with the actual ""human capital"" inside the walls of the Toledo office.

"No leadership, hostile work environment, worst corporate culture ever",1.0,"May 8, 2019",Welltower is a good example of what a company should not be. It is everything that Peter Drucker warned business leaders against in his books on management and leadership.,"While there are too many mention, I will give the top three. 1. Leadership. General managers do nothing to resolve issues between the property management division and the project management division. Vice presidents do nothing to hold general managers accountable. Vice presidents and general managers refuse to talk to their employees. When people in key leadership positions leave the company, it is the responsibility of senior management to fill the voids with temps or to fill in those voids themselves. Instead, management waits indefinitely for a key position to be filled while the organization turns into a hostile work environment. Management does nothing to make sure that employees are properly trained before assuming their positions. Human resources does nothing to verify that managers have trained new employees. 2. Accountability. General contractors do as they please because there is no oversight by the project managers. Contractors leave the tenants irate and the buildings in worse condition, but are rewarded with more contracts. Welltower project mangers do not bother to read the contracts before signing and miss the fine print where the general contractor has stated that there is no warranty for the work being performed. When the contractor has finished with a project, he is given his last check and no punch walk or final punch walk is performed. It is clear that amateurs are at work. 3. No communication. Management deliberately withholds information from its employees. Because of management’s incompetence, it does not want any information to be divulged outside of its circle because the details are very embarrassing.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Poison in the Well (Part 2),1.0,"Apr 26, 2017","Modern and contemporary office. Some decent perks, like discounts off monthly gym memberships, although many of these perks are slowly being whittled away due to cost reduction initiatives being implemented.","A lot of information-holding and lack of knowledge sharing from others within the company, due to competitive nature of some employees and their desire to maintain an edge over others. Lack of collaboration in work culture and environment. It's not uncommon for a whole day to go by and not have anyone stop by your desk to ask a question or discuss something. You'll be inundated with countless emails or instant messages instead. Very old-school culture where flexibility is not viewed favorably. Also, hard work does not pay off, if you're not part of the right group that is laughing daily in the hallway and joking around. It's a very cliquey culture that reminds one of high school. Favouritism is clearly obvious by some people, especially by the newer employees. If you're not part of the crowd that lives in the bustling, cosmopolitan metropolis of Ann Arbor and commute to work in Toledo, you're at a disadvantage already in your career in the view of some. A lot of politics, especially with the new employees that have been there only a year or two. If an error is made, be prepared for a special task force to be assigned to figure out what happened and who should be roasted for it in front of everyone else. You don't know what's being said behind your back at any given point in time. Some of the new employees used to work on Wall Street, so be prepared to deal with those types of personalities, which can be unprofessional and very aggressive.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Good collective health care and pension scheme. There are some nice people with whom you can get along (and bond over your complaints).,"No communication between departments, no cooperation or team spirit. No proactivity, non-efficient procedures. Ineffective IT technology, slow computers and system with legacy issues, old school culture. No flexibility to work from home/shift lunch hours. Travel costs are only partially covered (others with older contracts have no travel reimbursement at all), parking fee is not covered (all Dutch companies fully cover all these). Favouritism in the office and by HR. Efforts aren't appreciated, management doesn't want associates to develop their knowledge, so that they won't become stronger on the job market, hence less likely to leave. Still incredibly high turnover as employees are unhappy and do regular unpaid overtime. If you voice your concern or unsatisfaction, let alone criticise management or say that you want to move to a higher role, they will drive you to leave the company. HR does everything they can so that they don't have to offer an indefinite contract. Promotion on tenure, not on performance.",W. P.

"High Bar, High Reward",5.0,"Sep 23, 2025","I’ve been at Ventas for just over two years now, and I’ve seen this company shift from good to truly great. When I first joined, there was energy and ambition — lots of “we can do more” — but more recently I feel like we’ve found our stride. The leadership isn’t just chasing growth; they’re being very intentional about how we grow, where we invest, and making sure we build sustainable advantage. For a large S&P 500 company, the corporate team is surprisingly small and nimble. You actually see the outcome of your work and feel connected to what’s happening at the top. There’s not a lot of red tape — people focus on the work and on doing it well. The pace can be quick and priorities can shift, but that comes with being in a company that’s looking ahead instead of playing catch-up — and that’s a good place to be.","It’s a small, high-performing team with nowhere to hide.

Not Recommended,2.0,"Sep 11, 2023",Pay is good for position and great benefits,"Complete and total lack of work life balance. As well as absolutely no opportunities for growth and development. If you decide to work for them then make sure you are happy with the job title and the salary offered. While they do provide small annual salary increases it doesn’t do enough to compensate for lack of career growth. There are some nice managers here, but overall leadership is clueless when it comes to helping their employees grow and develop in the company. Considering that this is a vital part of leadership I would consider the leadership at the company extremely poor. They don’t have the first clue when it comes to true leadership. It doesn’t matter how hard or long you work for them there is absolutely zero effort by them to help you succeed. When a job comes open they’ll fill from someone outside the company. They don’t even bother looking at internal candidates. Companies with good leadership helps their employees to grow and develop within the organization. Don’t be fooled by the salary! It’s a trap. Go to a company with clear strategies for growth and development.

Micromanagement and Bad Work-Life Imbalance,1.0,"Oct 21, 2023",Competitive pay compared to other companies,"Working at Ventas feels like an endless 24/7 commitment, with little consideration for personal time or boundaries. Since my start, I've found myself working on most weekends, nights, vacations, and even during flights for work-related tasks. The oppressive culture of micromanagement is deeply rooted within my team. My managers exhibit an incessant need to oversee every minor task, going as far as reviewing my emails before I can even send them out. This level of oversight leaves little room for independent decision-making and stifles any potential for professional growth. For those considering a position at this company, it's essential to be aware of the high turnover rate. A cursory LinkedIn search is likely to reveal a string of predecessors in the role you're eyeing. I would strongly advise reaching out to them and asking questions to gain a better understanding of what you may be getting into.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

Every minor decision needs to be touched/seen by executive team - no autonomy/trust even on senior level employees. Below average pay with false promises of promotions/advancement. Lack of leadership commitment to develop entry to mid-level employees and no focus on retention & keeping good talent. Retention efforts led to money being thrown at some employees (highly discriminatory on who received awards) Lack of accountability for poor people management - exodus of employees yet no real change at the top based off employee feedback. Culture is non-existent; fire drill mentality for non-issue items. Peppered with non-purposeful engagement events - employees are in silos in their respective departments even though its a relatively small company.

The executives love to tout the company’s long term performance but the real outperformance occurred years ago - just look at a stock chart. The dirty secret is that the leadership hasn’t done anything valuing enhancing in years. The CEO is a masterful deal maker, but has surrounded herself with sycophants and yes men and gets involved in every minor decision. The executives slap each other on the backs and hoard oversized pay, while the next layers of employees do all the real work and provide the creative ideas, with little credit. Serious talent has walked out the door, new hires rarely stick, and those tenured employees that have stayed have become too damaged from years of mind games to know any better. The HR function is out of step and focuses mostly on spinning employee engagement results to look positive.","Ventas, Inc.",VTR,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ventas-Inc-Reviews-E8222.htm

Honestly a great place to work,5.0,"Feb 14, 2023","I've been at ventas for more than 4 years and honestly have to say that I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews. However, I do know that the pros/cons definitely are shaped by thier department and reporting managers. I personally want to congratulate Ventas on the job they did during the pandemic. Management was on the forefront and well ahead of the curve and although we lost 25-30% of the company in May of 2020, they were extremely transparent on the cuts and why and I couldn't be more proud of how they have adapted ""post-pandemic"". In the professional world there will always be deadlines, lots of work on the plate, however I've found that working closely with your manager to prioritize and set expectations on delivery solves 99% of the issues. They are always providing training opportunities, open to hearing new ideas and always looking for ways in increase efficiency. They heavily invest in their employees and after 20 years in the professional work force, Ventas is top notch.","There appears to be vast differences in managment styles between departments which really can impact how an employee feels.

"Great pay, but poor communication within the organization",1.0,"Feb 19, 2025",They offered great pay and it was an experience to know what I need to focus on in my career. It was very difficult to maintain the hours they promised me as a FTE due to the lack of work. They were also very quick to hire me once they learned I wanted to be a FTE and was looking for those types of hours.,"They had very poor communication within the team. I felt like I was constantly sending emails to HR to find out what my options were to try to resolve the lack of communication. Since I was a HCC coder who was at the end of the cycle they had very poor communication about end of contracts with clients so there was a lot of shifting us around since there was a loss of work with various clients with very poor management. I was hired on to just to be moved around with little to no explanation of the expectation of the contract and then let go after a few months thinking I had job security again with little communication. I had to provide my own equipment (computer, extra monitor & encoder) at my own expense. The training for the contract was nonexistent and when asked I about it I was told that everyone there should already know how to code so it was not necessary. You will quite literally be thrown into the position.","Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.",OHI,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Omega-Healthcare-Reviews-E326877.htm
Not a serious organization,2.0,"Jan 4, 2025","Omega shuffles their employees around a lot. Which is one of the things I don't appreciate about them, but at least they're good at it. If one contract runs out of work they're good about shifting you over to a new one pretty quick.","A lot to say here. My experience at Omega was limited, and for good reason. The career opportunities could be pretty good, if you can get past multiple audits. The auditing system seemed really inconsistent to me. Things that would be unmentioned in one audit could sink you in the same account type on the next audit, and I never got an explanation as to why this seemed so erratic. When the standard for accuracy is so high, I should at least be able to get an answer on why something is graded a certain way so that I can learn for next time. But none of the auditors or managers seemed to want to actually talk about the audits. One of my audits got covid guidelines concerning Z11.52 and Z20.822 flat out wrong, which I knew for a fact and still no one wanted to listen, to them it was just another score to rush through. I had to practically beg them to stop for a moment and listen to me so that we could talk, and eventually the score was reversed. Managers were probably the worst part of the experience, they're more interested in playing mind games than helping their employees succeed. The culture is very poor. I actually lost a contract here because a manager felt that it would be a better use of her time to investigate my daily actions for two weeks than to just tell me that I was doing poorly, and of course by the time she decided to tell me, the corrective action that I took didn't matter because my contract could not be salvaged. I was essentially railroaded and hung out to dry by an immature manager who wasn't willing to meet the demands for professionalism she made of her staff. However, to Omega's credit, once I told them what had happened they did find me a new contract fairly quickly. If you sign on here, always ask questions, be annoying if you have to, because it's entirely on your head if you don't know something. If a lower level manager assigns you something special make sure it's cleared with one of the upper level managers because the manager to manager communication is questionable. Moving on, there were other relatively smaller things. In the two and a half years I worked at Omega, I never once managed to get in contact with the HR department, and I tried by Outlook, Teams, and phone. I can't even verify they have an HR department because I never once talked to them. There is no live coding education or support system in place. All coding questions need to be routed to your manager, and who knows if they'll have the time or interest that day. IT can be pretty hard to work with. I had an issue where Outlook emails from my contractor were not always reaching me, which is obviously a pretty serious issue, and that was just something I had to work around because IT never provided a fix. I was expected to have Outlook and Teams on my phone so that I could reply even when I was off the clock or on lunch break. It was nearly impossible to stay at one contract for long just because the contractors kept bringing on too many people, and I would have appreciated more stability. Omega does not even provide all the equipment you need, you're expected to furnish some of that on your own. I had to buy a computer and two monitors for my very first contract with Omega. With later contracts a laptop was actually furnished for me and I'm not sure what the difference was. It may be non-Optum versus Optum contracts. But this was extremely expensive, and the Omega recruiter who first contacted me told me he could provide me a bonus to help offset the cost. What he did not tell me was that the bonus was performance based, which of course wasn't possible after I lost that one contract. This was obviously not a great experience and my mental health suffered greatly, I would not apply here again unless I had zero other options.","Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.",OHI,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Omega-Healthcare-Reviews-E326877.htm

Things that were considered educational findings on audits in my past (findings not affecting DRG, unrelated Z codes) were counted as points deducted repeatedly. Lots and lots of incorrect audit findings (not paid for excess time reviewing the audit) sometimes would agree and other times auditors do not budge even when supported by research and other auditors agreeing with coder. Management may also agree with coder but the findings/audit score will not change. Management seemed as frustrated with auditing as coders.

What a nightmare this company is!,1.0,"Jan 13, 2024",I can't think of one good thing.,"Recruiter just strings you along forever, telling you to not go outside of him to look for other work and to not worry, that there is plenty of work to be had. Typical salesman. Tell them anything they want to hear, as long as you get their business. Onboarding process was a nightmare and if you want help from your supervisor, you're screwed. Three weeks after being hired, I was let go and told I was done with Omega because I couldn't get my coding productivity up to 95%. When in reality, it was my questions about their timecard process and onboarding process was just too much to deal with when they mass hired at the time I was brought on. This was news to me as it wasn't what my recruiter said, but my coding supervisor said I was brought on as ""seasonal"". When you show them where their coding process is missing information, they never apologize. In fact, it's somehow your fault. They are very good at making your feel like a small fish in a big sea, and my coding manager was definitely on a huge power trip and seemed to enjoy emailing me with a verbal warning on day seven of my employment. It's pretty obvious that they do try to weed you out during the onboarding process. I now realize that I 'd rather not work with a company that treats their new employees so horribly.

Will say something one week, and the next week say they never said that even with multiple witnesses. No appreciation or care for their employees, benefits are not good and are too expensive. They also give short notice of mass layoffs. They will use you until they have no use for you anymore. It's a production based job and all they care about are numbers.

I didn't do that for 2 weeks; I was not informed to do so. And if management told me they weren't going to pay me for those times, I would have simply made it up during that week. Management told they randomly select employees and run a report showing what was worked, how long & if their are blank spots of production. Those ""blank spots"" are totalled up & you must subtract that from your timesheet. They of course tell you this the following week. If you do not subtract the time they are demanding, then your pay for that entire week is held hostage. You have to lie about the hours you put in for omega.

En general las personas son amables y los procesos de contratación son rapidos.,"La situación en la empresa está llegando a un punto insostenible. Lo más grave es que, a pesar de la cantidad de personas que se siguen contratando, las condiciones laborales no mejoran, sino que empeoran. El espacio para almorzar es insufrible, con mesas apretadas como si estuviéramos en un comedor comunitario. Los casilleros ni siquiera dan abasto, pero parece que seguirán contratando gente sin pensar en cómo organizar este caos. Estos problemas, aunque molestos, son menores en comparación con lo que realmente está dañando el ambiente: la falta de transparencia y el favoritismo descarado en los procesos de selección y promoción. Las convocatorias para cargos como QA, supervisores y demás son una farsa. La realidad es que ya tienen a alguien “de antemano” para esos puestos. Las promociones no se dan por méritos, sino por conexiones personales. El que sube es el que es amigo del jefe, el que le cae bien, el que tiene algún vínculo cercano, o incluso el que adula para conseguir favores.

My review,3.0,"Jan 17, 2025",Training is excellent and relevant.,Stagnation due to age-bound promotion policy which requires employees to complete 2 years for being eligible for promotion at every level. Very slow and stagnated growth due to this. No support for employee knowledge enhancement as there is no sponsored certification program. Support functions like Admin and Information Technology are mostly arrogant. Some of the Admin managers and executives are behaving very rudely. IT engineers are making their own rules for providing support while these rules or policies are not being mentioned anywhere. IT infrastructure is also very primitive. Compliance Team tends to block even the most genuine and most necessary websites. There is no support from the Back to Office (B2O) team in the Night shifts while every request their approvals are required. The overall response of these teams is pathetic and it causes inordinate delays. The HR policies are not employee friendly. The employees are not given reasonable time to apply for their leaves or absences after the payroll period is completed.,"Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.",OHI,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Omega-Healthcare-Reviews-E326877.htm

"Competitive salary, but certainly no work-life balance.",2.0,"Feb 28, 2024",- Competitive salary compared to other companies. - Training is detailed. - Incentives for being top performer.,"- Unrealistic quotas. Need to complete at least 18 prior authorization requests per shift, but there's also a call hold rule to wait for 3 hours for a single call made to payer. Each case has a minimum of 4 calls to process not to mention the call drops/disconnects wherein you need to redial. - Different QAs, different standards. You pass or fail depending on how the QA analyzes the case - no matter how much effort you put into working a single case. - A lot of agents tend to go after quantity instead of quality. You'll even see updates on notes indicating only a single ""."" and ""call disconnected"" multiple times even when no call was made, and yet supervisors still tolerate behaviors like these. - High turnover rate. - A lot of tenured peeps also chooses the case they want to process leaving newbies with the most complicated ones. - It appears like QA and Training Team work together against Prod. You will get confused who you should follow in processing the case. - No support system. You're on your own unless your team lead is generous enough to help you. - COE and backpay too a long time to be released (literally more than a year after separation from the company) despite completeness of documentation provided. They will not process it unless you follow it up daily.","Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.",OHI,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Omega-Healthcare-Reviews-E326877.htm
