Upper management wants control over every inch of the premier deals, and second guesses the employees work on a regular basis. They also assign tasks that consume loads of time that are not critical to completing the core objectives. The whole company lacks executable organization tools. NO REAL ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT EXISTS. Leasing support tasks and responsibilties of other departments regularly get pushed onto leasing, since the company attitude is that leasing's paycheck depends on completion of these support tasks. Multiple systems all requiring manual entry insures that a lot of errors occur in the system. There is no one single, reliable source for information.
