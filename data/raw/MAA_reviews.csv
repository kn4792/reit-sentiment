I’ve been fortunate to work in a region with truly wonderful team members, which has made my experience positive on the local level.","However, the corporate side can feel somewhat disconnected from the day-to-day operations at the property level. While they present themselves as supportive, their approach often feels more focused on revenue than on resident satisfaction. Policies are quite strict, and many properties face challenges with aging facilities due to limited budgets for repairs or upgrades.

100% TRUTHFUL REVIEW AFTER 8 YEARS!,5.0,"Jan 9, 2025","I have had the privilege of working for Mid America Apartments (MAA) for eight years and seven months, and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. Since joining the company in 2016, I have witnessed firsthand the remarkable growth and unwavering commitment to core values that define MAA. One of the standout aspects of working at MAA is the comprehensive support provided to employees. The company has established robust systems, programs, and training opportunities that empower individuals to succeed in their roles. This dedication to equipping employees with the necessary tools fosters a culture of achievement and professional development. I firmly believe that the strength of MAA begins at the top. The leadership, particularly the CEO, demonstrates a genuine appreciation for employees, creating an environment where everyone feels valued. Throughout my tenure, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with numerous talented individuals, including regional managers, RVPs, and property managers, all of whom contribute to the sense of community that MAA embodies. MAA actively listens to its employees, as evidenced by regular surveys that solicit feedback. It is impressive to see how management not only gathers input but also takes actionable steps to implement changes based on employee suggestions. This responsiveness reflects the company's commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability. Work-life balance has never been an issue for me at MAA. The generous allocation of holidays, personal days, and vacation time, along with wellness initiatives, exemplifies the company's dedication to employee well-being. In fact, I often found it challenging to utilize all the time afforded to me. As I reflect on my journey with MAA, I am immensely grateful for the opportunities I have had to grow in business and customer service. The leadership and support I received have significantly shaped my professional development. For anyone considering a career in the multifamily housing sector, I wholeheartedly recommend Mid America Apartments. You will not be disappointed by the culture, support, and opportunities for growth that MAA offers. Thank you, MAA, for an incredible experience and for shaping me into the professional man I am today.",Property transfer should be a lot simpler or raise the commission pay.,MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

Big Changes Needed,2.0,"Jun 9, 2023","The PTO time offered is generous, some of the people within the company genuinely care about change and the greater good.",Through my time with MAA values were always spoke about however as the company grew and became larger I felt more of a number rather than a human. I was told I should have cancelled PTO time already schedule 6+ months in advance because cold weather had come through and I should have been at the property. Then when on leave for a death in the family I was thanked for coming back early because I felt guilted although I was not anywhere near prepared to come back. Through struggles and tribulation you don't really have the support needed - rather put under a microscope and questioned. When leaving my position was posted prior to my RVP even having a conversation with me.

Not too good of a company,1.0,"Jun 19, 2024","Despite the numerous challenges faced while working at MAA, one significant positive aspect is the camaraderie among coworkers. The colleagues are generally supportive, friendly, and willing to collaborate, which creates a sense of community and makes the daily grind more manageable. Working with such a dedicated and approachable team has been a highlight, providing much-needed support and encouragement amidst the otherwise difficult work environment.","As a former employee, I feel compelled to share my experiences and shed light on the unethical practices that plague this company. Both employees and residents deserve to know the truth about the organization they are dealing with. While MAA may appear to be a reputable company from the outside, the reality is far from it. From the beginning, it became clear that MAA prioritizes cutting costs over providing adequate employee support and training. New hires are often thrown into their roles without proper guidance, leading to confusion and frustration. This lack of exercise not only hinders employees' ability to perform their duties effectively but also results in increased stress and burnout. The workload at MAA is overwhelming and unrealistic. Employees are expected to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, often without sufficient resources or workforce. This constant pressure to meet unattainable targets leads to long working hours and a deteriorating work-life balance. Management's refusal to address this issue highlights their disregard for employee well-being. Despite the demanding nature of the job, MAA fails to provide fair compensation to its employees. Salaries are often below industry standards, and there are limited opportunities for career advancement or salary increases. This lack of financial recognition further demoralizes employees and contributes to high turnover rates within the company. The culture at MAA is toxic and oppressive. Management fosters an environment of fear and intimidation, where employees are constantly micromanaged, and their contributions are undervalued. Constructive feedback is rarely given; instead, employees are subjected to harsh criticism and blame. This toxic atmosphere creates a hostile work environment, making it difficult for employees to thrive or feel motivated. One of the most glaring issues at MAA is the neglect of maintenance and repairs on their properties. Residents frequently face delayed or incomplete repairs, leading to prolonged inconvenience and discomfort. For instance, a resident at MAA Rocky Point in Tampa reported, ""Maintenance requests take forever to be addressed. I had to wait weeks for a simple plumbing issue to be fixed"" (BestProsInTown). Similarly, at MAA Coral Springs in Florida, a resident mentioned, ""Maintenance is slow and often does a poor job. It feels like they do the bare minimum to get by"" (RentCafe). This consistent neglect results in subpar living conditions for tenants, who feel their concerns are not taken seriously. MAA's customer service is severely lacking. Residents' concerns and complaints are often ignored or brushed aside, with little effort made to resolve issues promptly. The company prioritizes profit over quality service, leaving residents feeling unheard and unvalued. This lack of responsiveness and empathy creates a negative living experience for tenants. MAA has a notorious reputation for implementing unjust rent increases. Residents are subjected to frequent and substantial rent hikes without any corresponding improvement in the quality of service or living conditions. This exploitative practice places an undue financial burden on tenants, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet. MAA's focus on maximizing profit at the expense of residents' well-being is unethical and unfair. Transparency is sorely lacking in MAA's operations. Important information regarding lease agreements, maintenance schedules, and policy changes is often withheld or poorly communicated to residents. This lack of transparency creates confusion and frustration among tenants, further eroding their trust in the company. It is my sincere hope that someone exposes MAA for what it truly is—a company that disregards the needs and concerns of its employees and residents. Both employees and residents deserve better, and it is imperative that MAA is held accountable for its unethical practices. Until significant changes are made, I strongly advise against working for or residing in an MAA property. Another significant issue at MAA is the lack of compassion and genuine concern from the HR team. They often pretend to listen when employees bring up issues, but their responses are typically superficial and lack any real intent to address or resolve the problems. This disingenuous approach from HR leaves employees feeling unsupported and ignored, exacerbating the already challenging work environment. It's crucial for the HR department to genuinely engage with employees' concerns and take meaningful action to improve their experiences within the company.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

Very Questionable Practices,1.0,"Jun 11, 2024",N/A - I would not trust anything they say.,"As a former employee of MAA (Mid-America Apartment Communities), I feel it is crucial to shed light on the deeply rooted ethical and business practice issues within this organization. My experience with MAA has revealed significant concerns regarding their ethics, accounting practices, and overall business ethics. Ethical Violations: A Company Without a Moral Compass Disregard for Employee Welfare: MAA’s treatment of employees often falls short of basic ethical standards. The company consistently fails to provide a safe and supportive work environment, ignoring employee well-being in favor of cost-cutting measures. This disregard manifests in excessive workloads, inadequate training, and a pervasive culture of fear and blame. Misleading Communication: There is a consistent pattern of misleading communication both internally and externally. Employees are often kept in the dark about key decisions that affect their roles and responsibilities. Similarly, residents are frequently misinformed about leasing terms, rent increases, and maintenance schedules. Retaliatory Practices: Whistleblowers and employees who raise concerns about unethical practices face retaliation. This creates a culture of silence where wrongdoing is perpetuated rather than addressed. Employees fear for their job security, leading to an environment where unethical behavior goes unchecked. Accounting Practices: Lack of Transparency and Integrity Falsified Financial Reports: There have been numerous instances where financial reports appear to be manipulated to present a more favorable image of the company’s financial health. This lack of transparency not only misleads investors but also undermines trust in the company’s financial integrity. Improper Allocation of Funds: Funds meant for maintenance and improvements are often diverted for other purposes. This misallocation leads to deteriorating property conditions, which directly impacts the living standards of residents. The lack of proper financial oversight allows these practices to continue unchecked. Inflated Fees and Charges: MAA imposes inflated fees on residents and potential tenants, often without adequate justification. These fees include high application fees, unwarranted move-out charges, and unexplained rent increases. The financial burden placed on residents through these practices is both unethical and exploitative. Business Ethics: Profit Over Principles Exploitive Leasing Practices: The company employs aggressive and often deceptive leasing practices. Prospective tenants are enticed with false promises about property conditions and amenities, only to find a starkly different reality once they move in. This bait-and-switch tactic is not only unethical but also damages the company’s reputation. Neglect of Maintenance Obligations: MAA’s neglect of maintenance obligations is a clear breach of ethical standards. Maintenance requests are routinely ignored or inadequately addressed, leaving residents in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. This neglect is a direct result of prioritizing profit margins over resident welfare. Environmental Negligence: The company’s environmental practices are also questionable. There is a noticeable lack of effort to implement sustainable and environmentally friendly practices across their properties. This negligence reflects a broader disregard for corporate social responsibility. Tenant Harassment: In some cases, residents who express dissatisfaction or demand accountability are met with harassment and intimidation tactics. This includes threats of eviction, unwarranted fines, and other forms of pressure aimed at silencing criticism and maintaining control.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

I received 5 weeks of vacation plus sick & personal days off... not to mention Holidays and almost all weekends off so it made up for the long work weeks.

Questionable Direction,3.0,"Sep 15, 2022",Positive relationship with colleagues and vendors* Attempt to make positive changes (recently increased commission pay to $100/lease & renewal that used to be $80) Ability to make own decisions* *depends on factors,"MAA is slow to adapt to modern day salary. Leasing is still paid under $15/hr in MOST regions. APMs are paid no more, or around, $20/hr and PMs could vary from 55k-57k/year starting out. All seem very low compared to other major competitors (Camden, Windsor, Roscoe and Greystar). MAA is starting to consolidate and remove onsite positions (leasing, apm and pm) and combine multiple assets. In theory, this is nice. But reality, it a) removes promotional opportunities to beginner level managers, b) creates more onsite headaches and overworks onsite employees and c) clutters transition. Training in new roles are awful. What was once a one-on-one mentor to trainee environment for new hires is now bulked into a class of 10 or more. For manager training, it has now been converted to Webex/FaceTime chats rather than taking the time to send someone onsite to train in person to get to know your property better.

The expectations are incredibly high, which would be more tolerable if the pay wasn't so low. Upper management has no idea the sacrifices and time that their on-site teams are putting in to benefit the residents because overtime is just not allowed. I have experienced multiple employees working for hours ""off the clock"" because they refuse to let the job go undone or disappoint residents or move-ins but do not want to get in trouble for their hours. Your policy of ""shaving off"" overtime is a joke. If I'm taking time away from my personal life because something vital has to be done then why should I be punished by ""getting rid of my hours"".

Comes in the office all smiles and fake, walks in and becomes a bull dog about pricing and renewals and leases. The fake high pitched ""HI TEAM"" is really just an opening line she does on every property, like she is the one who gets the leases.

I worked weekends completely alone, and late hours (long after dark) with no one there by myself, in an unlocked leasing office lobby where anyone could in. It didn't help that my property was in an unsafe area, and crime was an everyday, common occurrence at the community. We even experienced a break-in of our model home, and after finding the intruder sleeping in one of the beds during a routine walk-through of the apartment, the company did nothing to ensure it would not happen again except make us check the windows and doors on a regular basis to ensure they were secure. We even had a mentally ill and disturbed resident storm into the leasing office, covered in blood and threatening to kill everyone there. Not only did local police do nothing to protect us, but the company's ""solution"" to the crisis was to assign online learning modules titled ""dealing with angry customers"". Gee, thanks. There were no home alarms, no cameras, no security, nothing. I felt unsafe everyday at my job, and it is the primary reason I left. Please, before considering a career with MAA, do diligent research on the community you will be assigned to, it's location and history with crime, and ask the company what they can do to offer protection and security to their employees.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

Unappreciative Company,2.0,"Jan 8, 2022",Stable job with great training and teaching resources. Good work life balance.,I can't say much positive with my experience. I was literally #1 on their star sales (leasing incentive list) in Houston in 2021 and I felt very unappreciated. I received no recognition from anyone in the company other than what I consider some good friends I made. The pay is very uncompetitive with the commission structure + base pay. This was my first job in property management but I am VERY familiar with the industry and pay standards as I have numerous family in manger/corporate positions in other companies. The company feels very unorganized with trying to incorporate so many changes to the leasing/on site processes that just don't work. When giving feedback they do nothing to fix the reported issues. I find that many of the employees (while not toxic) simply do not care. I worked at a few properties with MAA and each time it was either unorganized with little communication within the team and I shouldered much of the load. MAA is very okay with doing the bare minimum and following trends. They do not push the envelope. They even had me come in to work while I was tested positive with COVID! MAA only cares about their outward appearance and not their employees.,MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

But residents complaining, whether about the state of their apartment, their noisy neighbors, or how incompetent you are because you can't accept their payment for rent or whatever it might be really wears you down. Since they're the customer, all you are able to do is apologize and let them yell. Also, it may not say so, but scrubbing toilets and picking up dog poop will be part of your job as well.

MAA is an inclusive company that really makes you feel like you are a part of a family. I started with MAA 6 years ago as a leasing manager and our community was sold.

As someone previously noted, pay attention to the ratings pattern. Reputation means everything to MAA suits. One bad review is followed by a few glowing. Turnover is atrocious for a reason. Most new staff don't last long because they know making money for shareholders and the corporate suits it's not worth the stress they are under.

Decent commissions and renewals. GOI bonus structure allows you to make additional income.","Assistant Managers basically get the short end of the stick. Those at smaller properties always get stuck at the properties while the managers are off at ALC (annually in another state), manager meetings (monthly); leasing agents at least have the leasing rally (annually); and the assistants don't get anything. They get stuck being at the property as these aforementioned events happen. They are leasing, assistant managers, AND managers and yet don't receive enough money to compensate for all the work being done. There are some leasing agents that make MORE than an assistant but assistants do much more work overall and don't get nearly enough money. Tattoos aren't as taboo as they used to be, however, it's still a faux pas to have these showing. Tattoos shouldn't be considered a sign of being ""unprofessional"" and someone's worth. The bonus structure for delinquency could be better. Instead of being quarterly, it would be more beneficial to do it on a monthly status. Not allowing a person working alone during a week day to take a lunch isn't fair or right. The office should be able to close, even if only for thirty minutes to allow for a break. If not, overtime should be allowed more often for such occasions. Why should a leasing agent get the GOI bonus if they already receive other monetary incentives? They don't control budgets, or work to maintain delinquency or maintenance expenses. Give employees the ability to express their individuality by NOT forcing them to wear uniforms (office staff). There can and should be a happy medium. RVP and SVP's have a tendency to micromanage to the extent that it makes it so that onsite staff are almost talking in circles. Have confidence in your onsite team and management personnel to make the best call regarding residents. They have a repertoire with them and interact with them daily.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm
If you want to gain experience...,3.0,"Oct 5, 2022",Great entry level job if you're trying to get into leasing. Commissions are great at times. Great benefits. You can grow if this is something you see yourself doing for a long time.,You will be working long stretches at a time sometimes 10 days straight. And mostly weekends. Each property is different so every manager makes up their own rules. There is no type of grace period so if you're a commuter or live further from the property you might be setting yourself up. Can be overwhelming depending on the size of the property. You will be micromanaged.

Great company with continued growth,5.0,"Jan 6, 2022","Started from entry level and advanced over past 9 years. Transfers and promotions were supported. Steady growth in company leading to more opportunities and continued innovations to keep up with new technology. Lately an aggressive push on incentives have taken employment with the company over the top, especially if you live on property. The properties all vary so you can choose newer properties or old, fully staffed or not. These can lead to more of a consistent laid back preventative maintenance type property or a high stress responsive community with renovations and overtime and more learning opportunities. It’s all up to where you go and there’s always flexibility to cross over from maintenance to leasing even. Sit downs with the CEO and CFO during tours of such a big company is a rare and welcome perk. Most of their stories are ground up employees and very humble and confident leadership.",Tribal knowledge can be limiting and sometimes hold back the highest potential for development so it is encouraged to go in with as much background as you can bring or to take classes in spare time. The challenges are changing every day and so you find yourself googling a lot and can hit some hard walls. You find a lot of support but also are expected to figure it out one way or another. Calling contractors can really effect your budget so in house as much as possible really can put the pressure on. Cost of living is escaping some of the wages. They are definitely fair and catching up with the times as far as base levels and I have seen alot of incentives and bonuses that help curb overall but some areas are hit so hard with inflation there needs to be consideration of location for salary. Otherwise maintaining staff may be hard as prices drive them out. Initially I had a lot of troubles with micromanagers working up in the company. As soon as I had trust to make some decisions and mistakes I started to grow a lot faster.

There is nothing wrong with that because that is how the world works, but MAA tries to make everyone believe they are a small market company that is invested in it's employees and residents. In actuality MAA is just extremely good at selling their own brand to their employees. From the annual leadership conference to the divisional meetings they are constantly selling their brand to the managers and trying to get them to sell it to their associates. It's a successful model and would be great if the company practiced what it preached a little more in regards to how the business is run. It also seems that depending on which region or sub-region you're in could be run slightly differently. Although there is a broad set of guidelines within the company much of it is left to the determination of the SVP and RVP on how things should be handled.

"Caring, not caring",3.0,"Nov 2, 2016",Pros - I worked with a manager and assistant manager who knew their jobs and were good at them. They were respectful and understanding of the employees. Maintenance supervisor was quite organized and kept the turns on schedule. MAA seemed to care about the property and employees. They had good benefits and decent pay. I thought I was very happy there.,"Cons- maintenance technicians were very lazy and biased towards what tenants work orders they would do. Many times they would just close out the work order and never do the task. I also worked in an office with a leasing manager who thought she was the Queen. Her agreement was she got all the renewal commissions bc she sent out the letters. Yet 80% or more of the time myself and other leasing agents had to type up the leases and go over them with the tenants. There was another agent who only worked when she felt like it and the rest of the time kept her door closed and blinds pulled down. Yet nothing was ever said to her bc of her being related to the regional manager. And that leads me to my next issue. In 8 years of multi family experience, I never would live in the property I worked for so I could separate work from off time. MAA allowed me to live in a sister property with the discount. The day I took off to move, my regional manager and his boss went to my work property to announce they were selling it. When I asked them how long they had been planning that, they said all year, but yet they let me move in under the belief that I would have a discount for longer than what amounted to just 4 months. Well, while the property I worked for was for sale, they came up with a leasing trainer position of which I was referred to. My regional began to let me train up new employees in town and sent me to other states. As I made it through the interviews for this corporate trainer position (due to me having the highest leasing numbers and closing percentage in the company) I was told when the final interview would be. I arranged time out of state, as I was training people currently, so I could phone interview with them. That time came and went with no call. Once I began to ask my regional about it, he would avoid me. I feel it's because they offered the job to the other candidate that didn't fully fit the requirements and he had no desire to inform me. The other candidate openly stated on his Facebook that he wasn't that thrilled with the offer. Well, after being shunned like that, I still wanted to remain with the company. They had other openings in my town they could have transferred me to. Instead they made me interview like a non experienced lackey. Then they sent me a form letter stating how they wanted someone who understood the ideals of the company and could be a good asset. What kind of good asset are they going to find that's better at leasing than anyone in the company, who volunteered to help train new employees, who volunteered to work every rotating holiday so the employees who were married or had families could be with them.

While I completely understand the financial reasonings for merging with MAA & expanding your portfolio, I can promise you this, it is the worst mistake you could've made.

When our current CEO visits a property, they acknowledge EVERY person and they do it with enthusiasm. We've had MAA visits apart from The visits with Post Management & they walk in and do not even acknowledge staff.

MAA Review from a long term employee,1.0,"Mar 17, 2020","Job security, MAA very rarely ever sells a property and rarely ever fires employees. If you have a job with MAA, you could easily retire with the company after 30 years.","MAA over the past several years has shown they now only care about their shareholders and what they can do to make more money. There are a few examples of this. 1. The first one is that they eliminated an annual bonus in 2019 without telling their employees, when pressed on this by several employees in my region the HR department said they thought they notified us, but they must have forgotten. 2. Renewal increases have gone up drastically. Gone are the days of getting a reasonable increase 3-4%, maybe 6-7% if you were in a very robust market. Instead they are trying to push 10% or more renewal increases and letting managers know that they should just tell the residents who complain to try and find a better deal elsewhere. I personally wouldn't be able to afford a 10% renewal increase as my annual raise was only 3%. They've begun to get this attitude of we are the biggest guys in town and people will do what we want. That strategy hasn't worked well in places like Dallas or Denver, two different markets that have struggled to maintain occupancy as residents look for a property with more reasonable expectations. 3. Their response to the corona virus has essentially been to tell residents they are still to pay their rent on time and if they are late due to work circumstances changing they will still adhere to their payment policies and process evictions as necessary. They don't care about their residents and how they might be impacted, only if they will get to collect their rent check or not. 4. If you plan to move up with MAA, there is no career support for your goals. They prefer for you not to get your CAM , NALP, or even CAMT certifications. If you want to get promoted, their expectation is for you to drop everything and do what they ask of you and if you say no then your chance for promotion is essentially zero, and since they don't want you getting certifications it makes it harder to look for jobs elsewhere. 5. The pay scale is not great whatsoever and their benefits don't make up for that. Their refusal to pay market pay has led to an increased shortage of employees. Some regions have seen such high employee turnover that employees leave before even finishing their 30 day training. 6. HR is not their to protect you, they are their solely to protect MAA. This is probably a given at majority of companies, but be aware that if you go to HR they will believe you are the problem. I've seen several employees get terminated after reporting their concerns to HR when they felt their direct manager wasn't assisting them. They were told each time that they felt it was best to part ways and that a new direction was needed. 7. RVP's, you either love them or hate them. Their isn't a middle ground. Some of this isn't the RVP's faults as they being given direction from Corporate on increasing rents, making more money, reducing expenses, etc. but because of this RVP's then tend to take it out on their Property Managers which is unfortunate. 8. Increasingly those working at the Corporate Office have continued to disregard what their property managers are telling them. Pricing Calls were supposed to be a conversation about what your concerns are, and have now instead turned into your Pricing Analyst (somebody who has never worked at a property) telling you what you need to be doing to rent apartments. Fees have been changed without consulting Property Managers and seeing what their thoughts are on how it will impact the business.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm

Houston Region Issues,1.0,"Jan 26, 2020",Opportunity to advance. Company is growing,"I can't speak to other markets, but the company's core values and the way the properties operate in Houston are incredibly different. One of MAA's core values is operating with integrity, but when it comes into practice this is not the case. In the Houston market employees are consistently undervalued. They seem to have the mentality that everyone is replaceable. In 2019 there was turnover of at least 8 property managers for various reasons, but most stemming from poor leadership. Many of these managers had been with the company for 5 years or more and one going back over 10 years. When an employee asks for help you are consistently asked to consult the ever growing online database of policies and procedures. If you make a judgement decision that contradicts something from this online database you are berated by your superiors for not knowing the policy. But if you ask too many questions you will be pegged as someone not able to be independent, and forfeit any chances of being promoted. In addition to their lack of employee appreciation, MAA also actively and openly employees shady business practices when it comes to their vendors. Vendors who are willing to adjust invoices to read something different than the work that was done are able to continue working for MAA. Vendors who will not employ these shady business practices will be turned away, and replaced with vendors who will. This is all done so that work can be done and coded as a capital invoice when in actuality the work being done is a regular business expense. This is done because bonuses are based on your expense budget, and GOI. Capital expenses are completely separate, and are not part of the bonus structure for the managers. This is all being done with the knowledge of senior leadership. This type of company culture only seems to continue to get worse with each year. As more pressure is put on the markets to balance occupancy and rent growth. This constant struggle is exceedingly difficult when your direct supervisor tells you to focus occupancy over rent growth, but the company COO and CEO are constantly telling you not to give up rent growth for high occupancy. Leaving MAA was one of the best decisions of my career.",MAA,MAA,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/MAA-Reviews-E2504.htm
