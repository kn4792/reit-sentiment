Toxic Environment and Limited Career Advancement,2.0,"Mar 10, 2025","The company offers a solid benefits package that promotes a healthy work-life balance. Leadership within my department and across the company values grit and initiative, recognizing those who go above and beyond. Executives are committed to the long-term success of the company and focus on sustainable growth. However, opportunities to collaborate with others are limited, and while there is a strong sense of inclusivity when discussing the company’s future, the lack of clear advancement paths and middle management improvements hinder the overall culture.","Unfortunately, I experienced second-class treatment under my manager. Despite my hard work, I was often sidelined with fewer opportunities for advancement and recognition compared to those in favor with management. The culture encouraged snitching, which, combined with favoritism, fostered a toxic work environment. Those who aligned with management were rewarded, leaving others feeling unsupported. The uneven workload, lack of transparency, and poor communication created an atmosphere of disrespect and disillusionment, making me feel undervalued and isolated.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
