Tread carefully,3.0,"Jun 30, 2023",Top-notch benefits and PTO Nice offices/workspaces,"The company has grown so fast that workloads are unmanageable and unsustainable workloads. Leadership is unwilling to hire more people to cover the additional work (or claim there are ""hiring freezes"" when there actually aren't). Hourly employees work off the clock regularly to barely stay afloat and are expected not to complain about it. Leadership then gets upset when people are behind on their work. Communication is very top-down and executives do not take real concerns (e.g., unsustainable workloads and low pay) seriously. They claim they are listening via engagement surveys and town halls, then say they don't understand why people are unhappy. Employees have been leaving in droves. Below-market pay across the board. The benefits are outstanding so they tout this as why they can pay less. No accountability for poorly performing employees After COVID, departments were allowed to choose when their teams were required to be in the office (if at all), plus many people were hired as fully remote during the pandemic. The office was mostly empty most of the time when I was there so there was no real sense of team culture.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm

Executive leadership does not care about employees,2.0,"May 29, 2022",Good benefits but pay is very low for the industry,"Executive leadership is showing it does not care about its employees. Even though we have a hybrid schedule, HR reps walk the halls to tattle to the CEO if people are not always at their desks. Long-time employees and leaders are leaving in droves. I am truly worried for the success of the company. The executives care about having people at their desks at the expense of everything else. Throughout the pandemic, employees of every level proved themselves by working hard and breaking productivity records and company financial success. Also throughout the pandemic, the CEO promised we would have continued flexibility after the pandemic, but that is proving not to be the case. Employees have thrived and adapted through a merger and a pandemic, enduring great stress and change, and the company does not care about the employees. The company will not succeed if it does not start listening. The co-workers that haven’t yet left are all searching for other work, and approximately half of the company already has no idea how to do their job. Working here is utter chaos. It will be even worse if the executives do not change and listen.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
Excellent Company with Growth Opportunities,5.0,"Nov 15, 2017","The company has great benefits and you are only required to work half days on Fridays, so every weekend feels like a three day weekend to me! There is fresh fruit provided in the kitchen on Mondays & Wednesdays, quarterly company luncheons, fun company outings and baking competitions, etc. I've worked for many companies who didn't value their employees, so I really appreciate working for this company and how they really seem to care about the well-being of the staff. They have a weekly boot-camp workout at lunch available, and have offered weekly yoga class and meditation classes in the conference room since I've worked here. Average tenure is around 6 years, I've witnessed many coworkers who have celebrated their 5, 10, 15 and 20 year work anniversaries in the past year that I've been here as well.","The departments do not communicate very efficiently, and usually one department has no clue what any other is doing, but I am hoping that information will be more easily accessible cross-departmentally once the new property management system is in place.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
Turning Into Not the Best Place to Work,2.0,"May 25, 2022",Great Health Benefits and Generous PTO,"Company morale is low and upper management doesn’t listen to their employees. You can see how the company has morphed from a great family feel to a corporate giant that doesn’t seem to care as much about their employees and only cares about the bottom line. Employees are overworked and expected to take on extra workload as the company grows too fast for teams to handle which leads to people scrambling to complete their work and many people working long hours. Base compensation is low compared to other companies. They will pay more for outside talent instead of employees who prove their worth and has been at the company for years. They are not flexible with remote work and employees are expected to be in the office 3 times a week even though some employees are provided with full time remote opportunities. If you’re an exempt employee, half day Fridays don’t mean anything because you are still expected to work to meet tight deadlines. More long term employees have been leaving.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
Growing company but low compensation,3.0,"Mar 29, 2022","Great benefits, work/life balance is fair, nice people, job security",Total compensation is not competitive at any level below VP. Salaries for tenured employees are often less than new hires because they have trouble hiring talent at what they pay their current employees that have been around for 5+ years. Turnover increasing every year. Top talent is leaving to get paid double somewhere else and the company seems to be ok with not paying to keep top performers. It has gotten very corporate; lots of new hires all the time and culture is non-existent anymore. Realty Income has loss all sense of the family feel it once represented and now is solely about growth at the expense of keeping overhead and salaries at a minimum.,Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
Poor Company Culture,1.0,"Apr 12, 2022",Great benefits and half day Friday’s.,"Poor company culture. Upper management doesn’t take constructive feedback from employees to improve anything. Departments don’t communicate with each other and there is a lot of disorganization when it comes to proper procedures. There is no work life balance. Company team building events can be uncomfortable and feel forced. There is no dedicated trainer for the company so if you get hired remotely be prepared to sink or swim. I’ve seen some employees work remotely while others were forced to return to the office after two years of working remotely. We also were given a return to work date probably 6 times and it kept getting rescheduled so each time your life had to pause and reset not knowing if this was the time we really had to go back. HR didn’t seem to care that they were inconveniencing everyone repeatedly. There is a lot of office politics, more than normal. Their practices are not fair and a lot of people are quitting.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
Highly undervalued and underpaid,2.0,"Jan 26, 2023","Half day Fridays, benefits, PTO","Workers are grossly underpaid for the workload and amount of hours needed to meet strict deadlines. There is a revolving door on analysts. Most have a life expectancy of 1-2 years before moving onto a company that pays fairly (sometimes almost double). Not to mention, you are required to return to office even though it’s impossible to live on their analyst salary in San Diego. As for the company as a whole, long-time employees have left and are continuing to leave due to management’s disregard for their employees. The company has changed from a successful, “family feel” with some of the best talent to a culture-less corporate machine. Used to be a great company but unfortunately it is going downhill.",Realty Income Corporation,O,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Realty-Income-Reviews-E3890.htm
