Amazing Company!,5.0,"May 5, 2016","I've been working here at Hudson for about 2 years now and it's been a great experience. What i love most are the people that work here. The people that you work with is what sets the tone for the work environment. To me that's very important because you spend most of your day with these people right? Employees here work hard but we still know how to have fun from time to time. Another great thing about the company is that we're not as stiff as most corporate offices, the office is quite lax and i think it'll continue being this way as long as people get their work done. As far as my department, i feel like i got pretty lucky. I enjoy working in my teammates and I appreciate their patience with teaching me and showing me new things. I continue to learn something new every day here. And I definitely cannot forget to mention how AWESOME the CEO is. He is extremely generous and really cares about the employees at Hudson. I've heard some amazing stories about him from people that's been with him since the Arden days. It shows a great deal when people have continued to follow him even after he sold Arden and started Hudson.",There's not a lot of cons i can think of.

Steer clear of any and all employment opportunities at the predatory company,1.0,"Feb 7, 2015",Growth orientated and acquisition centric,"The shear lack of a true management team at this company is outstanding. The corporate structure here is a boys club of buddies from the CEO's former company, where advancement is based on relationships and politics and not merit. No middle management to speak of, with the executive team covering their behinds vs mentoring their teams. The key executives are making bank and everyone else is overworked, underpaid and unappreciated. Rather than paying deserving employees what is market, they waste money on lunches and private jets. HR is dispised across the board and the admin EA's are self important and have undue influence and run rough shot over even managerial level staff. Rather than value skilled work, they value face time! To be recognized you have to seem to be putting in 24/7 hours.

They are top heavy in management with overpaid mid managers that don’t have any idea on how to run tv/film studios. They promote playing favorites and don’t recognize the employees who work hard at their jobs. Management doesn’t promote based on true merit, they seem to only promote those who will just stay quite and fall inline.

A start-up tech feel in a modern corporate culture,5.0,"Jun 17, 2016","The crux with sites like this is that everyone who is disgruntled or out for revenge is so quick to take to the “interweb” and air their grievances. Like Festivus is actually a real thing and they are so cleaver to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes and show how they were made a victim. In my lifetime of work experience, there’s always a valid reason why people are listed as “former” employees. A valid reason. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, perfectly happy, content employees are too busy doing their jobs to feel the need to broadcast to the world of how great they truly have it. Perhaps that’s a mistake on our part. One I intend to correct immediately. Hudson is not perfect. I have never met anyone here who has claimed otherwise. But, I have known that this company was special from the moment I stepped foot onto their property. Contrary to urban myth, there has never been a table of Kool-Aid set up for all new employees to drink. They don’t need to. The Kool-Aid is in the way the company is run, from the top-down. Open door policy? Check. Work-life balance? Check. Recognizing an employee’s commitment to go above and beyond? Check. Collaborative work force? Check. Perks? Check. Ability to grow? Check. I could go on and on here, but I think you get the picture. Hudson also has a very progressive mentality regarding change. They are not afraid to embrace it. Knowing that the past trends of the urban workforce may not be the most productive will never be set in stone with this company. The CEO is open to new things and excited to implement them. Like any job, I have my good days and my bad days. But, overall, they are mostly good and I’m incredibly fortunate and happy to be employed at Hudson.","It’s always a slippery slope when this subject is brought up, but there’s definitely a discrepancy in the XX to XY chromosome ratio in the senior management team. But let me clarify my, ahem, ""criticism"" for a moment. The current senior management team is comprised of amazing people with incredible talent who are truly shining stars in their respective roles. I don’t want to see more women in senior management to just fill a void. I also don’t want to see Hudson labeled as a “Boys Club” because it’s so much more than that. I want strong, intelligent and capable women to take more senior leadership roles alongside the current male heads of state.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

"Nice perks, bad management & HR",2.0,"Jun 16, 2017","Free lunches, free breakfast, good benefits, half day Fridays.","Hiring new people is a mess. They hire friends of management and executives, who don't actually want to work there, but get ridiculously high salaries. People who have been there for 10+ years have the job because they were there from the beginning, not because they are amazing employees. All of the interns that were hired were family or friends of executives, making it a nightmare to manage. TOTAL Boys club. Not many women can work there way to the top at HPP. HR is a disaster. Terrible, terrible HR staff. I've seen better HR management at small start-ups. There is no 'Open door policy' here, even though they want you to think there is. If you tell HR any concerns, they'll use it against you. If you're having any other issues, they will simply ignore you and not deal with situations. If there are any employees that are not meeting company standards, they simple demote them, and move them around the office, making the morale and work flow even worse. They do not know how to handle any problems or sticky situations, they'd rather ignore and cover it up with bandaids. Employee retention not great. A lot of turn over due to the extremely slow promotion rate. Again, you can get a promotion here easily if you know someone, if you are a ""random"" hire , hire based on skills and resume, most likely you will stay in your position for a very long time. Management is a mess, very toxic environment. If you're not a manager, it is VERY well known you're not. ie: ""retreats"", lots of closed door meetings, lots of management outings, and the lower level employees are not appreciated.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

Best in Class,5.0,"Jun 27, 2016","I've been with this company for a few years and watched it grow from having fewer than 50 employees in LA to a team of 250+ across a portfolio in major cities up and down the West Coast. Leadership has managed to keep priorities consistent over time -- they stress teamwork, collaboration and hard work, all while underscoring the importance of having fun together, and, of course, delivering best in class product and client service. Which, if you ask me, is about the most satisfying combination of goals for a company to tout. And they don't just talk the talk; the perqs of working at Hudson include state of the art work spaces, company outings, summer half day Fridays, stocked kitchens, catered lunches, and just about any other amenity you could want. All of it, of course, is designed to make the average employee feel as happy at work as possible, because Hudson gets it: happy employees = productive employees. I honestly can't speak to the experiences some have had regarding cliques and power, but I would not be the least bit surprised if the folks writing those reviews had some of their own issues going on. There will always be naysayers, but if you ask the average Hudson employee to give you a candid assessment of working here, I'd be surprised if you didn't get a completely positive, hopeful report. Not to mention that because there is such a premium on corporate culture and vision, recruiting is careful to select individuals who clearly embody the qualities mentioned above.

"Good from far, far from good",1.0,"Sep 13, 2018",The corporate office space is brand new and really nice. They have a kitchen with free food and drinks. On the surface it's a pretty cool place to work.,"1) The vast majority of the most important people at Hudson either worked with the CEO at his previous company or had some other pre-existing relationship. The board is an old boys' club and so is most of the executive team. As such, the culture at the top is very insular and that has negative effects for new employees and people at the bottom. 2) Company-wide communication is pretty much non-existent; there were at least a half dozen instances in which they bought a new building or sold an existing building but never bothered to tell any of the people who weren't directly involved with the transaction. Most employees didn't find out until reading the press releases. 3) If you run into any kind of HR issue that negatively affects your work and you don't have any ""friends at the top"" then my sincere advice is this: skip the HR department and start looking for an escape route. I watched multiple people try to make formal complaints about harassment, retaliation, etc and not only was there no action taken, the HR department didn't even bother to write anything down or pretend to investigate. I'm actually being pretty diplomatic - the reality is that there are some unprofessional, toxic people working at various levels of the company and HR actively enables them through some combination of malice and incompetence. I imagine it's only a matter of time before the company gets hit with a harassment or discrimination lawsuit, if it hasn't already.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm
