"Work, Work balance",3.0,"Aug 28, 2023",You will learn volumes and the pay is pretty good*,"*The pay is pretty good if you were to only work 40-50 hours a week*The teams are not put together well and they are severely understaffed. Some individuals doing the bare minimum, with no consequences. At the same time, others are expected to review work at home and remain on site longer than they already are. While this is a typical story, it is extreme here. The teams should be staffed with twice the personnel, possibly more. If you plan on leaving, make sure to burn up your PTO because they will NOT pay more than 40 hours of accrued time.

Horrible job,2.0,"Jan 28, 2020",Good benefits and good pay,"This is a fine place to work if you only care about your job and do not want to have a life outside of work. The management could not care less about what you have going on in your personal life; to them, work should be the #1 priority in your life. You will stay late more times than you will get to leave on time (by far). You can try to leave on time, but you will likely get told that you actually need to stay until 9:00pm anyway. Working here was the worst experience of my life and driving out of the garage on my last day was one of the happiest moments of my life. I felt like a huge weight was lifted the day I left that place.","Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc.",AHH,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Armada-Hoffler-Properties-Reviews-E342533.htm
