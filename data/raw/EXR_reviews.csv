One of the easiest jobs you could have,4.0,"Nov 11, 2025","One of the easiest, if not, stressless jobs you can probably have as an Assistant Store Manager anywhere. No hard sales, no cold calls and no pressure that keeps you awake at night. If you can talk to people without an attitude and aren't completely lazy, you have a shot at a job that makes a bit more than minimum wage and keeps you away from the high stress of retail stores. Hours are basic with Sundays plus one (non-busy) weekday off every week.","The National Sales Center just straight up does not tell anyone who rents about how pricing works, rental increases and advance payments work. 90% of the time, we are relaying information that the NSC should have provided the day of rental over the phone but the customers are always baffled by the lack of information and training the NSC was given when presented at the store. NSC needs to know how thin the line is between lying and just not telling the customer information at the sake of a sale.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

EXTRA Fake Culture,1.0,"Jul 23, 2025",I like the AM work hours,"I do not agree with the amount of perfect practices they make their employees endure. We have a once a week district call and 2 yearly district meetings. The company's values is fake and they have the ""you get what you pay for demeanor"". Since working here the customers complain about the constant Rate increases and the significant jump since they took over Life Storage. The company pushes staff to sell CPP ( Insurance) but make it optional and then try to coach employees on how to basically convince customers they need an additional monthly fee. Their is absolutely no Over Time and they ensure we do not go over time. We are always short staffed, and the DM is condescending at times with his leadership. The job is very repetitive and key word for this company is EXTRA, the customers complain the company is a Bait and switch, and also for staff. Upon being hired they do not tell you the AM will be getting paid less but to do the exact same job as the SM. They force the AM to do the SM job with different pay and less of the monthly bonus because the DM gets apart of the monthly bonus as well. I came in making $19 and got a .57 cent pay raise on my yearly review.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Review During Promotion,5.0,"Oct 23, 2025",I like that fact that they look to promote from inside the company before looking outside the company. The people I work with are all so kind and are always willing to answer any questions.,"The main con I can think of is that the CPP % counts parking.

As long as your district is fully staffed, work-life balance is pretty good.","Upper management places too much focus on metrics and not supporting the people who work at properties. Too often, you are left working a site alone with last minute call offs or not enough staff to provide you the help that you need. Company culture has moved in the direction of being totalitarian. Some customer can be erratic due to drug use, which can be scary. There is fear of coming into contact with dangerous substances when having to enter a customers storage unit due to our auction process (Or for any other reason...). Pay is relatively low for the market considering cost of living has gone up exponentially, but pay has stayed low. There are not that many holidays that are recognized, so you will be stuck working on most holidays. Facility audits are intense and stressful. There are many opportunities for failure in sections of the audit that are out of your control. There is still no sick leave and management just claims that this is all been rolled into one large amount of PTO.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

You could potentially shine and earn a maximum 4% raise, or you could switch companies and secure a 20% salary increase for doing the same job. While growth opportunities are claimed to be available, they often require relocating to a different state for the role you want, and positions like DTL, DMIT, and DM are rarely available. Corporates anti-consumer practices, such as raising rates by over 100% a month, Creating frustration for employees who lack power and must deal with negative customer reactions. Be prepared to work independently frequently, as short staffing leads to long commutes across numerous locations, with many managers being hired simply to fill positions rather than based on the right qualifications. This often leaves other managers picking up the slack, as they can't adequately cover their sites. Managers are allowed to apply different rules at their locations, making the job more complicated. There is too much flexibility in expectations, leading to major favoritism.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

I've had the experience of working in multiple roles at ESS, starting as an Assistant Site Manager, getting quickly promoted to Site Manager, then, due to personal reasons, transferring to a call center position. In each of these roles, I had caring supervisors, involved district management, and interested higher management. A lot of companies talk about ""culture"", but the culture they describe is nothing like the actual culture an employee experiences. At ESS, it isn't just lip service.

During my interviewing process with the DTLS and DM I was made promises like most employers make (most employers lie to you) but ESS has done way more than kept their promises but they have also gone above and beyond in the dark hours of need. This is the only employer who I have worked for that has honored their core values and makes sure their employees are happy. My District Manager is also the best DM I have ever worked under. They make the workplace fun and for once I am not scared to see their car pull up in my parking lot. Its a good day when they come to visit unlike my past events at former retail chains i worked for.

Extra Space Storage - Facilities Department,3.0,"Aug 8, 2024","Extra Space Storage offers a generally positive working environment. The company's overall culture promotes inclusivity and values employee contributions. Compensation and benefits are competitive, aligning well with industry standards. There are ample opportunities for career growth and development within most departments in the company. The company’s mission and values are clear, and it strives to maintain a customer-focused approach.","The leadership in the Facilities department is notably rigid and controlling. This contrasts sharply with the company's broader culture. Facilities employees are not afforded the same perks or benefits as other home office employees, such as hybrid work schedules. Unless traveling to sites, Facilities staff are required to be physically present in the office. The leadership within this department rarely, if ever, offers praise or recognition for the team's hard work and accomplishments. Instead, the feedback tends to focus predominantly on what is being done wrong, creating a negative atmosphere. The morale within the Facilities team is low, with many employees actively seeking other opportunities, both within the company and externally.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Customers and the $ bottom line are the ultimate goals they emphasize. Overall, the company goals are fairly easy to achieve as long as you are following the processes and the training the company emphasizes on a regular basis.","The position is heavily centric on customer service which can be challenging at times especially working with the general public We are the face of the company and if the customer has experienced a rate increase or another problem with our company, we are required to try and de-escalate and calm angry or upset customers. We can experience run -ins with people that are living in or stealing from our facilities. It feels like we are almost police at times in that you have to stand your ground with unstable people. It can be unnerving at times especially since the store is usually only run by 1-2 people.

I like that every day is a little different and you aren't stuck in an office, you are outside cleaning and managing your property, as well.","The downsides of storage are definitely break-ins, possible pest issues, leaks, etc and having to have those hard conversations with customers.

Also the senior leadership team is very down to earth and it feels like a small family business - even though we are the largest self store business in the country. I had a hard time finding a company that was willing to take a shot on me after being laid off from my prior employer, as I was not relocatable and had worked several years in the fitness industry.

Work life balance is not great because someone else writes your schedule. It's rare to get two days off in a row. You will get micromanaged by most District Managers.

My Honest Opinion,4.0,"Apr 30, 2024","Core Values and Teamwork: : In my opinion, ESS thrives on it's core values (ITPIE); our DMs not only talk about it, but they embody these values. We are a functional team, and working with each other to achieve the best possible outcome. Work/Life Balance: ESS provides a very good work life balance, in the short while I've been here, District Managers that I've worked with respect life changes and work with you. There's a lot of flexibility as it pertains to scheduling.. Work time is from 9:30am to 6pm, You really can't beat that. Compensation: Having evaluated the MAJOR competitors (I don't think I am allowed to mention them on here), managers at the store level I believe is compensated slightly better when it comes to the industry. Customer and Value: I believe company has better customer value in comparison to it's competitors, at least in my area and company is very right in translating that value in form of pricing. In a nutshell, we have more ""Valuable"" Customers with less headaches than our competitors.","Lack of Growth/No Upward Trajectory: As a store manager, just like most organizations, there's no Retail-To-Corporate Path. I guess there's no encouragement for employees to improve themselves and academics to go up the ladder. Once you're a store manager, that's it. Just my opinion Metrics and Performance: Company relies on metrics which folks at the store level has no control over. For instance, you can't judge me if a customer doesn't rent or a customer who calls the store support center multiple times and complain because they're not having their way. I feel the metrics are an inaccurate indicator of one's performance but again, Just my opinion.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Hours are still being used up in both stores… keep the people assigned to stores in their stores to help their customers that they have built rapport with. On top of this, I was hired with the pitch that you get mileage and drive time, but the mileage you claim is the difference of what you actually drive and your normal drive. Then they did away with travel time because too many people were having to leave early. Inconsistent scheduling that makes no sense.

As I worked more over the last couple years, and started helping in other states, districts, and divisions, it is all over the company. It is incredible how much everyone works together! And the leadership is always looking out for their teams!",None! Honestly... nothing! I don't have a single bad thing to say about this company.,"Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Could be so much better,3.0,"Feb 8, 2025","The goal is to make you a manger so unless you just dont make the cut you will become a manager. Once you become a manger you will have your own store and pretty much be able to do a lot of things your way, within the guidelines of course. You will work by yourself mostly so that cuts out a lot of work place drama but you will need to be the kind of person that doesnt need a lot of supervision and can handle being alone 90 percent of the time. The golf cart and power tools are fun. The work is mostly easy. Cleaning units is usually basic not too crazy most of the time. You can go outside when you want to and you come back in the office when you want, Your not too micromanaged. The benefits are okay nothing spectacular but they do give you a wellness credit and there is choices so that is nice.","The split days off are hard if you have kids or are a caretaker, especially if you are single with kids or caretaking; you will constantly be playing catch up in your personal life. The work life balance that they brag about isnt really all that great. You will start at 930 and get off at 6, late start but its still a long day. We only get 5 holidays off, The big 3 day holidays, Memorial and Labor Day, we just sit here, Most of the time you will go hours without seeing anyone. There is no option for part time hours, only part time days. You will work almost every Saturday until 530, I only earn 4.62 hrs PTO every 2 weeks, It takes forever to earn enough to take a week off and you dont get any sick time or vacation time so you have to use PTO for everything. The google and mobile app review is ridiculous. They do not advertise so they push you to get google reviews every month and there is no compensation or bonus for that and the new mobile app metric is ridiculous. If people do not want their app on their phone you get bad numbers. They raise people's rent for no reason, to ridiculous amounts, more than apartment raises and customers call yelling at you, but they dont want you to tell them its headquarters, they just want you to take the verbal abuse. There is no long term customer reward and you take the hit for that, by customers and in your numbers. The pay is ""okay"", just average, its not the worst but considering how they brag about their profits it could be better. Also you will deal with homeless people trying to live in their units and then you have to go through all kinds of changes to get rid of them- being threatened, cleaning up poop, fixing destroyed units, all because they want to collect one more months rent. Sometimes it feels like they really dont care about our safety, only the months rent. Also once you become a manager there is not a lot of options unless you are willing to relocate and jump thru hoops.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Some pros but a lot of cons,1.0,"Mar 16, 2025","The main pro is that unless you are in the cities, the job is extremely easy. Even in the cities, the actual job is fine, it is just you have increased customer interaction. The other pro is the work-life balance. The only time you ever have to deal with something off hours is when there is an emergency.","For starters, the pay is not great. They almost have like a vendetta against paying overtime. They try to act like they are making it better by paying you a bonus at the end of the month based on your rentals. However, for most sites you are maybe looking at an extra $50 - $150 depending on where you are. And they lower the incentive that you get per rental during busy season, they claim that due to the higher number of rentals that it evens out. That being said the number of rentals are not guaranteed. For example, they raised our rates so high that we did not get rentals to the point we ended up with 30 less rentals then the same month a year prior. In terms of pay and abilities, moving up in the company is really not worth it depending on what your goals are. If one of your goals is learning about the business, this is not the place. Whether you are with the company or not, you can find the information. You will probably have to do the same amount of digging. Despite the company claiming transparency, they are anything but. If you ask the company 10 questions, you will get the answer to maybe one of them. They love to give long winded responses that do not answer the question. You could also get as specific as possible and format a question by stating the information that you know, and then saying but you would like to know. 9 times out of 10 they will give you a response, restating everything you said you knew and not answer the question. Another con is that your previous work experience does not really mean anything to them. They will speak to you in such a cookie cutter way, that it can be very condescending. Even if you have been there a while and know your clientele, they act like you don't know anything. Despite the fact that when you survey all the guests, 80% of them would make a statement consistent of them staying there due to the office management. The amount of guests that make statements how they do not like the company but like us is astounding. Extra Space benefits greatly off of us and the fact that other companies seem to have employees that really do not care. I could go on, but to put it into perspective, I have talked to loads of people who have been here for 5+ years and they all have stated that this is just a job, not a career. There are also loads of people who were interested in the job and are now contemplating leaving. The only thing keeping them is how easy the job is.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Becoming a Storage Warrior: Tales from the Vault,5.0,"Jan 2, 2025","The Power of the Key Ring: There is a moment when you become the keymaster. Every customer who walks in looks to you like you're holding the Ark of the Covenant. And guess what? You are! No one else can enter the sacred storage chambers without your mighty key ring. It's basically a medieval dungeon master's staff, except more polished and with fewer dragons. The Warehouse Gym: Sure, you came to work thinking you were just going to move some boxes, but by the end of the week, you’re basically an Olympic athlete. Lifting cleaning bottles, climbing ladders, and restalking.5 lb-pound boxes into small spaces on the merch wall? All in a day's work. If you're looking to replace your gym membership, just sign up here and get the ""Storage Arms"" of Hercules. Customer Interactions that Feel Like You’re in a Sitcom: Every day, you get to meet characters straight out of a sitcom. There’s the overly dramatic person who insists their belongings are “more valuable than gold,"" the confused customer who thought they were renting a mini fridge (yep, it’s a storage unit, not an appliance), and of course, the person who insists you’ve “misplaced” their stuff…even though it's right in front of them. The Sweet Smell of Opportunity: Every time you step foot into the office, you’re greeted by the sweet, sweet scent of...box tape and fabreeze air fresheners. But really, the smell of success. Bonus points if you catch the faint whiff of adventure that comes from telling customers their units are most likely ""the most secure in the business."" The Secret Handshake (AKA, The Paperwork): You become a master at paperwork. While other people quiver at the sight of a lease, you look at it with the confidence of someone who’s been there, done that, and filled out every last signature. Your signature game? Stronger than a superhero’s.","Your Car Will Never Look Clean Again: You know how some people take pride in keeping their car spotless? Well, prepare to abandon that dream. When you're constantly surrounded by boxes, bags, and ""miscellaneous"" items, your car will start looking like it was a part of a sale on ""pre-owned vehicles."" But hey, it's a good conversation starter. The ""Tetris Master"" You Never Asked to Be: You will become a Tetris god, and by ""god,"" I mean someone who spends hours trying to figure out how to stack 15 couches, a dining room set, and a mattress the size of a small yacht into a unit that’s half the size of a football field. Your brain will be forever marked by the deep question: “Will this fit in a 10x10 unit?” The Endless Question: ""What About The Temperature?"" ""Is this unit climate-controlled?"" they ask. Of course it is, Karen. Sure, it’s the temperature of whatever nature says it is, but try not to bring it up every time a customer asks. The answer is always the same: Yes, we care about your stuff as much as you do. Now, please don’t ask me if your 87 pairs of boots will be fine. The Creepy Crawlies: Sometimes you will encounter the occasional uninvited guest. And by guest, I mean spiders. And by occasional, I mean several times a day. Do you know how hard it is to look professional when you’re fighting off a web that somehow attaches to your hair like it’s auditioning for a role in a heads and shoulders commercial? The Paper Trail of Doom: It's not that you don’t like filling out forms—okay, who are we kidding, you don’t. There’s always something that needs to be filled out: ID verification, rental agreements, damage reports, or a ""So Sorry, Your Unit Is Missing, But We’ll Help You Find It"" form (that one's fun). It's like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it's stacks of paperwork.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

After Merger, we are making in a YEAR with Extra Space (on average), what we were making what we made QUARTERLY with Life Storage. So the biggest advice I do have for ES, is a better bonus structure. Because we only bonus off of the amount of move ins. And that is out of our control to an extent. If 10 reviews a month are mandatory, make an incentive to get them. No bonus for merch sales anymore as well. Not enough paid time off. Another bad thing about the merger, we lost a lost of PTO. Personally I lost 60 hours because we only have very few paid holidays.

Terrible at Communication,3.0,"Dec 5, 2024","Depending on where you work, you tend to have a lot of downtime on your hands, which you can use to work a second job (virtually) and get paid twice over for the same time. There is a very low bar for excellence which focuses on number manipulation, so if you're good at that and it doesn't bother your conscience, then you can move up quickly in this company.","This company has a few major issues which will always hold it back. The 1st is how poorly they communicate within their own operations. Changes get made and they never inform the store at the store level until 1-2 months after they did it. Everyone is different, but many of the DTL's and DM's in numerous districts tend to gatekeep information, which hurts their team. The other major issue is that their values are too numerous and all over the place. They have 17 different values which are often times in conflict with each other on any given day, but everything is always important. And lastly, their focus on numbers and nothing else breeds a certain kind of person that learns to manipulate the numbers to show them as a great employee when they're not even a good person. Turning away customers just because they're not going to get the CPP/merch/easypay and upsetting them enough to leave a 1 star review on Google, still keeps your store's numbers looking good and your review interaction high (despite the rating). That's the absolute wrong focus to incentivize on and it's no wonder why customers are always looking to rent somewhere else.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

So far so good!,4.0,"Dec 4, 2024","Depending on your location and what type of facility you are running, the pay is decent. I think that the ones who work in an outdoor facility need to make a little more than those who run an indoor facility due to the increase in manual labor for the upkeep of the facility. Sundays off is a big perk for me. I like having a weekend day off for family, friends, or life balance. After working over 20 years in traditional retail, this is a nice balance between customer service and facility upkeep. I like that any mileage you accure by traveling to other locations is directly entered into your timecard. I've worked for other companies and the worst one didn't pay your mileage for almost 3 weeks. There's efficiency in their infrastructure here. Communication between my trainer, other co workers, and direct supervisors has be friendly and helpful-no drama so far! Most of the software has a good help system, so if you prefer to learn on your own you can. I like that there feels like there's a infrastructure that is built with the company that promotes a good work experience for staff.","The training focuses a little too much on the selling and less on site upkeep, which can be overwhelming when you're finally on your own and don't know how to do things. Pay could be better with the way cost of living has increased. Pay for out door unit workers should be more than indoors due to the increased labor. The website really should promote that the sales on the units are temporary so that customers aren't suprised when rates increase after. All corporate storage facilities have the same practices, but the lack of transparency to the customer makes retaining clients difficult. Customers wish we had longer lease options rather month to month, but I understand why we don't. Depending on how far you want to go, there might not be promotions available to you if you don't relocate.

"""Great People, Poor Leadership, and Unsustainable Growth""",2.0,"Oct 11, 2024","The employees at Extra Space Storage are truly exceptional. They are dedicated, hardworking, and some of the best colleagues you could hope to meet. Their passion and commitment to their work are what keep the company moving forward, often going above and beyond to meet expectations despite challenging circumstances. The team spirit and camaraderie are what make working here feel special, and it's their tireless efforts that drive the company’s success.","While Extra Space Storage may seem like an appealing company on the surface, it's one to approach with caution. The rapid growth hasn't been matched with proper scaling, leaving the company stretched thin. Leadership operates with a small-business mindset, continually applying growth strategies that are unsustainable at the current scale. The employees are truly incredible, some of the best people you could hope to work with. However, this creates a false sense of culture that masks deeper issues. Beneath the surface, there's a company culture that leans heavily on personal relationships, which can feel like manipulation to keep up appearances Upper management operates like a ""cool kids' club."" If you're not part of their inner circle, your voice simply won't be heard, no matter how much data or how many well-thought-out recommendations you bring forward. They're out of touch with the real work needed to support their ever-growing initiatives and dismiss the concerns of mid-management about morale and workload. Burnout is seen as a weakness rather than a signal of an overloaded system, with management implying that those affected simply don't work hard enough.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

This is not fair. You do not get Saturday's unless you use your hard earned PTO time. It's Mandatory that you work Saturday's and Monday's unless you use PTO time and its granted.

It's not the worst,2.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Schedule is pretty consistent, and you have a fair amount of autonomy since upper management isn't physically there most of the time (store managers technically don't have any authority over assistant managers).

It's not hard but there can be a lot to do especially if you're at a busy location (you're a receptionist, retail manager, sales person, janitor, and facility manager all at once). If you consistently keep up with everything though you can have a lot of free time which is nice.","Pay is not good for the amount of responsibility you have (I'm getting paid just under $20/hr as an SM) and any bonuses are heavily taxed. There is definitely a gap between what different genders get paid. They also expect you to keep your wages a secret even though it's literally illegal to enforce that. Little to no overtime available. They may have you work at different stores (especially if you're an assistant manager) so it can be a long commute. Also be prepared to work alone most of the time because there's a high turnover rate and staffing is limited. They also expect you to get 10 google reviews a month which is a hassle You'll also be expected to help out other stores in your district, which is okay but ""helping"" often turns into doing someone else's work for them & cleaning up after them with little to no reward.

It’s an easy job,3.0,"Nov 15, 2023","Some pros are that the people you work with are great. The job is simple and straight forward, you don’t need any experience to get an assistant manager position.

You can’t get Saturdays off no matter what. It is required you work Saturdays and Mondays which can be annoying bc you never get two days in a row off so basically you never get a weekend. They talk about work life balance but working until 6 everyday it’s already dark when you get home. With no time to really spend time with friends and loved ones.

An Employer That Cares,5.0,"Mar 6, 2023",I have been with Extra Space for nearly 6 years. I never thought I would be working in the storage industry but I can say it is one of the best things that has happened to me. I have worked in for a corporation before and it was not a healthy environment. I can say that Extra Space is one of the best companies I have ever worked for and one that truly cares about it's employees. I have been able to work my way up from an assistant site manager to my current position as a team lead. This shows that Extra Space stands behind their people and are willing to help them to develop a career. The growth potential is only limited to the employees. I truly enjoy that when I go home at night I do not take my work home with me and I am able to spend quality time with my family. Extra Space promotes and has as a core value the importance of work/life balance. There are many companies out there that take from their employees without caring for them. This can not be said for Extra Space. There are way more PROS working for Extra Space than CONS. As this review is already lengthy I will end it by saying that Extra Space is a fantastic place to work with upper management who care about every single one of us.,"There is only one true CON I can think of and that would be having the ability to only being open a half day on Saturdays. Though the weekends are typically higher value days, there are several Saturdays were I may not even talk to someone.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Hands On Customer Service!,4.0,"Jul 13, 2023","If you enjoy customer service and working with your hands this is the place for you! Every day is full of variety. From the people you meet to the tasks you perform, there is something new around every corner. The customer service aspect is, probably, the most important as many don't realize that needing storage usually involves some kind of serious stress or life change for the person needing it. It's rewarding to be able to make something easier for someone who is going through a difficult time. The other half of the job is working with your hands and getting to be outside instead of in an office all the time. Maintaining the property, fixing things yourself and keeping things running smoothly brings a great sense of accomplishment.","Well, they are sort of the same. That ""working outside"" part can be a bit of a challenge during times of extreme weather and a stressed out customer can be difficult to deal with. But at the end of a 105 degree day (or an ice day) I think I feel a little more proud of myself for being able to power through.

Great job and great benefits,5.0,"Apr 6, 2023","I enjoy working at ESS because of many reasons! some reasons are: SUNDAYS WERE OFF!!, work day ends at 6pm, employees are awesome to work with, the company really cares about their employees, there are always ways to grow in the company (ESS will try to hire within the company before outside). While there are many other reasons these are just a few that intrigued me to want to work for ESS!","Holidays. ESS provides 4.5 paid holidays for its full-time facility employees, unless additional holidays are state mandated. We do not get enough paid holidays off. Which is very hard when you have kids. Another con is when an employee has worked at ESS for many years and hits the ""cap"" for hourly pay. They no longer get any increases. This is upsetting due to the fact at the end of the year everyone gets a merit review which is when you would get an increase of pay depending on your performance throughout the year and these people are no longer able to get an increase of pay. This is something that needs to change ASAP! How do you expect to keep an employee for over 15 years but not give any incentive to stay with the company? there should not be a ""cap"" for field employees and if the ""cap"" is to stay in place there should be other ways ie. bonus checks cut to employees that have hit the ""cap"" to compensate for not getting an increase in their hourly rate of pay.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Personally, don't care for property management & borderline harassment of customers/tenants. Also, the company expects you to follow a script to the tee, especially when being reviewed on your performance (being ""shopped"" - in person or on the phone). As with all companies, the goals are to get more, more, more. More reviews, more money (insurance), etc. Some expectations are a little more difficult to meet than others. One last item - being an ASM, you'll be expected to travel to sister sites when they need coverage (which is why they ask if you have reliable transportation). While there is mileage reimbursement, they calculate the distance for you & if you don't match it, there are going to be issues. Never mind traffic delays, detours, and wanting to arrive at the job on time; just make sure to get Google Maps to track your trips & timing, so there is no discussion of trying to take a longer route to get more money.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

As a 4 day/10 hour worker, I have to work 4 months to earn one day of sick time. Regular 8 hour workers have to work 3 months. I have never had disciplinary action for attendance in my 10 years with the company until they updated the policy. They claim the change was to help us, but it's quite obvious it was to make it harder to call out. God forbid you catch the flu and need more than a day of recovery. With record profits for the company, our executives are seeing huge pay increases, yet the lower level employees are technically making less than we used to with the rising costs of living. The technology issues are worse than ever.

Best Company I've Worked For!,5.0,"Sep 8, 2023","Extra Space has been the best company I've worked for in my career. I've been here for almost 3 years now and during that time I've seen how much the company cares for it's employees. They are constantly looking for ways to improve the work life balance of employees and do the right things for the employees. I have seen it in all parts of the company (field, corporate, and call center). When I first started I kept waiting for ""the other shoe to drop"". A lot of companies say they are great during the recruiting process, but after you get in the door the shiny and new wears off and you find out it's not great. 3 years later I still find that this company is true to their words.","The environment is very fast paced so sometimes it can be very busy.

Hiring Commission Pay is Deceiving,2.0,"Feb 10, 2024",Respectful. Intensive training & support. A lot of opportunities to win small gift cards for your effort. Supply all equipment needed to work from home. Friendly team members. Positive work culture and work/life balance.,"Quarterly schedule lottery, random positioning in schedule bid is not very random, best positions for highest earners who have been with company the longest, making it difficult for new hires of less than three years to get shifts which pay commissions well. When getting a less-desired, bad schedule, there is little to almost no chance of earning a commission. Commission structure is misleading and too rigid, high service calls to the sales call side ruin the numbers your percentages are structured around, even if your actual sales numbers are high, making it nearly impossible to commission in amounts that are beneficial. Will terminate you if your sales percentage numbers are bad/too low for 3 rolling months (which if you get a bad shift in the bid is the entire quarter) even if your legit sales call percentage are super high, the service calls coming in on the sales side can destroy your overall percentage rate. Passive/aggressive performance reviews where the management acts like the focus is to help and support teams but really is to threaten your position if in the quarter you can not meet their goals. Actually very low paying position, because you are hired with the promise of high commission opportunities to offset hourly pay. Continuously firing team members as well as a high turnover rate from team members leaving due to actual commissions, leaving call center under staffed, which additionally burdens team members with call volume as they take more service calls which throw off the sales numbers. Company continuously tells you the numbers “even out in the end” which is a flat out lie.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

They can cuss you out and assault you, but the minute they escalate to a DTL or DM, they get what they want and you’re left to pick up the pieces.

"Assistant TO the Manager, Be Warned!",1.0,"Jan 1, 2024","Work life balance. Sundays are guaranteed off, holiday pay and consistent with your chosen weekday off.","Be warned! If you become an Assistant Manager here, I have a few lessons for you I had to learn the hard way. These warnings are specifically for the Morganton/Hickory NC area although the company as a whole has a high turnover! 1. Make sure to ask to meet the staff that you’ll actually be working with, it’ll make all the difference on your first impression of what the workplace culture will actually be like! I only interviewed with the district manager and trainer. Once I met the actual staff I had to work with, the entire mood changed! I experienced a lot of racial micro-aggressions, unprofessionalism, hypocrisy and laziness from my Store Managers and one of my trainers. 2. Although you have the title “Assistant Manager”, it is just you and a Store Manager in the store. I was led on to believe I was in a leadership position working alongside a Store Manager over staff, but that is not the case! So make sure you’re working with a great store manager with actual professional management skills, otherwise you might end up being treated like the Store Manager’s personal assistant doing the dirty work and their scapegoat when something goes wrong like I was. 3. This particular district, if they don’t like you, for whatever reason, they will attempt to manage you out. Which means making your job more difficult and having you document your progress as a legal justification for terminating you. Luckily I’m a hard and professional worker because this little trick of theirs did not work. I ended up being with the company for almost a year before I finally found something else and quit! 4. The company looks and sounds professional on paper, but on the actual district and store level, they are not! They are not preparing the Store Managers (who you will be working under) for actual leadership positions. A huge evidence of this is that the managers don’t even train you, you’ll have a trainer travel to you for that and leave once your training is over. Unless you get lucky and you work in the same store as your trainer. This creates an environment of entitled Store Managers who are protected by favoritism and having longevity with the company. There’s only “slap on the wrists” if they do wrong in this particular district. 5. Know your worth. If you’re interviewing and you know the pay is low and they try to entice you with annual or performance based pay raises, don’t settle! I was “meeting expectations” at the end of the year and I received a thirty cent raise. Even “exceeding expectations” will be less than a $1 raise. 6. This is a dirty, outside and at times dangerous and sketchy job. They don’t disclose or elaborate on this too much during the interview process, so allow me to. Don’t let the temperature controlled office setting fool you. Especially if you’re the Assistant Manager. You’ll spend majority of days outside cleaning out every storage unit on these gigantic properties the second someone moves in or out, rain or nighttime, which can be full of pests. Homeless people sleeping on the property or inside the units is a huge thing, which can be a dangerous, dirty or awkward situation to run into. Creepy/sketchy things do happen. There are most days where you’ll cover the store alone, so keep that in mind. This particular district, I was consistently working by myself not even a full week out of my training when I was told it would be at least a month before that happened. You are this company’s pest control, landscaper, handyman and plumber because they’ll do anything to save a quick buck. If you like your personal space, too bad, because you are required to drive customers in the front seat beside you in a golf cart to their storage unit. You also have to do bill collecting calls for customers who haven’t paid their bills, so be prepared for some seriously angry customers because they can’t get in their units or their items are being auctioned off! But again if you have a great Store Manager that views you as an equal, then you won’t have to worry about all the dirty work being put on just you. 7. As an Assistant Manager, know that majority of your days will be spent covering other stores. I was told maybe a day or two I will be covering my neighboring stores, which are each thirty minutes away from my home store. In reality I spent three out of 5 days every week at these other stores and I had no control over my schedule or where I would be. You’re basically a pawn piece for these managers, you go where they want you to with little concern for how you feel about it.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Turn over is extremely high. At best this is a place to get some pay and insurance until you find a real job that appreciates what each individual has to offer a workplace. Also if you work after store hours to help a customer they are too cheap to pay you and will expect you to take a longer lunch so that they don't have to pay you overtime.

They are less micro managing than some companies as long as you are completing your work, which is really nice, and do provide you with pretty much what you need to make the job doable, within reason.","Honestly, not too much is a con here. My current site is slower, so it's normally just myself which can be a con as it falls to me only to really handle all the tasks daily, but not a big issue.

"Great, but flaws exist",4.0,"Sep 21, 2023",Benefits are top notch and affordable in comparison to my past employers. I have a no deductible healthcare plan that has saved me so much this year. They offer generous reimbursement for a ton of different fitness related things and a credit you can earn easily to help with your monthly premium. They do their very best to provide all the resources you need to do your job well. If you utilize what is given you'll be in great shape. Support from management is usually top notch as well. Opening up remote roles in the national call center post COVID was a smart move. Working from home is amazing. Overall the culture is positive and the environment is good. I may have a lot in the cons section but they want feedback and I'm willing to provide.,"Mandatory PTO usage during FMLA is unfair. If you're sick you have to sacrifice time you've earned and possibly not have a much needed vacation during the year. Everyone should have those weeks of PTO for leisure and relaxation, not managing illness that prevents them from working. Communication is a constant problem. The systems in place don't work well. The disconnect between the call center and the field is staggering. The recent merger was fraught with issues and the call center was completely understaffed during the initial stages. Stress levels have been at an all time high. I feel it could have been handled a lot better. It's very irritating to see upper management saying it was handled well and not owning up to the mess it was. There's not enough emphasis on the service side of the call center. We're constantly taking way more volume overall and have less time between calls because we never have enough agents in comparison to sales. We take the brunt of customer complaints. Feels like we're the afterthought, not the priority. I dislike the ETO system immensely. It's never enough. After the crazy merger nonsense they should load some ETO in for everyone as a thank you since a lot of us had to use it to get some sanity back. While remote roles have expanded, most of the open positions at the main office are still not remote. I don't want to move to Utah, so I feel that my opportunities are limited until then. There also should be more roles within the call center that support agents and don't involve being on the phones.

Its... a publicly traded company,3.0,"Aug 5, 2023","In my experience, there has been no micromanagement and I LOVE that independence.

(Anyone too corporate will tell you that you work based on the companies needs). I like the half office/half outdoor role, having a reason to get up and stretch your legs feels great.

The benefits are honestly kind of trash and the company doesn't fully pay them. They help, but you'll still be footing a couple hundred a month, at least. Embarrassing for a S&P 500 company. You're a call center, a collections agent, a janitor, a front office desk worker, the escalation department, the maintenance guy, and so on. But your compensation will show otherwise. It begins to feel like a joke when you have to explain to a renter why their rates go up $50-$100 at a time with no extra services being provided to them while your wages are stagnant. The company is monopolizing the market, so their extremely high ""street rate"" is some arbitrary big wig algorithm created to make it look like its the markets fault. $5/sq ft of non climate controlled space?

Culture Matters - But for REAL!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2023","The ""pro's"" list of working for ESS is extensive, but here are my personal favorites. 1) There is constant development at every level, and room for growth. We are a ""by the people, for the people"" type of company which values our employees. Ever since I joined 6 years ago, I have been poured into, developed, presented opportunities and have been encouraged to be my best my numerous mentors who have helped me get to where I am today. I don't know when I would have made it into the corporate world if it weren't for mentors encouraging me to apply to positions I did not qualify for or putting their stamp of approval on me as a candidate because they saw my potential before I did. 2) Our Culture. It is simply one of a kind and is the reason behind our success. We don't just preach our culture, we live it. Every employee at every level. It's just who we are and what we do here. I have the freedom to be a fun, optimistic, realist and show my slightly competitive self with no shame. 3) Work Life Balance. Although I have a high drive and work more hours than needed, everyone at ESS is entitled to a work life balance. For our site employees, our offices are open within reasonable and regular business hours. For corporate, our expectation is that you follow suit. At the corporate level, our time is precious and best spent in the field, with our people, partnering with our stores to drive results. I work a salary position, and still have a life. Lastly, pro number 4) The experience gained is applicable to life and other business situations. I firmly believe that the attention to detail that we have here is what helps fine tune the brain of any businesswoman (or man) and entrepreneur. You have the opportunity to learn in depth business accumen while also getting paid to put your knowledge into practice in a safe space that allows you the opportunity to fine tune your own skills. We have development programs, e-learning, a GREAT L&D department, articles, seminars and mentorship programs that we use in order to help set anyone up for success. This is a very unique industry that has an interesting learning curve, however, there is not a day that goes by that you do not have the tools or mentors needed to succeed. There are no ""stupid"" questions. There is feedforward, not feedback. There is the safe space to learn and the grace to make mistakes. I do not get the Sunday scaries. I do not feel intimidated when my boss visits me. I do not fear what people think of me when I say ""I am not sure what to do here"" because I know that there is someone or something out there to help me. Like I said in the very beginning, there are A LOT of pro's for working here, but these are my top 4.","I honestly think the only ""con"" I can think of is around the compensation guides, at every level. Although we do have a bonus structure as well as stock options/compensation packages at different levels, this is an extremely lucrative business that continues to flourish. The scope of work at any level is not difficult, however, it is time consuming and often times tedious. If we are looking for people who genuinely live out our company values of Excellence and Innovation, I truly believe that comes at a greater cost that what we offer monetary wise. Now. I choose to stay here because the pro's I listed give me peace and fulfillment which is more than I can say for a LOT of corporate (especially salary) jobs out there. I truly am happy working here, even under stressful or challenging situations. I do also see that there is an area of opportunity that we should be able to remedy through an increased pay range. Money is not everything, but it definitely helps. It's times like these where you have to sit down and really think about what matters most to you. Do you want to work for a company that has a great culture, cares about you, offers work life balance and a peace of mind as well as an opportunity to grow and develop at the cost of getting paid less? Or. Do you want to work at a soul sucking corporate job that you hate because you get paid more, ultimately bumping you into a higher tax bracket and losing a large lump sum of that to taxes annually anyways? I choose option 1, but that is just me.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

No second chances,1.0,"Oct 5, 2023","Benefits, Sunday's off, that's about it.","Extra space took over Life Storage, and that's when everything changed. I was a former LS manager, I loved my job, I took pride in my property, I worked hard to keep up with the constant changes, and I took it well. Or so I thought. I was terminated, thanks to the divisional managers, ""no second chances"" policy for LS store managers, and LS managers only. I made a mistake, and I wasn't given a chance to explain myself. They decided the best course of action was to fire me. It's funny how rumors can be spread and talked about, trickling down from your closest members and then going straight down to new hires. I'm not gonna let others get fired, so y'all can try to contact me and try to ""investigate,"" and try to fire everyone just to feel good about yourselves, but at the end of the day, I guess that's all you need. They don't care about you. You're a number. That's all they care about now. They made that ABUNDANTLY CLEAR when they took over LS, they treated us like we didn't know how to work storage, as if many of us hadn't worked storage for several years +. We had low turnover rates, which is the opposite of what I found out was the opposite for ES. They had shown us employees that had worked there for several years, but little did I know, there were several employees, under 2 years employed by ES. DM's will throw you straight under the bus and will run you over a couple of times for good measure. It was extra funny that they treated us LS employee's like we were ignorant or something. As if we weren't doing the same job, with possibly more trust and freedom. To employee's and those looking to be employed, ask your DM at least five times before doing something, because then they'll fire you if you do it. Don't fall for these 5* reviews, they send out a link here and there for employee's to fill out a glassdoor review. Don't think you're secure in your job, they'll replace you within 2 weeks or less 🤣 Don't stress yourself out for a job where you're a number unless you're a district manager and up.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

9 Year Review,3.0,"Jun 10, 2023","Pros: Live On Site, Job Security Biggest perk was living on site, and job security. Extra Space was very good to their employees during Covid which I am forever grateful for and they are a very forgiving and understanding company.","After working for ESS for 9+ years(2014-2023), I have a lot to say. A lot of ups and a lot of downs, definitely a wild ride. I think if I can summarize my experience with ESS with one word, I would say STRESSFUL. I remember getting hired and my DM telling me “here at Extra Space we wear many hats”, and now I know if you hear that, get ready to be overworked and underpaid. You will indeed wear many hats. Some days I felt like a psychologist, therapist, exterminator, janitor, HVAC technician, handyman, manager, slave, father, prison warden, the list goes on and on. Stressful is an understatement. Aside from literally having to play many roles, there are really two factors that determine your experience here. One, location, and two, staff. I had the worse of both. One, I worked at an urban location where delinquency was high(meaning a lot of late customers, people peeing/pooping in the building, rude/nasty/entitled customers who would threaten you, yell at you to your face) And two, I worked with many, and I mean many employees who were lazy and did the bare minimum. One thing with ESS is team work truly makes the dream work. Each property is mainly staffed 2-3 people, so the real issue is the employees. Customers will be customers, there’s always a way to deal with people if you do so with respect and dignity. The problem is when you work with people who are not self starters, lazy, take advantage, and want to get paid without doing work, THATS when the job can take you through some of the worse seasons. Extra Space is interesting because it combines both physical and mental. On one hand there’s the physical side of the job where you have to clean storage units, maintain landscaping by picking up trash, cleaning stairwells, changing light bulbs, cleaning elevator tracks, mopping, you literally do it all. Then, there’s the mental side where you have to assist customers, manage auctions, sell units, make rental/delinquent phone calls. Now again, it’s all apart of the territory. And for the most part as overwhelming as that may sound, it actually isn’t too bad IF you have a team. This is where your experience drastically changes because if you work with someone who for example has anger issues, is overweight and lazy, someone who perhaps cannot take criticism well, someone who sees a customer park and runs to the bathroom to “dodge” a customer, it becomes hell. This is when you can feel the weight pill on because if you are someone who cares about your job, passionate, self starter, but work with others who aren’t, you will be abused to high heaven , and this job turned me into a horrible human being. I loved people and took pride in my job in the early years, but as time progressed and I worked with people who were in fact lazy, took advantage and did the bare minimum, it made me a bitter person, a person who no longer cared about others, a more reserved and quiet person. This job truly took a toll on me for the worse. What kept me going honestly was the live on site because of course I wasn’t paying rent so it was a huge blessing, especially since I am a single father, however, it cost me my peace, my sanity, my mental, I’m no longer the person I used to be. I know this may sound dramatic, but I am a person who does care and I always do any job with passion and care. It sucks when you wish you can “turn off the care” but can’t. And when you work with others who don’t care, this job can feel like torture. Anyone considering working for ESS, I would still recommend to the company, but again, location and staff will HIGHLY impact your experience here.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Great company with awesome management!,5.0,"Oct 2, 2018","When I was first presented with the opportunity to interview at Extra Space Storage, I thought storage sounded so boring (I was currently working at a huge online retailer).. but I researched the company and heard nothing but good things, and am so glad I took the job here almost two years ago! Even though storage isn't the most thrilling product, what I love about ESS is that they are always trying to keep their employees excited and involved, and are constantly growing and changing to keep up with technology and trends. They completely renovated the office space so it's very modern and open, there is free coffee, soda, and fruit, monthly office socials, food truck parties just to show the employees their appreciation, holiday parties, summer parties, and more! The benefits are fantastic - great medical, dental, vision, PTO, incentives to stay healthy and fit, 401K, and more.. The executive team is by far the best I've ever worked with- there are no egos (rare nowadays!), they value their employees' opinions, they remain transparent with everything going on with the company, and take the time to get to know each employee. Joe (the CEO) is by far the nicest CEO I've ever worked with as well. There's a reason why we've become one of the best places to work!","I would say the training has lacked a little bit, but we just barely rolled out a new training program so that took care of it!","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Great place to work,5.0,"May 5, 2023","I really love working with customers but at a place that really wants me to grow and excel, as opposed to a large retailer/department store. I manage my own property and have a lot of control of what my day to day looks like. Like with all customer service jobs there are always going to be a few difficult customer situations, but for the most part I have great relationships with my regulars and I enjoy going to work everyday. I also really like being able to split my day between outside and indoor tasks. My property has an excellent view and it's nice to be able to walk or take the golf cart out and do some cleaning if you want to stretch your legs and get some fresh air. Also, when you do eventually work your way to being a store manager, most properties come with an apartment where you live on site, and the apartments are actually really nice with new appliances (dishwasher, washer/dryer, full kitchen and stove, full bathroom, etc). Most are two bedrooms one bath, and some even have a balcony or patio. I also really love getting off by 6pm every night (and 5:30pm on Saturdays) and always having Sundays off. That has been game changing and now that I have it I'm not sure I would take a job with sporadic hours. Everyone is really nice here, and like I said earlier the higher ups DO want you to get the most out of your experience and this is a company that definitely promotes from within to see their staff grow. I personally love working here and don't see myself changing companies anytime soon. If I want to grow beyond my store manager position there are many opportunities for me to do so, but I really like running my store and making it the best it can be.","Unfortunately, there are a few downsides that come with all customer service jobs and a few specific to storage. People will come in upset with either their rate going up, or something with their unit they need fixed, or even worse there could have been a break-in or rodents in their unit. These are not every day conversations but they are tough when you get them. It is also hard sending people to auction when they haven't paid in a long time, but ExtraSpace is VERY flexible and I'm glad I am able to offer people the chance to come get their items at a higher reduced price if they can no longer afford the payments.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

High expectations and but rarely scheduled with additional help. As stated before you are often working alone. while this can be great. company has high expectations many of which Can be close to imposible to maintain on a regularly when things get busy with out at lease one more person. no room for free thinking: Many complaints seem to be brushed over and waived or explained away as being excuses .

The Perfect Blend of a Physical job and an Office Job,5.0,"Apr 18, 2023","1.) I get to work outside doing physical work, but I can schedule my day as needed, so that if its too hot or too cold at some point in the day I can choose to do my office work during that time. 2.) If I feel like I've spent too much time making calls and answering emails I can go outside to clean a unit, Help customers on site or do any of the many other things that constantly need to get done. 3.) Lots of Career opportunities. If you want a company to grow with Extra Space is the place to be. I started working with Extra Space as an Assistant Manager and with in 5 months I worked my way to Site Manager and have had very open conversations about how to progress from here in order to keep growing with the company. 4.) Awesome company culture. Extra Space really cares about the people they hire and they work hard to make sure that they continue to hire people who care. The company values are listed as Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Teamwork, and Passion. And the company truly works to live those values everyday. 5.)The hours. There is a definite respect for work life balance. No schedule is perfect, but I love that we always get Sunday off, and that if I am responsible about staying in communication about my needs my supervisor is willing to be reasonably flexible. 6.) The people are the best of the best. Extra Space holds it self accountable to its high standard based off of its company values and it works hard at finding and hiring people who feel passionate about living a life based on values, and I am grateful for that because everyone I have had the pleasure of working with so far has not only been a great team mate, but also a great person.","Like any job there are cons, but I definitely feel that for me the pros outweigh the cons. That may not be the case for everyone, so I think its important to answer some of the questions that may have come up from seeing the other reviews from other employees. 1.) Have I had to pick up Human Feces? Yes. Was I happy about it? Absolutely Not! Do I blame the company? No. In both situations where customers choose to be this disrespectful and disgusting I had a civilized discussions with said customers and they received repercussions for their actions. 2.) Am I mostly working alone? Yes. As a Site Manager I am normally the only one at my site, which depending on the day can be a pro or a con. On busy days it can feel like a lot, but for the most part I have created a work flow that allows me to get things done in a timely manner. But it can get a little lonely on slow days. 3.) Am I required to help other stores? Yes. As mentioned before, managers are normally at their site by themselves, if a site is more busy than another the busy site will reach out for help with their calls, so they can get some of their physical work done in a timely manager. To be this isn't a burden its a way to build trust and relationships with other managers in my district. But if teamwork isn't your thing keep that in mind. 4.) Are we asked to request reviews from customers? Yes. Currently we are asked to get at least 10 reviews a month. They are easy to send and easy for the customer to fill out. It literally can be as quick as 4 taps on their phone. From opening the link to choosing how many stars to give their experience. I normally get at least 15 to 20 reviews a month.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Do not work here!!,1.0,"May 31, 2023",Very hard to get fired and gives you lots of chances to fail before they pull the plug. Gives you an allowance for shirts and shoes every year. Yearly percentage bonus based off performance but very skewed so a 50/50.,"This would be a no star if i could make it that but I can’t. Toxic work environment. Corporate doesn’t care about field level employees at all. You will work way more than you have too especially if you live on site. They don’t pay very well, corporate keeps all the money even though they don’t do anything except send emails out. For the pay, which is not good at all, you’re required to run a million dollar business every year and know everything about it. If you start to hit your bonus goal they cap you off and lower the payout, when it should be the other way around. You have a ton of metrics to hit for sales and for your store and they’re almost impossible to hit altogether. Corporate really has no idea how to run the sales process but yet require the field employees to know it better than your children. Corporate has zero respect for field level employees. They expect you to deal with rate increases and upset customers when you had nothing to do with it in the first place and then it’s the field level employees fault for not keeping them as a customer or if they leave a bad review when again we had nothing to do with the issue. Company doesn’t value its employees and doesn’t care about screwing people over, the most unethical company you will come across, they don’t care about customers and employees. If Extra Space can screw over a customer and find a loop hole then bet your butt they will find a way. You also only get 3 paid days off throughout the year. Banks are off employees should be off Also don’t expect to move up unless you want to work here for no pay for 15-20 years and maybeeee and I mean maybeeee have a shot to get an interview but the average response is that you don’t have enough experience and then they hire a 21 year old fresh out of college with no experience and no clue how to do anything. 15-17 bucks an hour isn’t worth the stress and headache that this job will put you through. Better be ready to have those knee pads ready if you want to get anywhere in this company, if you catch my drift. Also benefits package is outrageous for a field employee. If you opt into it as a field level employee, it will be roughly 1/3 your pay or more and that’s if your single, have a family then cut your paycheck in half and some.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Hard to have motivation when bad work ethic and rule breaking goes unpunished while hard work and dedication goes unrewarded. It's strange to stay but becoming a store manager is a con there's not a great enough pay bump to make up for the travel you had as an assistant manager. And that's just off what I've been told. A personal con to the job as an assistant manager is going weeks without working with someone. Having to cover down on the busiest sites in our district alone on a Monday morning to start a week is not fun.

(9:30 am - 6:00 pm M-F & 9:00 am - 5:30 pm on Sat.) My District Manager tries to work with personal schedules for days off within reason, but the business needs must come before personal preferences.

Great however,3.0,"Mar 3, 2023",The company as a whole puts a lot of effort into making sure employees feel cared for. Being a publicly traded company they do routine evaluations of cost of living and adjust pay according to their perspective per region. Current District manager is new and has been super busy but she's been amazing to work with. I feel like things are finally getting done. I feel like she's listening and that she and I align on a lot of goals. She's the reason I'm still here. Now I feel like I have the resources and support I need to continue making progress with this store.,"There are people at the district level that clearly don't care. I had a sit-in DM try to tell me that all the problems I asked her for help with; the problems that my store has had for years before I got here, are all my fault because of ""time management."" I had another district level manager imply that I get paid too much and she reiterated about ""time management."" I am glad to work on time management but that wasn't what any of this was about. I was being blamed for things that existed before I got here and then not get recognized for the leaps and bounds of improvements this store has experienced since I got here. That is a horribly unhealthy way for leadership to behave. People don't quit bad jobs, they quit bad managers. Unrelated but it is worth noting that I do not get paid enough for the cost of living for this area, let alone for the work I do. My rent is $1800/mnth. My paychecks come out to $2600/mnth after taxes and insurance. It's not sustainable. I intend to be a father one day and I don't even get paid enough to save for a house. I have now gotten sick from mold/mildew in a unit, I've had to come in on my days off because people keep breaking the doors, and I've had to clean up fecal matter. None of that is the company's fault but just know what you're getting into if you want to work here.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

The company has made amazing strides over the past several years to stay ahead of the curve and remain current with the changes in times and technology. With that being said the work flow has also changed and expanded beyond the original basic facility maintenance and minor administrative work by offering us a more hands on approach to running our stores.

A talent drain with field employees has been extensive across the board with few high performers, causing the company to charge far more than the market value of units and goods to make up for the talent drain of their field employees. The only reason it's top 90 of 100 companies in the US on Glassdoor, is that it asks its employees to review the company positively in exchange for gift card chances. I would not recommend this job to friends or family members as they over manage their expectations of employees and pay below the industry average. For an example if your slightly overweight, you will be looked down upon and be told that you need to meet the company image. You can take your complaint to HR but they will do nothing if you have nothing in writing. If you get too old, in a corporate position, they try to push you out even if you perform to a high standard, which is around 50. They'll hire district managers that cause multi million dollar class action lawsuits and fire an entire district worth of employees without just cause but keep them in line to be senior district managers. Any other workplace would remove these people but Extra Space Storage embraces them.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Now I'm a bussiness major so I understand the need for a company to increase it's revenues and profits but Extra Space goes to far as they try to nickle and dime their customers at every turn. Extra Space pushes its employees to use bait and switch tactics when renting storage units to customers. They force customers to buy storage insurance . As one customer told me sounds like ObamaCare ( where the federal government mandates that everyone buys health insurance). Extra Space also loves to jack up tenants rates . Now I understand rate increases are necessary but their increases are ridiculously high and of course it's the store employees who catch the crap from angry tenants. The computer system that Extra Space uses is outdated slow and prone to many errors which can make life hell for store employees. Technical support from The ""Help"" Desk is slow and useless. In a nutshell Extra Space is extremely greedy and at times unethical.

The staff that we hire for handyman work is always the lowest bid and 9 times out of 10 the work is mediocre at best. Not enough employees in our area but we just recently hired two new employees so hopefully it will get better. The Store Managers should get paid higher wages considering all of the physical work that is weighed on our shoulders. I cant even get someone to pick up large items by my dumpster so I end up doing it myself taking it to the dump, saving the company money and keeping my property looking nice. I'm not getting paid bulk item removal fee to do so. It's a lot of work and we just aren't recognized for being the brain and body of each store. Maybe if the DM's or higher up employees actually were Store managers they would understand better as to what all we go through on a daily basis.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

There are a lot of really smart people which always creates a wonderful environment for learning from others and producing quality work. Pay is very competitive and from what I have seen, they definitely promote from within when they can. Company cares about your feedback. We recently had a town-hall meeting in which we voices all types of concerns to the CEO and the rest of the executive team. They also send surveys to rate people you work with, including your boss. They have a great fit reimbursement program where they reimburse you 50% of gym fees/fitness equipment etc up to $500 (they will reimburse $250 each year). The company is booming and probably will for a very long time. It's a very technologically savvy company and that makes things run so much better than if you were to work somewhere where they were behind on technology. Chief executive team is wonderful. They are definitely approachable. Overall, I cannot complain. It's a great corporate job with amazing pay.

Presently, I report to an excellent district manager. He is results-driven, supportive and always available to discuss my present and future career goals. What is really impressive is that I have been a management/professional for over twenty years and I still learn new things from him. Our district manager takes the time to visit us one on one and discuss our property and ways to make our business better. He is always teaching us new aspects of business so the job never gets stale. You only have to drive by the properties or look at the site reviews to see he oversees a staff that cares about our customers and their overall satisfaction. He also promotes within and fosters a great relationship among his managers. I also was managed by his assistant for two years. She too is class act and always there if we need her. All and all I give my employer and management team five stars. But seeing is believing.

Extra Space,4.0,"Apr 29, 2016",Good benefits and good bonus / commission structure. This company is the highest pay in the industry. Extra Space advancement opportunities are available as well as transfers to any facility in this Nat'l Corp.,"Don't be fooled. This is not an office job. If you walked into a facility and thought the Mgr you spoke with had it made, and left thinking this is just an easy office job, think again. Doesn't matter your gender or age, be prepared to be responsible for most any maintenance issue. Extra Space is considered the cleanest in the industry. To accomplish that you will be scrubbing walls, doors and floors then wiping it all down with rags to achieve a dust and dirt free unit, which may be inspected by you DM. I tell you this because no one told me this when I hired on, and no one mentioned there is no maintenance personnel hired for the properties. This can be a problem for some in the freezing cold or the stifling heat. You will be gritty dirty on a regular basis, and still be responsible for greeting customers and running your office. And thats just the units....the entire property needs cleaning daily, as well as CC halls need mopped regularly, and roll up garage doors are hand washed as well to be free of dust.

Backsliding Company,2.0,"Jun 30, 2016",It truly is hard to find something to rave about. However it was not always this way.,"We have so much paperwork it is ridiculous. We have so many reports to roll up on a weekly and monthly basis. The content of these reports are things we normally should be doing or business numbers of which we should already be aware. Instead of the District Managers addressing lack in the areas ofthose reports with individual personnel, the middle managers have chose to inflict discipline on their entire group rather than those who are the offenders. This tendency has evolved into the overall style of management. Another thing I despise is the company Facility Operations Manual specifically says the customer has two options for insurance on their stored goods. Either Extra Space insurance (CPP) or their own (home owners/renters). The Ops Manual also says never lose a rental over insurance. However many employees have been disciplined and even terminated for not getting CPP insurance on over 94% of their rentals.

Terrible company to work for.,1.0,"Jun 18, 2014","If you like working alone and making money for this greedy company that won't return some of those vast profits down to the people making them, then this is the place for you.","Worked 2 years as an assistant manager and was told upon first being hired that I would move between 2 sites to assist the managers of those 2 sites. That was not the case of course. Within a few weeks I was working 4 different sites a week traveling all across our district and not being reimbursed for my mileage since the DM/DLS never informed me how the reimbursement worked. Upon discovering this month's later I was told I was SOL on those past months... For some reason I stayed any way and continued to be thrown around the district, working 4 different sites a week. Never getting weekends off and never having the same day off. They then expect you to basically harass your customers to no end with phone calls of some 'new' procedure that they will scrap in a few weeks. The corporate HQ is an embarrassment as they treat their employees like numbers because that is what ESS cares about most. I have never seen a company care so little about keeping their employees happy, but they sure do like to come down on you if one of your hundred different metrics is in the red. The straw that broke the camels back was that I was requesting bereavement and was told that if I could not find someone to cover I would be denied bereavement, I didn't even know they could do that but I guess they can.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

We are required to walk strangers through a warehouse to show units. They know we are alone and that is unsettling. Some warehouses are located off the beaten path and in questionable neighborhoods. Anything can happen with no witnesses and no help. We are expected to be there for the customers, answer calls within a certain time, follow up reservations within 15 minutes and leave the facility to go to the bank. With one person on site this is just not possible. The phone goes unanswered and customers wait for you to return. It's common for us to be yelled at by angry customers complaining about late fees and auctions or having to wait outside a locked office for you to return.

I have sent ideas in the past suggesting a higher per hour with the current bonus set up would be beneficial, bust those properties with low inventory and/or high prices can only rent a fraction of what other stores can generate ( even in the same district) Especially with the fast approaching consensus on $15.00 per hour, employees would have options outside of Extra Space that are not currently viable.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

It's a team environment and you can always reach out to others for assistance.","The biggest problem I have seen since I started working here is the constant turn over of employees.

He genuinely cares and wants you to grow and succeed. The schedule is pretty sweet as well: 9:30am-6pm and closed on Sundays. This is a heavily customer oriented job. You'll deal with a huge variety of people every day. Some are great, but you'll also experience some not so great ones. Just something to keep in mind. Overall I have enjoyed my time here. The culture is inclusive and supportive.","The pay is pretty bad considering what we do. As a SM, you are responsible for EVERYTHING on the property. Maintenance and upkeep, billing from vendors, foreclosures, etc. Often there is only one person on site, so it gets overwhelming at times. Also be prepared to have people very angry with you and scream a lot. I've had many screw this moments as customers take everything that is wrong in their lives out on you. Have a thick skin! Another thing I really REALLY despise is the fact that we are expected to get at least 10 Google reviews a month. If you don't, be prepared to get called out on it on a Teams meeting. The Google metric is the worst.

"Annoying sales techniques, over indulging the company, too many secret shoppers.",1.0,"Apr 11, 2010","Decent pay, benefits, steady job","ESU is ridiculous, hard to do when there's work to be done. The SIZZLE customer service is ridiculous. Good customer service is important, but they take it to the point where it's not genuine, but a script. If you need that much to make a sale, then your product isn't that great. You HAVE to talk about how great the company is, how awesome you are, how awesome the site is, etc etc etc. Then to top it off, when a customer doesnt want to make the committment, you have to call them back 5-7 different times as ""follow ups"" What makes this worse, is some of these people are secret shoppers and have no intention of buying. Calls are also recorded then reviewed and shared among your peers in the district. They also grade you on your performance. The SIZZLE stuff is really unnecessary, the product speaks for itself and if your customer service is top notch (without excessive script reading) you can make the sale! The ESS product is by far top notch, but you don't need to over indulge in it to make the sale. One more thing, I sure don't like to be called 5+ times by someone trying to get my business or a sale if I'm not that interested at all, so I sure don't like having to call them so many times to get their business.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

I found out today that multiple store managers who possibly will be, is or won’t be a DTL and is getting paid under $18. With 4 or 5 years of experience with the same company. That is sad. They say they promote within. Haven’t seen that yet. Certain districts can be dry and stale (filled with old people who will take the next step and stay where they’re for years. So people below especially young people don’t want to stay bc of that reason.) Amount of responsibilities you have isn’t that hard but doesn’t come close to what you should be getting paid. Amount of maintenance you do yourself incredible high. You do everything but heavy duty stuff like cleaning units throughly, changing light bulbs, sweeping hallways, sending invoices, reaching sales, KPI numbers and much more.

The work load isn’t a lot as all you have to do is rent units to customers and make sure they get insurance. The DTL’s (district team leads) are there to help whenever you need it and are super supportive!!

The only thing that can be annoying is the secret shoppers whether it’s over the phone or in person you have to be by the books, they grade you on it and everything. Other than that it’s a great way to see how you are with real customers. My only bad experience was after leaving, i didn’t get the support from remote recruitment that i expected when relocating.

It is a job..,2.0,"Jul 29, 2017",Great co-workers and a lot of down time to catch up on the news. Also when it is slow I have time to apply for a new job and conduct phone interviews.,"Most of the time working alone and managers get all the credit for everything. Pay could be a lot better as well. I have been working here for 3 years and new hires in the same position as I get paid more than me and I have a Bachelors Degree in Business. I applied for a District Manager in Training position and I met all the qualifications in the job description but was told I have to become a manager, and training manger first. The person who ended up getting the position never worked in the storage industry before getting hired. How do they expect us to stay motivated and try to get promoted when it would take another 5 years to move up with crappy pay. You are required to do Sales, Collections, Maintenance, and clean units while trying to reach some of the ridiculous goals the company wants to you hit. They also expect employees to get Google reviews from every customer that comes into the office. If you do not reach your Google Review goal you receive and nasty-gram email from your DM. Also having split days off lowers the moral of your employees.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

You will have to sell insurance to folks on every rental you do and try to get them to leave Google Reviews in the office. If this is not your thing, I'd look elsewhere. Depending on where you work, you could have to move to another store and possibly move apartments if you live on-site. You really don't have a say in the matter either. Like most corporate places, you could do really well at this job and never really get anything out of it. People have been passed over for promotions many times regardless of how good their sales numbers are or their customer service skills.

In two years I have found all of those to be true and much more. Extra Space Storage has always delivered on their promises. This is a soulful, caring and merit based company. Training is thorough and extends far beyond your first day. There is no disconnect between our Corporate Office ""Store Support Center"" and staff in the field. Few companies acknowledge, support and develop those in the field who are responsible for the success of the company as a whole in the way that ESS does. Many who work here claim to never have thought they would work in self storage. Now they cannot see working anywhere else. I count myself among them.","Having worked for a number of corporate retailers in the past, I have no reasonable complaint against Extra Space Storage. This is simply an exceptional place to work.

Super Supportive Management,5.0,"Nov 9, 2021","First of all, the benefits are honestly very comparable to most large companies and the monthly incentives are competitive, keeping things friendly and fun. Also, most sites close at 6pm (Mon-Fri) but you actually leave at 6pm, not 6:15 or 6:30. If you manage your day well, you literally clock out at 6pm. Most of the sites are also closed on Sundays so that is a benefit in itself. The Orlando District Manager is organized and well-versed in the storage industry so his communication is straightforward, helpful, and transparent. The Divisional Vice President is very involved, passionate, and also very ""hands on"". So far, this management team has contributed to me feeling valued and appreciated every step of the way. If you are a self-starter and self sufficient, you will appreciate working for Extra Space Storage. The training program was very thorough and set at a reasonable pace. My trainer not only welcomed my questions, he answered them with expertise. With most companies, the new hire gets ""lost"" in the shuffle after a few weeks, but with Extra Space, the training program sets you up for success, with the trainer and DM reaching out often to gauge your progress and be helpful in any way.

I truly, truly, feel valued as an employee working with Extra Space Storage. From my direct leadership team, up to the DVP and higher. Last year, the company did GREAT, and you know what they did? They gave every single employee a 5% raise. That is HUGE! I've never worked for a company that gave that out to the employees!

Disappointing Leadership,1.0,"Aug 16, 2016",My district team and peers in the division are great to work with.,"One of the Senior VPs is absolutely horrible to work with. He has no filter, talks poorly about other DIvisional VPs, senior executives and DIstrict Mgrs in the presence of anyone who will listen. As a DM, you have to travel with him and he does his best to criticize, put you and the DVP down and make himself sound important b/c of his title and tenure. My DVP hates to see him coming and so do DMs. We all have to receive sort of a pep talk before and after he leaves b/c my DVP knows how ignorant, rude and arrogant he is and tries to make the DMs feel better. He takes pleasure in bullying and making you feel uncomfortable during visits. Not to mention, he uses very foul language regardless of who he is around. I am embarrassed that he even works at Extra Space. For those applying for a DM position anywhere on the east coast, you should think twice about it. Every person on his support staff has left the company. Having to deal with him has been the worst part about this job and has caused me to seek employment elsewhere even though I'm considered high potential.

We see what other companies are doing all the time to attract new and young talent and there's nothing like that. What I mean are things like ping-pong tables, game systems, etc. It might seem like a waste of time but I think it's good to be able to do something to take a break and take your mind off of work for a few minutes a day. The landscape for hiring is progressively getting more competitive and with that comes employee retention. More rewards to employees staying long term as well as opportunities for pay increases instead of the only way being a promotion/title change to receive a pay increase would be nice.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Equates to VERY little PTO, unless you never get sick or work sick. Corporate checks (such as secret shoppers) are not made known during training. The standard that the secret shopper is seeking is not made known. So, the employee could be great, but miss the bullet points and look incompetent on a report that goes to corporate.

It isn't true that you can't take Saturday/Fridays off without PTO. That depends entirely on your DM and is not a blanket statement for the entire company. And getting one weekend day off every week is standard for many companies.

They also do something called where every couple years the senior leadership comes and shares a meal with all the employees, district by district, and then you have round table discussions with all of them.

I also like that we are closed on Sunday.","We used to be able to take 2 days off in a row ( Sunday, Monday) ( Saturday,Sunday) without having to use vacation time but now the days are split up. I think we should be allowed to do this at least once a month without using PTO. Also I believe that every site should have 2 employees and not have to share an assistant between stores.

"Stable and secure, but long term vision is shortsighted",3.0,"Jun 30, 2015","Extra Space is a stable company that was in the right place at the right time during the recession and has an economic rent in the short to medium term within the industry. That is, the company bought assets in limited supply at a favorable price and doesn't have to work that hard to do reasonably well. This makes for a fairly stable place to work where long hours are not generally the norm, but compensation generally matches this. There are certainly exceptions where compensation and payrates are more competitive.","The company talks a big game on innovation, but is afraid to really commit and take financial risk on innovative ideas that will be revenue drivers 10 or 20 years out. Even shorter term operational projects end up being a bit hamstrung by resource constraints resulting in sub-optimal results.

The company expected good work, but they also supported their people and did things the right way. That has mostly ended.","As I mentioned, Extra Space has changed a lot as a workplace. They seem to be pushing sheer quantity of work in many departments. Metrics are all that matter, and they're usually metrics that track rate of work--not impact. I don't know if they're trying to imitate Amazon, but that is the kind of change they are making across the board--industrializing every facet of work so they can squeeze all the value they can out of their people. What they're losing in that is the passion and ownership that made their workforce great. Extra Space was a top performing company for years, but they seem to be slipping, and I think employees are beginning to look elsewhere. I see Extra Space having significant retention, engagement, and performance issues down the road. Communication between management and employees is really poor. They're changing a number of departments without explaining anything to people. ""Anything"" may sound like hyperbole. It's not. Extra Space used to have a wonderful feeling. People were part of a team and did good things together. It was great. Now it feels like an assembly line, where the quota is all that matters.

While I've only been here for a little over a year, there are many employees who have been with the company for over a decade and you can definitely see why. They want to support you in whatever your goals may be. I've never worked in the storage industry before and the training provided is the best I've ever seen bar none.

I really like a lot of the people.,"The entire compensation package is mediocre at best. This may simply be the perspective of a software engineer in a company that refuses to accept the reality that they are a tech company more than a real estate company, but the fact remains. Jobs I held before this offered more pay, literally twice as much PTO, and better health benefits that costed less. This creates an interesting paradigm. On the one hand, the fact that any engineers stay here is a credit to what the company is doing right, because they CERTAINLY aren't staying for the compensation. The other side of the coin is, I wouldn't be surprised if the engineering department is one misstep away from losing about half their people. What would be most tragic, if it came to this, is some of the most skilled and experienced would be the first to leave because other opportunities would be much more lucrative.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

There is some disconnect in certain areas where the compensation seems higher that appropriate while other positions should be at a higher pay level. Recognition in all departments is not at the same level, so it can be sometimes difficult to feel you are making a difference.

I was told it was my job and was moved to that store as full time. Thanks for that. The upper management has zero idea on how to actually run a store.

These metrics have often been made the focus of meetings, site visits, and training sessions--too much emphasis on this can lead to perceptions that the company is entirely numbers focused.

In person and phone mystery shops are done regulalrly. There are scripts and guidelines you are required to use, even down to specific work usage. Google reviews are also extremely important and WILL be a major factor in your performance. While there are plenty of tools and coaching opportunities for these things, if you are uncomfortable in a sales/solicitation driven position, this will be challenging.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Opportunities and growth are a constant topic, putting the carrot on the stick for promotion opportunity. The fact of the matter is these opportunities are not equal. It's a game of favorites and politics. Even if you do get a promotion it's often only about $1 an hour with much more than $1 an hours' work slapped on. Very large difference in work depending on where the property is. A property in a nice area, you can get everything done in an hour or two. A ghetto property, you will find yourself always behind.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Keep in mind as you interview at corporate that every company will try to sell you on their culture and values just as you're trying to sell them on why you're great.

We really are the best at getting better.","For me the work/home life is not balanced the way that I would like in order to hav me an influence with my child the way I would like. The pay is also ridiculous, and a multi billion dollar company like ESS should really pay more and for the long term employees we are only now making what people just being hired are making which is again ridiculous.

What Happened?,3.0,"Dec 18, 2017","The pros at Extra Space are plenty. Decent benefits, Excellent training, Decent work/life balance, and decent vacation time. You'll be trained in a vast range of areas with skills that you can definitely take elsewhere such as sales, property management, or any retail management job. The training I received at ESMI was very thorough and when you were done with 'on paper' training you got to shadow a store for a couple weeks to put it all in to practice. Ideally you should be able to run a store with little supervision. Autonomy is good as well. If you do well and you have a decent district manager there should be no micro-management. Suggestions are taken seriously and even if it may take years to implement it rarely falls on deaf ears.","This is a personal con, and it may not translate over to everyone though the company, but middle management does have to step it up. District managers (in my experience) will often pick favorites and no matter how hard you work or how good your numbers are if you are not friends with your DM you're going to have a hard time. After working at ESMI for several years and being one of the top performers in my district I was looked over for promotion time and time again. Another thing that is universal company wide is the fact that you should plan on getting dirty. Often. Maintenance personnel are hard to come by so chances are you are going to have to do a LOT of cleaning, painting, and fixing yourself. For some that is not a bad thing, and at times it wasn't to me but it can get a little old. By the time I left I felt that Extra Space had gone from a small storage company to a huge corporation, making me feel like they had lost touch with what had made them great to begin with. The difficulty of the work is not that hard overall, however there is a lot that needs to be done and the pay certainly does not reflect that. Extra Space has some of the highest paid people in the storage industry but when compared to leasing agents at apartment complexes they make very little.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

You can tell they care about each employee.,With an accounting department of nearly 90 people they need to start offering other options for working besides just on a desktop. To be competitive they need to offer more flexibility. They should allow their employees to work flex schedules and give them laptops to work from home on some days. This will also solve their issue of running out of office space. Also the benefits are expensive compared to other places that I have worked.

Needs improvement,3.0,"Jun 9, 2016","I have been with the company since 2009. Compared to the other two storage companies that I have worked for, I will say that Extra Space has offered better pay and benefits (health insurance/401K) and I have a decent amount of paid time off that I can use throughout the year. We do not work on Sundays and have 4 major paid holidays off. I like the combination of office and ""outside"" responsibilities, you are not just sitting in a cubicle all day staring at a computer screen. For the most part you are on your own and have to be a self starter and good with managing your time. It's nice that ""the boss"" isn't standing over your shoulder and breathing down your neck every day. Most sites offer a ""free"" apartment for the store manager to reside in (that has it's own pros & cons in itself). Honestly, if it wasn't for the apartment I wouldn't even work here just because the pay by itself is too low for me to afford to pay rent elsewhere.","Because of Extra Space's high standards, they expect A LOT and that means A LOT of work. I have no problem with getting my hands dirty and doing minor maintenance and painting BUT when you mostly work alone...that is a huge problem. If you have what is considered a small property, you will be by yourself most of the time. This is very challenging when you are expected to take care of customers, do paperwork, answer the phone at all times, make bank runs, and maintain the property. I feel that only having one person allows things to be neglected and does not let my site reach its full potential. Also, some of the things that we are expected to do on the properties because the company wants to save money is ridiculous. For example, stripping and waxing floors and painting parking lot lines should be left to professionals. There is not to big of employee turn around at the site level but due to the constant redistricting of sites among other reasons, I have had quite a few different District Managers. Constantly having to get to know a new supervisor is exhausting. Our incentive program is a joke. If you have a great year and your property performance is great you will have little to no chance the following year making a bonus because of the unrealistic goals that they set for you. We keeping being told year after year that they are going to be restructuring the incentive program but I am certainly not holding my breath.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"Assistant Manager, Live On Site",2.0,"Apr 17, 2015","I was lucky to live and work on a beautifully maintained property for most of my time with ESS. The job is nice for people who like to step away from the desk and want a little physical activity during the workday. My apartment was large, in a great location, and nicely kept by the previous occupant who had lived in the place for around 10 years. This location and the nice apartment were really the selling points for the job. The customers at this location were really great and fun to assist. The ESS training program is a really integrative and very well organized.","The job is really little more than a glorified janitor and/or maintenance position, even though they slyly call it a ""Management"" position. Yes, you do have opportunities to practice sales skills with the customers, but this is a very small portion of your overall workload. Even at a well-maintained property like where I typically worked, the janitorial duties are at least 75% of your daily tasks. Forget about it, if you get a property that is not well-maintained. The company does not always promote from within, as they would have you believe at hire. The tipping point for me came with the opening of 2 new properties in my area. I saw veteran employees in our district get passed over for promotions by new hires who had zero experience in this field. It seems the District Training Leader's relationship with the District Manager can have a great impact on employees' ability to gain promotion. If a DM doesn't like the DTL who trained you, then there's little hope for upward mobility. If you want a low-stress manual labor job, and you have low expectations for ""moving up"" in the company, this is good place to stay.

(You'll be turning down promotions faster than you know it.) This place is a meritocracy and that's great.,"There are opportunities for growth but so few open positions. The bonuses are the smallest I've ever seen for the sales industry. How can you split a single monthly bonus of $50 with 3-4 people? For the amount of work required, respectfully, I don't think it's worth the compensation. You are the maintenance person and the sales person, and the manager. If you bust your hump and go the extra mile you may get lucky and take home a $20 bonus for the month? If you live on site you will actually make LESS $ per hour because they build it into your compensation but living on site comes with responsibilities too and isn't exactly ""free."" What is $200 a month to a company that continues to do so well when you're a contribution to that continued success? The compensation between assistant, store, and lead are not much different. What incentive is there to move up when it's more work and responsibility for $1-$2/hr more? If you aren't going for a rare DM position, why move up and take on the added stress and responsibility? You will use your personal vehicle for business purposes 3-4 times a week. You will/may have to clean up feces and or urine or vomit. You will/may deal with troublesome members of the homeless population and they'll be living on site and you'll be limited in your scope to do anything about it.

Management is willing to work with employees and help them with whatever they need.,They pay is low. They don’t do performance based raises. Just cost of living. There is no real benefit for working hard or going above and beyond. There also is no increase when the base pay increases for new employees. This means that a new employee could potentially be making more money than an excellent employee who had been there for a few years.,"Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Looks good on paper but read between the lines,2.0,"Feb 22, 2023",Very low key job. Easy to get stuff done and multi-task. Exceptional hours and benefits. The company has great values and rewards results.,The number one value of the company is integrity and the company completely ignores those with upstanding morals who are honest in their employment. Employees who lie and fake their numbers tend to be promoted over those who actually live the companies core values. The job can be extremely boring depending on the time of year and how busy your store is.

Miss this job.,5.0,"May 20, 2015","Freedom to work without someone always looking over your shoulder. My property was doing well financially and that gave me freedom to do things my way. So long as numbers were riding I felt respected and cared about. The customers are from all walks of life and you meet new people every day. Once I got a chance to speak with my DVP, he turned out to be one of the best and most motivational bosses I've had. My DM didn't like me talking to his boss though.","Sometimes they would actually search just to find anything out of place to complain about. A little oil and dirt in the tracks of the elevator done should be okay when the property is otherwise perfect. Never made a big deal about all I did right, but wouldn't let anything go that wasn't. Sometimes hard to communicate effectively with people above the DM. Any communication with upper management from a store manager seemed frowned upon. Too many politics and backstabbing managers who will do unethical things to make you look inferior to them or to get your property. Slow discipline by corporate lets the damage her too bad before removing a bad employee.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

But if the customer is walking out we have them sign a insurance rejection form. So it's not really required. Makes the employee look like an idiot! Constant rate changes that make customers mad.

They're going to run out of local customers sooner or later if they keep thinking along these lines. Corp. requires lease to be presented under 3 minutes, and it IS timed, making the employee look stupid as we're not able to really tell all that is involved in that time period. Dealing with irate customers due to Corporate changes on the local level that Corp. does not let it's employees, on the local level, know about beforehand. Performing weekly and monthly reports that nobody ever really shows you how to do. I didn't sign up to be an Analyst or a CPA.

Property Manager,2.0,"Jun 9, 2015","-Get Sundays off -Very organized company -Get your own apartment. Mostly just for managers and not for assistants. -There is decent advancement opportunity, but only if you're a ""yes"" man/woman - If your manager is cool and you do a very good job(store numbers are good) then they give you a lot more freedom and leniency than others.","-Poor pay -Micromanaged like crazy and upper management spies on you like creeps. For example, when you get a lead from the call center, a timer starts going off on your software so the company knows exactly how long it takes you to follow up with lead. -Have to do all the janitorial work on the property: rake leaves, clean units, clean the office, paint etc. I never really minded doing this, but the problem is you have to keep a walkie on you at all times in case a customer comes to the office and buzzes your walkie in which case you have to stop everything you're doing and go back to the office. Makes it very difficult to get things done efficiently. -The job is very property dependent. I worked at several different properties and if you get stuck with a run down property in a bad area, the job is absolutely horrible. I worked a site where there were break-ins every month, rodent damage, water damage, etc.. Basically just consisted of calling people every other day to tell them that their stuff was ruined or stolen. You're also making collection calls every day and dealing with auctions every month. If you get a nice property in a good area then the job is cake. -You will likely start out as an assistant and be expected to cover practically every store in the region. They won't tell you this up front though. Very difficult thing to do for experienced property managers let alone newbies.

I had an another assistant manager asked me why I took a coffee break. Business model of stores is antiquated. Instead of Assistant Managers, do store customer service and let each store be managed with one person not two. There is not enough work for two people to do the entire day, at times bored, be prepared to clean and do maintenance. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. There needs to be more female top level managers. The culture is still stuck in the 1970's. Too many males not enough females to management roles. No flexibility when it comes to working hours, hours long, traveling to other stores is expected, most employees who have been there for a time, feel guilty for taking a lunch or break. IF you are going to hire assistant managers, please do not hire someone who worked at Taco Bell and think they will be able to be competent at getting along with other co workers who where hired with diverse working backgrounds. Just does not woek.

Decent job depending on location of your site.,3.0,"Aug 17, 2016","The pros of working with ESS would be definitely be the benefits they offer. They offer accumulating PTO which you can start using as soon as you get hired. Great 4O1k, dental, vision, and life insurance. Medical is on the high side but the coverage it self is good. If your lucky you can get a live on site position. Not all the sites have apartments for the manager but most do. Free rent and utilities if you get to live on site however they will dock your pay 2.00 or more an hour if they give you an apartment.",Like I said in the title the way you feel about this job will depend a lot on the location. Sites with an onsite manager are usually better but that means you will have to play cop 24/7. Some sites are in really bad neighborhoods. You will find your self in constant battles with un desirable tenants that try to live in the storage units. Evictions processes are long and stressful especially in California. You will end up paying a lot of people off to get out of your facility. The company refuses to invest money in security even though they have the resources which has never made a whole lot of since to me. Why wouldn't we do everything possible to keep our tenant's and their belonging's safe? How bad could it really hurt the bottom line to invest in security guards and decent camera systems??? If your lucky enough to work at a site out in the sticks some where with out a whole lot of come and go traffic your job will be wonderful. Inner city areas not so much.

Extra Space,4.0,"Oct 24, 2018","Overall it's a great place to work. I've been with the organization for a few years now the moral and work life balance is great. I'm lucky to have a great DM who really works with the staff. The training, support and the perks are still fairly good. They offer bonuses which many companies and overall the company does a good job. The properties are well kept and it's a good working environment.","They have been cutting back a lot and sadly those cuts hit the field employees the most. They cut back on low waged employee bonuses and even gift cards. Granted that these items are perks but on the store level we are first liaison between the customer and management. They've also cut back on staffing budget allowances, and many stores are being left single staffed. This over works staff who are getting paid now as one individual but doing the work of two people. It also causes a danger concern having one individual working alone on a property. The turnover rate for the Assistant Managers are greater than any organization I've worked out previously. Due to low wages for the expectation of work. Another concern. It also makes it difficult for staff to take their hard earned vacations when there is no coverage. In turn this hurts the DM who are now unable to hire the right staff.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
A solid place to work,4.0,"Jul 26, 2019","The bosses really care about you and always ask what they can do for you to make sure you are doing okay. They encourage you to be open about any feelings you are having personal or professional. They also love growth in the company and encourage you to move up in the company, and are happy when you want to. Everyone in your district is also very wiling and able to give you a hand and help you in any way they can. The job itself is also very interesting, encompassing a lot of different tasks that you have to perform, and there is always something to do, and there are hardly any days where you are bored or you looking for something to do.","One small downside is that you do have to work 8 hour days on Saturday, which is a little vexing, but not too bad. But the main downside of working at Extra Space is the compensation. Sometimes when the days are long and you have 100 things to do while trying to rent to customer's, it does feel like we are inadequately compensated. For instance, I have to pay a lot of different bills every month. I just graduated college and am paying a student loan payment: I pay rent to my brother every month, I have a huge credit card bill, I pay for my phone, car insurance, utilities, etc. Some weeks I am barely squeaking by, and I am not able to put any money away for savings most weeks. For example, If I get into a car wreck, I'll be in a lot of trouble, because I have no way of paying for another car, unless I accrue more debt, which I don't want to do. I know my situation could be a lot worse and I'm not looking for pity, only being transparent. Also I am aware I'm still pretty new to the company. I'm only saying if I got paid just a few more dollars an hour it would save me a lot of worry.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Incredibly Mediocre,3.0,"Mar 2, 2021","The people are the best part of working at Extra Space. For the most part my coworkers were some of the best people I have known. Many were humble, kind, selfless. Extra Space does a lot of bragging about how long people tend to work at Extra Space and to an extent they are right. People work there for a long time, but it isn't necessarily because of Extra Space being the best place to work, it is because it is a tolerable atmosphere where people can focus on their family. One thing Extra Space does very well is Work Life balance. These humble people are exactly the type of people that Extra Space likes to employ. People who are humble and sometimes insecure, whose focus is on their family and not on the fact that they could be paid more somewhere else. They are just grateful to have a job. These individuals make great coworkers but can be easily taken advantage of by the company. They do a good job of promoting internally, which creates great opportunity for people who work at Extra Space, though they do this in part because they are not willing to pay the price for outside talent. They have great corporate values. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the fact that their philosophy and the way they behave are very different. Most of the time the behavior doesn't align with the philosophy. There are a lot of people at Extra Space with good ideas, but the execution isn't great.","The disconnect between managers and their employees is palpable. Software Development Management is involved too much in direction and not enough in managing/coaching employees. They want to be ""decision makers"" not leaders and managers. Mentorship will have to be found in coworkers, who may not have the time to help as it is not a part of their job description to do so. This is another example of where philosophy splits from behavior. They say they want you to help your team, they say they ""Experts Help"". Sometimes even when people take the time away from their own tasks to help, they are met by criticism that they aren't doing enough in their own jobs. These metrics that they are measured by are also not very nuanced. You are compared to your peers by number of tasks completed. So remember that task you helped your teammate complete? It didn't really matter in the long run, because he got the credit for it and it was used against you. Your coworkers perception of you is not taken into account in this judgement. So it can feel like you are just a number, not a valued employee. The company is a little too investor friendly in my opinion, meaning they are cheap. Obliviously this affects employee compensation. Their compensation philosophy is to pay people as close to, or below average if they can. They will label this as ""Competitive"". Their definition of competition is a little funny, because usually you want to be the best, not just in the middle of the pack. You will likely be under paid. ""Work/Life balance"" is part of your compensation package.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"Pretty good company, would recommend even with cons.",4.0,"Jun 3, 2021","Benefits; medical, dental and vision, friendly atmosphere; you feel heard and included, room for advancement if you're dedicated, allotment is given for shoes and uniforms annually, incentives based on store performance, PTO is usually approved and depending on the district manager you can pick your day off for the week. You are not micromanaged for the most part. Before the pandemic there used to be company meetings/spring kick offs, team building activities, paid lunch mileage to those events. Used to host a company paid xmas party (now just a yearly bonus). The ability to run your store and build some good relationships with customers.","Pay increases are small, taxed in incentives, only 4 paid holidays a year, have to work half day on xmas eve at regular pay, no overtime unless it is approved. If you work overtime, you have to either come in later, leave early or take a longer lunch which I don't believe is fair. If I stay late and miss out on my personal time to benefit the company I should get paid time and a half. The company doesn't like you taking off Fridays, Saturdays or Mondays so your 1 work week day off (besides Sunday) is limited unless you submit PTO (which you earn around 2.31 hours every week). Customers can rent online and with QR codes so why do we have to be at the site on a holiday when they can take care of everything themselves? Why can't we take off any day of the week we want if we are either double covered or can alternate with AM & SM's to make sure at least one is in the office.. Company wants your to get rentals and offers waiving of admin fees, free locks and credits to get the customer to rent that day but that reflects on your financials and you are questioned on how you are selling merchandise and why your waived fees were high etc. and receive coaching and guidance on how to boost those numbers. How do you boost your numbers if you are told to give away the farm? Most of the time the store manager/assistant manager can handle customer issues but if the customer isn't satisfied, it can get escalated and the customer usually gets what they want to retain their business. Customers expect you to bend over backwards for them and they turn around and trash your building that YOU have to clean and maintain. Examples include sweeping, mopping, and waxing floors, and cleaning all hundreds of unit doors by hand. Customer leave behind garbage and furniture that you have to throw away, break down or spend budget money to have a company come remove. You have to visit other competitors and pretend you are looking to get a unit so you can see how you compare to them. This should be done 1-2 times a year. If you visit them and give them your information they will probably remember you if you keep returning and they can most likely find you in their system from previous inquires which can make things awkward. You can receive calls at any time for a customer issue that gets sent to you from the call center. Example: Customer can't enter the building because the door is stuck closed and you have to go to the facility at 11 pm to fix it and end up staying later to make reports and call vendors. You get paid for that time, but as mentioned above, have to cut your time somewhere else.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

I am starting to learn there was A LOT, I missed out on, almost seems like being at a disadvantage. When problems arise there is a finger in your face, asking you why you didn't do this correctly. When realistically it came from not being taught correctly the first time or at all. It makes your job 100 times harder when you have to learn something on the spot. It's not fair for someone to feel like they are failing, when they don't know. Work expectations: I don't even know where to start with this one. You are literally, a maintenance man, janitor, a sales man, security, and a office representative. The workload for this job depending where your store is at in terms of progress. Is super unrealistic especially if you are the only person working the site. I have went home with massive headaches, stressing over the expectations of this job that had been put on me at the time. Even curranty there is always a massive ""bag"" of work, goals, kpi, auctions, google reviews, ect. Hanging over your head, you would like to be able to choose which project or situation seems more dire. But in reality it all needs to be accomplished at once. Or in a very short period of time. Pay: Pay needs to be matching the amount of work that is being put on an employee. Not getting paid enough to do massive amounts of work is frustrating in itself. Promises: Promises coming from management need to be handled more professionally, especially when it effects your life outside of work. Or your bills/money. This is a company that's defiantly not lacking in recourses. It's not fair to give hope on a situation that always seems to be getting put off. Currently I still would like to give things a chance, but I am a human with needs and a life outside of my job. If not I have to take care of myself and my mental health.

Great Place To Work At!,5.0,"May 7, 2022","I have been with Extra Space for 3 years as a Store Manager. I wish I would have got on board 20 years ago. This has been by far the most rewarding job I have ever had. I have been able to maintain my stores goals at a high level and won a “Mission Accomplished” award 3rd quarter of 2021. This is partly due to my personal work ethic and desire to grow personally. But, mostly due to the support from my DM, DTLS and other Managers that I work with. Every time I have reached out to them with questions or asked for help I have always received an immediate helpful response. My typical day is 50% office work and the other 50% is maintaining the property. Honestly, this can be challenging at times but if you prioritize your day/days you will succeeded. I enjoy the challenge and being able to move around the facility with the many different tasks presented to me. I enjoy coming to work because of the challenge and the opportunity to interact with my customers. It’s all about connection with the customers and providing them with solutions to their storage needs. What’s exciting is I have become friends with some of my tenants and have had others return for business. I’m building relationships and a good reputation in my city. Before you apply with ESS I highly recommend you Google the job responsibilities of the position. I have seen some reviews from past employees and I don’t think they read them. This company offers you to take responsibility of your store, handing you the keys to manage it and make it succeed. They also give you the tools you need to succeed.

This isn't due to lack of employees this is by design. They also expect the same level of cleanliness and service as when there were 2 employees even though I am single coverage every single day I'm working. So twice the workload with the same pay. Unfortunately this company is turning into a greedy corporate powerhouse. I literally heard the CEO tell us our revenue goal was ""this"" and we beat that by 4% but the shareholders are used to us beating it by 7% so we have to work harder. After that meeting is when I saw them cutting employee hours and even start shutting down certain sites one day during the week to save on costs.

The board of directors, executive team, and senior leaders (SVPs and DVPs) are primarily white and/or men. * Executives and senior leaders rarely seek critical feedback. And the company does not ensure a safe environment in which to do so. * Division Vice Presidents and District Managers have great power within their operational environment, with little oversight from the executive team.

Great Company to work for if you want a Strong Happy balance between your Career and Life,5.0,"Mar 22, 2017","Since day one I have seen the outstanding happy culture this company offers. When a person is working hard on their career it can be hard to balance out life, and family. I have found that this company allows you to balance out your career and life much easier than any other companies I have worked for. The culture around here is great because people are willing to help everyone succeed no matter what position they are in; we all work hard together as a team. It is very important that everyone has a passion for what they do and works professionally, but it is also just as important that everyone is happy everyday. I absolutely love the company and department activities we do. This makes us all work harder and feel more like a huge family rather than just a big corporation.","The only cons I can think of is this company does not offer any sort of tuition reimbursement. I believe this could help keep more employees work harder at furthering their career with Extra Space. I also believe they should have some sort of a system to help employees move up in positions so everyone is always working hard at that goal, and knows there is actually an end in sight to finally be promoted. This way employees are not just working for years waiting for a position to become available. I believe too many employees move on because promotions do not happen quick enough for some of them or they find better paying careers.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
"Care, appreciate, inform is what they want you to do....seriously they gave it to us on a key chain.",5.0,"Jun 29, 2017","I'm a 37 year old female and i've held jobs in many different places and types of companies, most of them more glamorous than this one. However this has been not only my favorite job, but my favorite company to work for. I'm a field employee, specifically an on-site manager. If you don't like change and constant improvement and you don't like to get in and get your hands a little dirty, this may not be the job for you. We are always changing how we do things, new ways to improve and streamline not only our work, but the customer experience. Is this part sales, yes, but we don't just shove product down the customers throat. They teach us to know how to best help people find what they need and give that to them. There's a little bit of everything to do at an on-site job. You of course sell, you rent units, you sell merchandise, you take payments ect. You also clean, paint, handle some maintenance and get to move around a lot, often outside. I love education they provide and enjoy the people I work with. You work as a team with other sites in your district, but also get to self motivate and work on your own sometimes. There are great incentives, contests, good pay and benefits. They encourage a healthy balance of work and personal life, they also have a yearly fit program to encourage a healthy lifestyle. Company itself continues to grow and I have no worry about job security.","No cons really, I don't know what it's like to work in other districts as i've been at my site for 4 years.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Great Place to Work,5.0,"May 7, 2022","I am loving the culture and the people that I get to work with. I enjoy the property management aspect as well as the customer interactions. The least stressful job I have had the pleasure to work at. I don't have a dull moment, I can be in the office or out on the property so I don't get restless with sitting in front of a computer or too worn out on my feet, it's really the perfect balance. The company is expanding rapidly and there in so much opportunity for growth and advancement as the company acquires what looks like 30 new sites a month. There are also many Live on Site apartments for store managers at some locations. What a great boon to help their employees live a more balanced life and save money to buy a house, save for their kids college in the future, etc.","The cons would have to be the pay. In the DC suburbs, I get paid $1 more than I did as a cashier at REI over the holiday season. That gives me the incentive to move into a store manager position as quickly as possible but that pay is really only $2 more an hour. They make up for the low pay with monthly bonuses based on the properties performance and number of new rentals. The SMs obviously get the better deal with 30% off the top and the rest split between the ASM and the SM by hours worked. This is great and I am thankful for the bonuses (also more incentive to get promoted asap for the better end of the bonus lol) but with inflation on the rise, gas almost $5 a gallon and food prices sky rocketing, the pay means I work a second side hustle bc the cost of everything looks bleak.

Sometimes end up working by yourself for months on end because of staffing shortage. The amount of pressure placed on managers for performance is truly excesive when considering pay and constant staffing issues. You are harassed if not meeting metrics. They promote themselves as having work/life balance but that is subject to change upon the company's whim. They are not handling COVID properly, and even forced us to work Sundays for 2-3 months to make up for the lost income during the first months of the pandemic. Employees that expressed concerns when being asked to work all 7 days a week during the pandemic where misstreated and disregarded. People working Sundays got reduced hours, or had to use personal leave time to make up for it. No risk pay, and only paid leave when COVID positive. Changes are made abrutly constantly with no forewarning the majority of the time. Training is more than lacking, only 1-2 weeks of training with a Lead, and then moved to the store for the Manager to make up for the rest. New hires are already being asked to work by themselves not even 3 weeks after starting, because of staffing shortages. No maternity or paternity benefits, and no sick leave.

Sketchy ethics got sketchier after pandemic,3.0,"Apr 10, 2022","Pay, hours, advancement potential, uniform allowance, employee discount on storage","99% of store positions are assistant manager or manager. You'll be told these aren't sales jobs, but they are, with the added benefit of janitorial and collections calls. In the actual stores, expect to have to deal with homeless people attempting to live out of their units, having to clean up human waste when customers just poo or pee on the floor. Yes, human waste in addition to folks not cleaning up after their dogs if they bring them in when visiting the units. Depending on where you are working, this can happen rarely or often. Store need major repairs? Expect to field customer complaints for months while the bean counters try to justify or minimize the expense. When leasing to a customer, you're expected to NOT mention the periodic rent increases when signing a customer up unless they ask. If you don't mention it, you're more likely to get a sale. But then the customer calls back 4 months later angry when the first increase hits. Sure, point out to them then that it's in the contract and they should have read it closer, but at least you got the sale! Corporate does give you a few options to compromise on the rate at this point, but you're only allowed to do it so many times a month, and it's tracked and brought up in your yearly reviews, so you're discouraged from doing it. In general, before the pandemic it was a great job. Hours were regular, pay was good, great benefits, great coworkers on a local level and a supposedly good corporate culture. Then the pandemic hit and the deeper corporate culture began to show through. Yes, corporate took employee safety seriously, but got really, really callous on customer relations. Company initially suspended customer rate increases at start of pandemic, for about 6 months. Corporate bragged to the employees about what a great shape the company was in despite the pandemic. Then rate increases were reinstated, and rents often doubled at this point. The rationale was ""to get the customers caught up to where the would have been"" if increases hadn't been suspended. Keep in mind that nationally storage needs were at a premium at this point all across the industry. Basically, they jacked up prices just because they could. Why is this bad for you, the store-level employee or customer service rep? The company executives left it to the store crews and customer service reps to deal with the infuriated customers, basically told us to tell them we sympathized, but they were welcome to move out. This left a lot of customer feeling trapped since it's often a huge pain in the rear and/or expensive and the customers took it out on the staff. Corporate response: We understand and appreciate you dealing with it, but too bad, so sad. Customers trapped out of the country due to lockdown did not necessarily receive notice when autopay failed, or the subsequent legal notices of pending auction. Again, pissed off people who lost a lot of personal and valuable items with no recourse took it out on store staff and customer service reps. Yes, it's a business and people need to keep track of their own finances, it's not the company's job to do that for them, but this was an extremely unusual and international crisis. The company handled it very poorly, while bragging about taking care of customers by stopping rate increases for 6 months.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"It's good, but it could be great",3.0,"Jan 26, 2023","In the field, a decent work/life balance. Every Sunday off and one Saturday a month. 9:30-6 weekdays, 9-5:30 Saturdays. Benefits are fantastic. They promote from within often. Monthly bonuses based on rentals, not any of the metrics attached to them. Mileage and travel time if you have to travel further than your home store. Some stores have the opportunity to allow you to live on site at a reduced wage but no monthly rent (unless you opt into their renter's insurance, then there's a small monthly fee). They do have opportunities for recognition, bonuses, and prizes. The company's culture is very progressive -- I attended a town hall in person with the CEO and other executives and they heard us out. Very cool stuff.","Training and onboarding needs a lot of help. I think during interviewing it's also not explained well what's expected of you, so there's a lot of turnover. That affects you by having to work alone a lot, being pulled to a lot of different stores (if you're an assistant), and everyone there to help you being stretched thin. PTO is the only time off you have and you accrue it per pay period. There's no separate sick or personal time. Because laws in each state vary, learning the auction process will go through your team leads and other managers. This can be confusing and difficult, and there's no official training from the company beyond basic functions in our systems we use because every state is different. There's a lot of disconnect between the corporate office, field, and call center. The work can be very taxing -- emotionally, physically, and mentally. You handle rentals, cleaning, basic maintenance, coordinating with vendors, customer service, collections, and facilitating auctions of foreclosed units. Juggling the phone, in person customers, and all of your other responsibilities is a lot, and although pay has gotten better, it's still not quite worth all the hassle. Working at the corporate level usually means being open to relocation and having a bachelor's degree at minimum.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Falling apart,1.0,"May 11, 2016","Not working on Sunday, seasonal work environment, better base pay compared to competitors.","No sense of direction (very indecisive), highest turnover rate I have ever witnessed, there's absolutely no structure (schedules were a constant disaster), district managers are always trying to take the easy way out because they're too busy running around like chickens with their head cut off. They never seem to be prepared for anything, everything always feels last minute, like they're winging it...chickens I tell you. They're constantly making changes without proper notification both internally and externally, it's pretty common to receive an apology email as an employee and/or customer because they failed to give notice of any updates and changes. They are growing fast, which sounds positive, but unfortunately they just don't seem have the qualified leadership to properly manage their daily operations. Company morale has been trending down for over a year from my experience and nobody seems to be willing to do anything about it. You hear a lot of great things, but soon understand that words mean little to nothing when it chines to the integrity of this company. Extra Space Storage used to be a great company and I used to enjoy working there, but I left because they are falling apart. With this acquisition we were experiencing a lot of employees leaving or being encouraged to leave, and yet somehow they seem to be more focused on the next person they want to fire rather than the next person they need to hire. Over my tenure I worked with a full staff for a brief stint of maybe one or two months. You will be constantly told to transfer to or cover other facilities because your district is always understaffed so be prepared to drive, but more importantly, be prepared to be told that you're going to work at another facility as late as the night before you're expected to work there.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

It's good experience for new college graduates that have never worked in accounting before.","The accounting department is really struggling. They have a huge staff and it's not organized very well. Current set up is really inefficient and the pay is pretty low. They have people with accounting degrees performing customer service and secretarial tasks. The company is growing so much that they're constantly increasing our workload but not our pay. Property accountants are forced to fill too many roles. There's a lot of pressure to meet deadlines and take on more work in less time. The company is growing but they won't increase our head count. Work isn't distributed evenly (check other reviews, some say it's a great Work/life balance and others say it's terrible). The good people have way more responsibility but aren't compensated for it. There is really high turnover in this department. Some people quit within a couple days or weeks and few make it more than a year. The turnover puts even more stress on those that stay. Everyone is burning out and it's creating a terrible work environment.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

You don't want to work here,1.0,"Jul 1, 2017",Extremely talented employees. A great place to build a network. Most of the employees leave within a year so you'll have networks into various companies.,"The bad reviews you read about this place are 100% accurate. I'm convinced the good reviews are from the owner and his family. The company was good at one point but nepotism has become the new norm. Turnover is extremely high. Professionalism is nonexistent. They are extremely paranoid that everyone is trying to take advantage of the company. People are frequently fired and decisions are made on emotions. We have to account for every single minute of our days and are extremely micromanaged. Our bathroom usage is monitored. One minute late is documented regardless of job level. Berating is common from the Executive Team. Lunches are 30 minutes and closely watched regardless of level unless you're family. Bonuses are talked about when you start but no one (other than the family) has gotten one over the past years. All of our jobs are posted even when we're still in them because the turnover is so high and this provides the flexibility if they want to fire someone. Truly, you do not want to work here. You'll be told you can be an entrepreneur here and build a career, but it's not true. Unless you are family you will have zero say in anything. You will hate it and most people leave before a year. You may be mad at your employer but you're better off where you are.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Time for some truth,1.0,"Jul 28, 2017","You will see plenty of ""pros"" to working with this company as they require their new employees to come onto this website and review them. And who would be stupid enough to say anything bad. So now that I am not employed with them let's just skip to the cons....","They work you like a dog and I literally mean a dog. We were taken over by them in August and were told we had 2 weeks to clean all units to their standards. So in the dead heat of summer they expected me to clean 140 vacant units within 2 weeks. I mean clean as in sweep out unit, clean back of the door, bush down the dust on the walls, microfiber rag the walls with a cleaner, spray pesticide and vacuum out the corners of the unit. That was just the beginning they had ridiculous goals that I didn't think could get any worse until 2017 hit and they require you to now get 90% of your new rentals with insurance. So 1 out of every 10 people could opt out of insurance for you to meet your goal. Not to mention you are required to get 4 Google reviews a month; people honestly panic over not having enough and then try to get each other or friends to post fake reviews for them. The company grooms you to speak a specific way to deceive your customers. Then they force you to force the brand new customer to give you a Google review before you can leave the office. The DM told me to send them the link to their phone then ask if they did it yet. If not then I was to say well go ahead and do it then once your done I'll take you outside to your unit. The DM has favorites and you can definitely tell. He treats people completely different depending on whether or not he likes you. The DM's will promise you growth in the company but then guess what, they also promised that same position to 3 other people! When I address the issue I am then told that anyone can go through training but not everyone's going to make it (a perfect example of the deceiving talk they try to teach you). Speaking of training they dont tell you until your on but you'll have to go through Extra Space University which will consist of weeks of going through online schooling, tests, check ups from your team leads and a paper or two before its all said and done. I think worst of all was that my assistant was making almost as much money as I was and with his mileage he was getting more! Yet some how I was at the cap of a managers pay and I would need to move up to get more money; but that job was hard to move up to when 3 other seniored ES employees had already been told they were next in line. I have worked for quite a few storage companies over the years and this is by far the worst one I have ever been a apart of.

Get a bit of exercise instead of sitting in a chair all day -Form good relationships with the long term customers that come in regularly -Decent benefits with healthcare, PTO and 401k - A growing business that wont go bankrupt anytime soon","Now ESS has implimented several things over the years and it only accelerated during Covid and they use it as an excuse, like everyone will just accept the suffering. It basically boils down to a few things, but mainly this company trying to squeeze every penny they can out of this business. That means less hours, less pay, more work, less supplies. Here is what that has lead to -Though you get to work on your own, managers are increasingly micromanaged on simple things we used to be able to do without question. -They have been eliminating the free apartment whenever possible and replacing it with rentable storage units. -Almost everywhere is running on a skeleton crew with most sites going with a single person running them. They cut hours across the board and expect the same amount of work to be done. -Working alone by yourself is kinda nice when you get to dictate your own work day, but working alone weighs on you after a while. Working with others is nice sometimes, which is way less common now -They're doing crazy things like closing certain stores an extra day just to save on labor costs - They are going toward automated system and self service kiosks to further reduce labor costs - Employees cant order anything without is being scrutinized, again for cost cutting measures. This means everyone has to run on minimal supplies and makeshift stuff to compensate. - High turn over rate and horrible employee retention. This compounds the low hours and makes running districts even harder. They cant seem to hire anyone either. - Company misrepresents jobs as sales and retail, when its half that and half facility maintenance. Ive seen several new hires quit due to this - Extreme pressure to sell and meet company metrics. Micromanagement extends to this to where they track literally everything you do. - Company insists on using internally developed programs and sales systems, instead of paying other companies. This leads to shoddy computers systems that fail constantly, dont work as intended and dont have the same function of the program they replaced. - Hypocritical company culture with focus on customers and employees, though they only care about customers to get them trust us to sell them more and turn on them as soon as it would cost us money. They say they care about employees but do nothing to satisfy our concerns over hours and lack of support, just say they are ""doing the best they can"" - They ask employees to care about our customers and put them first, but any amount of success you will get comes at the cost of selling your soul and treating customers like numbers and opportunities to sell and hit metrics -No way to advance beyond manager without selling your soul and paying LOTS of dues and being liked by the right people. This is just on top of the normal corporate stuff like office politics, favoritism, disconnect from management and field employees","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Don't do that, it's too much work and you can get away without doing it. They will give random bonuses, but if you look at how much money they are making, you will see that it is just an OK bonus.

A Great Place To Work!,1.0,"Aug 24, 2022","I've been working as a remote sales agents for over 10 years and this has been, by far, my finest experience. After your initial training period of a month and a month getting your feet wet, you are allowed to select your hours. The Sales team takes inbound calls every day, so you can work M-F or any combination of days and shifts. That's cool! After training you are assigned to a team of about 20 other reps ad you have a Team Lead. Each week you have a team meeting and a private 1:1 with your TL to work on your success metrics. The pay is competitive and is excellent for the top 10% of the more than 200 sales reps. Base pay is $15, with attendance, call conversion percentage commissions and other bonuses available. For example. I am in the top 5% of reps, based on total storage unit rentals and my regular 'take home' paycheck average is $1,150 twice a month, with a commission and attendance commission/bonus amount is $1,400. That totals $3,700 deposited to my checking account monthly. That grosses out to over $53K, or $26/hr. Excellent for remote gigs. The management is outstanding! Understanding, with no micromanaging here. You have access to all levels of management, from your immediate superior (your Team Lead) to HR, the Sales Director, IT, even the CEO. You have access to a myriad of metrics related to your performance. This allows you to pinpoint areas that are costing you money and ways to strengthen those areas. The primary metric used for agents is average conversion rate for the entire company over a three-month period-nicknamed The Floor. Here you can see where you compare to the average. A wonderful way to judge your value, without it being broadcast to the entire team' A particularly effective area for improvement is the ability to listen to other agents' calls. I have listened to over 40 different high performing agents and have found many techniques and methods to improve not only my closing skills, but also ways to have more fun. My final 'Pro' for working at ESS is that it is FUN! As stress-free as any job I've ever had, including being a top executive and a small business owner.","The pay, although quite acceptable for the top performers (and rightfully so), does tend to discourage the group hovering around the Floor, or below. Since the average is based on your prior and current three month performance, it is harder for these agents to move in to the upper echelon of compensation.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"Review for ESS / Extra Space Storage (via SMASH, Costa Rica)",1.0,"Sep 21, 2025",- Some people suited SMASH outsourcing company in Costa Rica . which was contracted for ESS. -They promove promotions and travel only for few people. -Toxic organizational culture -When I said something they removed the contract and start doing mobbing for not having responsability here in Costa Rica.,"Working with SMASH for Extra Space Storage was one of the worst professional experiences I have ever had. The environment was toxic and hostile. I was constantly subjected to bullying, mobbing, and inappropriate jokes about my personal life and even about my accent. It went as far as being spied on, and when I raised concerns, instead of addressing them, I was removed from my role. ESS showed no accountability and completely ignored my situation, hiding behind the fact that they are a U.S. company. Their only focus is cost-cutting, not the well-being or dignity of their employees.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Construction and facilities teams face persistent staffing challenges, which can impact morale and performance. Opportunities for advancement are limited in certain sectors, and there appears to be no clear strategy to address this.

Great place to work!,5.0,"Oct 25, 2021","This is one of the best companies that fully recognizes their employees and wants the best for them. From having over a dozen of coworkers that you can reach at any moment to being encouraged to be a better version of you via the Health Advocate website that they promote. A great blend of using technology in the office and putting some elbow grease into the property itself, learning to relationships with both customers and vendors, having a set schedule of open-close (when full time, and in most cases) so there is no working late into the evening, all around a great place to work!","At times (depending on the property you are working at) you will have to work by yourself. It can be incredibly difficult to get everything done in a timely manner when you first start. You have to have a backbone when working here, There is customers that will try and use your empathy against you to get their way, and in some cases will flat out scream in your face.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
ESS Review,5.0,"Oct 6, 2009","Extra Space is an incredible employer. It has a small company feel but the benefits of a large corporation. Career opportunities are numerous and only controlled by your own motivation, you have incredible amounts of freedom to run the site as you see fit and as long as the site remains profitable and you are within company guide lines it is yours to run.",Too many mystery shops conducted. There are 4-5 different kinds of mystery shops conducted each quarter. While not a huge negative it can sometimes become an annoyance.,"Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Supportive and inclusive place to work with grets benefits,5.0,"Oct 25, 2021","The entire team is very supportive and willing to help with any problems or questions you have. They offer great benefits (401k, health insurance, bonuses, pto) and, maybe best of all, they respect your free time. They will work to promote you if they see that you're interested and if you are generally good at what you do.","Customers can be rude and they'll direct their anger and/or bad attitude at you. However, unfortunately, that's a part of customer service. There is some light pressure to convert at least 80% of customers into buying insurance. KPI numbers are very important to them so there is also some light pressure to meet certain numbers. You only work with other person in the office, or by yourself at times, so it can get monotonous sometimes.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
"Overworked, underpaid.",2.0,"Sep 10, 2012",Most coworkers were cool. Given a lot of responsibility. They generally leave you alone to run the store how you see fit.... as long as it's working.,"Worked almost every Saturday. Constant mystery shops. Unreasonable expectations from management. Store performance is based on stupid measurements rather than important things like rentals, revenue, promotional use, merchandise sales, etc. Upper management always finds something to complain about. Your store can put up great numbers in every important financial category and they'll still complain.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Great to join the family!,5.0,"Dec 15, 2021",I joined Extra Space with almost 15 years of experience and after working for two other storage employers. I have found my peers in the District to be very welcoming and always ready to answer a question when needed. The District Team Lead was very thorough and patient throughout my training and is a great resource.,The option to schedule me at a different location or to alter my requested days off to accommodate others without my consent.,"Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
Very fun,5.0,"May 11, 2022","It's a lot of fun driving around on the gold cart, depending on the location sometimes you'll be on the cart most of the day just cleaning the property. Hearing about peoples lives and why they're storing with us is interesting, and it's also fun putting units up for auction. You get every Sunday off because the store is closed which is very cool, and days you need to call in you only have to give a 2 hour notice which is nice. You don't constantly have people in your face with problems, most problems can be answered over the phone and people prefer to call. You get compensated for driving extra miles daily like going to the bank or another store. They offer benefits and 401k after just three months. They're a very inclusive company and set up teams groups for all minorities so that you never feel alone, you can choose to join into those groups or not at all.","You have to be out on the property on very hot days- You have to clean units by hand the day that they move out, so if it's 100 degrees outside or if it's windy it gets pretty intense. You don't really know when your second day off will be week to week. Sometimes you work alone and you get a little swamped with all the things you need to do in a singular day. It's hard to explain to some people why their rate goes up and/or the amount of the increase, some people get hostile because it's their money. There are also tenants that go into auction almost every time they pay current and they're usually very hostile people too because they don't want to be called about their delinquency because it's a regular thing for them and they don't want calls every week.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
