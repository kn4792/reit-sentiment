Poor Senior Leadership and Lack of Strategic Direction,1.0,"Sep 24, 2025","Worked with a high-performing, mission-driven recruiting team that consistently delivered results in a high-volume environment. Gained valuable experience leading national initiatives and building programs that had real impact. Strong peer collaboration and camaraderie among frontline recruiters.","Senior leadership within Talent Acquisition lacks trust in their team and consistently fails to lead with strategy or vision. Decisions are reactive, not proactive, and often made without transparency or input from those closest to the work. There is a clear and persistent favoritism toward corporate recruiting teams, despite the high-volume team being responsible for filling the vast majority of roles across the company. Recognition, advancement, and compensation are not aligned with performance. Employees are expected to take on strategic initiatives or larger projects and scope of work with no end date in sight and without formal acknowledgment or pay equity. Concerns raised through appropriate channels were either ignored or met with vague responses, and in some cases, were followed by restructuring decisions that created unnecessary competition and instability. The recent return-to-office policy is rigid and outdated, with little regard for employee well-being or modern workforce expectations.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

In truth this place is a Logistical nightmare. RUN FAST! IT WONT GET BETTER!

Order selector,2.0,"Jul 30, 2025",Different learning experience for sure. Decent pay for staying local.Acknowledging that this offers a different learning experience is important. It likely presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth. The chance to remain local while earning a living is also quite appealing. This could create a better work-life balance for many individuals. Perhaps the pay is enough to cover essential needs and even allow for some enjoyment. It is a great chance to build a career and learn the ropes. These factors might make this opportunity an interesting choice.,Seems that alot think negatively of the employer. And they expect alot to be accomplished in less then 5weeks it seems. If you don't from experience they'll terminate you.It appears that many individuals harbor negative perceptions of the employer.

Do not work here,1.0,"May 17, 2024",It was an awful experience,I was told “I wouldn’t have ever hired you”. The head of HR told me this,Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm
Close to home,3.0,"Oct 7, 2023",Work is very close to home and my supervisor is probably the best supervisor I’ve ever had. He is very flexible with my hours being i and a single father who has split custody so some days I have to come in late or i am unable to stay late when it’s busy. But he also knows that I will come in in the middle of the night of on the weekends to finish repairs so we have enough truck to get the freight where it needs it to go on time.,Being it it a publicly traded company it is much more difficult to order and stock parts me need to do our jobs. Also tools for the shop that the employer would normally provide either never get purchased or a technician has to refuse to repair a machine/ truck until they have the proper tools for safety reasons. This is not at fault of our shop supervisor but more of the hoops that they would Have to Jump Through to get such purchases approved. Since americold purchased halls warehouses over 2 years ago we still have yet to receive a parts washer so we are forced to use far more brake clean than would be normally used. Not only a waste of money but a hit to employee health and safety. Also understaffing is a huge problem. I have a few friends who I would have apply but the income offers are laughable sometimes. I feel like if you pay good wages you will Get the people who want to work and take pride in it. And you can easily weed out the people who don’t want the money. But It just in our department that is understaffed but everywhere it seems. I have tried numerous times to get my child support payments taken out of payroll before direct deposit with no luck. Even been arrested and released due to this issue. But I also understand that the HR rep that I have has a lot of other people she is responsible for and things slip through the cracks. I do love working here and the people i directly work with but we were promised apt when americold took over like all brand new tools and lunches every month and much more and we haven’t seen any of it. And might I add when corporate reps came around after the acquisition of halls they talked a good game they said we brought each of u a gift… it was hats and water bottles. But they didn’t bring enough for everyone… that right there kinda set the tone. I did receive a raise when they took over which was nice but it was nowhere near what I was offer at other companies 2 years prior coming out of technical school.

In the long run, Americold will have a well integrated and competitive operation. There are some good learning opportunities for many people along the way.","A private equity company named Yucaipa calls the shots and Yucaipa is run by billionaire Ron Burkle. The strategy a few years ago was to invest, grow, and go public. The Versacold acquisition added a lot of debt and antiquated systems. The investment was made but the growth didn't follow, in part because of the economy. Going public turned out not to be an option. The management team that initiated and was executing the strategy has been fired or has quit and been replaced by a team that is charged with a strategy of cutting cost, leveraging the company with debt, and returning more profit to Yucaipa. This is why there have been layoffs the last couple of years and a difficult work environment for those that remain. Yucaipa certainly has a right to recoup their investment, but this will be difficult for the employees and customers to handle over the next few years.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

Workload is not equivalent to the pay unless you are VP or above, and then the paradigm shifts in the other direction. Appreciation is only communicated in a halfhearted verbal method, and never interprets into pay increases or other benefits. ""Merit Increase"" program is actually an annual across-the-board cost of living increase. No matter how much merit you bring to the table, you will often see the same increase as some of your lazier and less-motivated counterparts. The Human Resources team is a toxic group with multiple agendas and unchecked power. They are very intrusive, manipulative and controlling. I worked for Americold for more than 5 years, and built tons of good personal relationships - NO ONE LIKES THEIR JOB. I have never heard anyone brag on this company, or defend it when someone else bashes it. The shame of it all is that Americold has the resources and funds to be the absolute best company in the industry, but no one wants to take the time to creatively motivate, incentivize or appreciate the people doing the legwork.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

This has led to understandable growing pains, confusion and inefficiency -The warehouses themselves only started keeping real records a few years ago, so there is NO reliable data available before 2013 or so -The data the company does get is both incomplete and unreliable, though management seems content to act based on bad information -Middle management is aloof and doesn't seem to care about the goings on among regular employees -An overly aggressive HR department makes an already conflict-rich environment even more contentious -Constant turnover among all levels of the hierarchy has left people uneasy.

Average company with alot of transitional turnover,2.0,"Apr 27, 2014",Because of the high turnover rate there is always an oportunity to start on 3rd shift and move to first or second shift. Hourly employees have good benefits as far as paid time off and the ability to work over - time to compensate for the mediocre wage. Health care is good for what you contribute each month.,"As a supervisor you are salaried 50 hours a week, this equates to less than an houlry wage of the people you are supervising. Because the headquarters are in Atlanta, I don't feel the company values trickle down to the facilities. Alot of focus is given on customer service, which is great for job security, but the employees are not recognized for the sacrifice.

Stay far away from this company,1.0,"Nov 6, 2021",There are zero pros to working for this company.,"No leadership. No training, you have to try to figure it out. If you’re in any supervisor or manager position, they expect you to work from 5am to 10-11pm with no additional compensation. They have a revolving door of temporary workers so they don’t have to invest in hiring anyone. Absolutely terrible employee treatment. Upper management will yell at anyone in front of other staff. Front line employees are treated as expendable and replaceable. Sexual harassment investigations are not followed through with HR, they claim they investigate it but take no action when multiple people are filing claims against the same person. Women are treated as gophers and expected to cater to General Managers on any whim they may have. If you try to take a day off, you are harassed by management and told you are not a “team player”. Then they will call you multiple times on your day off and tell you that you have to come in, or you will get fired - even if you’ve stated that you have consumed alcohol and cannot drive. Personal and confidential employee information is easily accessible, often times it’s left in folders around the office or just thrown in the trash can with no shredding.

The organization lacks the man power to keep the floors clean. Ice cubes are everywhere, and one single ice cube can take you out permanently. Broken open boxes of food are everywhere, and everything is frozen, adding to slipping hazards. The equipment (pallet jacks) operate poorly, forcing you to strain when steering. There incentive program allows employees to make $4.00 an hour more if they exceed the formulated performance level by 35%, in other words, working at a rate equal to 135% effective. Mathematically, the extra 35% effort is rewarded at less than the starting wage. The company benefits greatly by paying an incentive vs. OT Finally, after injuring my back, I found the company's HR department completely disregard all my emails, phone calls, and requests to further investigate my particular circumstances. Fairness and Openness are two of the company's core values.

Great People Horrible Management,1.0,"Mar 15, 2013",Hard working people that want to work. Overtime is always available. Pay is okay but it is a cold environment so it could be better.,Upper management only cares about themselves. They blame supervisors for everything and force them to come in early and stay late and work on their days off. All of this while taking way the extra pay supervisor used to get for working when they were supposed to be off. Schedule is always over booked and management forces supervisors to mandate associates to work over almost every day because they can't manage the customer.

Commercial Paralegal,2.0,"Dec 1, 2016","This is an established company that continues to grow in the industry, I believe. The people I work with and have met from other departments are very nice. They seem to like their positions.","I've only been here for a couple of months, but I have a lot of cons. First, the work area where I am situated is right in front of the copier (Legal, 5th FL, corporate office, ATL, GA). Therefore, it is noisy when the printer is being used, people are in and out and talk REALLY LOUD as if I am not there. If I am taking a conf. call or trying to concentrate, it makes for a hard time. I've asked for a better spot, but no results yet. Secondly, I wasn't aware until my orientation day that the PTO is only 2 weeks, to include vacation AND sick time/personal time. I would expect that if PTO vs Vacation/sick time, the company would provide 15 days (3 weeks) at a minimum. There is not work life balance when an employee cant use at least one full week of vacation (deducting sick time, dr. appts, etc, there's not much left). Lastly, they need to increase the number of company holidays. For ex, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas eve, MLK (which is a national holiday so not sure why we aren't observing it). Offering the option to tele-commute once a week would also help. Most progressive companies allow this and it enhances employee moral.

You might even develop a backbone because of how much you get walked on here!,"Everything. Working at Americold incites the same feeling as entering a dangerous map in a video game: you hear the ominous music upon entry and immediately have your guard up in case of attack. The HR department is hostile territory. The People who work there are vindictive, conniving, and only interested in their own personal gain. ""Teamwork"" doesn't apply here, especially if younger than everyone else. Your ""Peers"" will see you as inferior and take advantage of you. Management, which is full of incompetent and biased individuals, will only look out for their favorites. It doesn't matter how hard you work or how far of the extra mile you go, it's never enough. If the ""favorites"" are against you, everyone is. Despite complaints and tip line calls, management does NOTHING to fix the problem. You might get the same motivational speech every single time instead... I was denied vacation time for an emergency when literally EVERYONE in the department got approved to use their time for leisure trips. I was forced in at unreasonably early times when they know I work a 2nd job at night.

Horrible,1.0,"Oct 21, 2015",Nothing. There was nothing I liked about working here.,"Everything. This is the number one worst place I have worked my entire life. Too cold (obvious) but that was the least of the troubles. The management team was so, so terrible and unprofessional. They would belittle employees and treat them like they are children. God forbid you park your lift to use the restroom for 2 minutes. Or find an inventory error and have to drive out to the inventory (every 20 minutes this happened) to have those guys belittle you as well. The work was horrible. Case pick and full pallet pick all mixed together, from anywhere in the warehouse. Whatever pick you pull up on your screen, you must complete it. No freedom or control whatsoever of inventory or pick orders. You can't chsnge the location of anything in the warehouse. There are some orders where you have to scan each individual case on the full pallet. Sometimes you have to tear apart the entire skid to scan each case so the weight of the cases can be entered into the system. There is an option where you can enter the full weight of the skid manually into the system without having to do all this work, but of course the inventory guys won't let you do it. The other people who worked there were very rude. Probably because their job sucks. Everyone drove their lifts like idiots. There was NO safety involved. They preached safety at the orientation but no where did I see it when I got out to the floor. We had to stand on our forks to pull 40-50lb boxes down from the tops of 8ft tall skids, and do it fast, while freezing cold. The production was BS.

Cold is the key word,1.0,"Sep 15, 2018",Some of your colleagues are nice and fun people.,"Pay is average at best. Difficult to get promotions unless someone retires or quits. Bonuses are very hush hush. Most people don't even know they exist and there is no real consistency behind who gets them regardless of what they say. Leadership is laughable and will try to bully subordinates then brag about it in meetings while simultaneously cowering in the face of any executive. Some people in middle management will smile in your face then speak very negatively of you when they think you're not listening and will directly impede your work efforts if collaboration is needed. No cups in the break room. The workload is unapologetically unreasonable. Most people are working the jobs of an entire team on their own and they are not happy about it. Of course, they begin to lash out and develop poor attitude after being overworked by the company. During the review season, employees are encouraged to not rate themselves too high, making it easier to justify waiting ""another year"" for a promotion. Continued growth and development is not really supported because they are afraid that employees will grow too much and take your skills elsewhere.

Good luck trying to use your earned PTO while being interrogated with questions on what you are using your PTO for (it's no one's business). Using sick hours is almost impossible since you get bullied for pretending to be ""sick"" when it is apparent. How this is sanitary and safe for a food storage facility is beyond me. They are constantly understaffed due to the lack of quality hires and no one being able to withstand the toxic culture longterm. People are hardworking and push themselves to the point of exhaustion, health complications, and lack of self care and mental health, and I have witnessed so many employee deaths during my time here. Many women I have worked with have been harassed, but the agressor do not face any consequences. Instead, management will ask if you have done anything to provoke their behavior and advances. This is definitely the good ol' boys' club culture.

No Work Life Balance,1.0,"Jan 14, 2023",Hiring process was seamless and fast. Plenty of lighting in the warehouse. Most workers willing to help and answer any questions. Store and fast food right down the street for breaks.,"Inventory issues: Many racks/bays missing labels making location overrides difficult. Item not is designated locations and often in Bay above or below or either side or not at all. When doing directed work go to location and item is not there. Item is behind front pallet. why is system having us take 1 to 2 pallets down to get to one pallet very inefficient. Sometimes second pallet is also incorrect very frustrating. Missing pallets could be above below to the right or left or in/at end the aisles it’s a huge problem. Facilities Maintenance Issues: Battery Changing Room has dozens of bays without chargers. Labels don't make any sense.  Older batteries don't last nearly as long and new batteries are hit or miss 70-90% cap. No battery staged on carriage after changing.  Most batteries are lacking proper maintenance and look like they are in bad shape.  Deteriorating hoses, valves, caps, & wires… Floor is cracked and uneven throughout facility especially at cooler entryways. Damaged racking Men’s locker room is a mess and deteriorating. Many toilets and sinks not working. System Issues: When staging wall locations don't work with wireless scanners requiring hand input for staging. Confirmation/acknowledge screen lacks last 4 numbers of order number. Wired scanners continuously mis-scan due to the amount of bar codes all in one spot. Wireless scanners are difficult to pair to vmu LTO are not credentialed to make changes to vmu. Can't even get to Bluetooth settings to pair scanner because IT has vmu locked down running login log-on scripts preventing users from accessing basic settings and apps like clock/calc. Ridiculous! When scanning staging area codes with wireless scanner you get the wrong input data. When scanning with wired after successful scan goes to case field instead of quantity field. After scanning an invalid pallet and setting the pallet aside then scanning correct pallet the system adds a zero to the field. Should be able to scan...field gets cleared...new number is input in to field. Paper inspections instead of computerized like iwarehouse. In 2 deep racks there will be two different products and system will ask you to get the deep pallet instead of face pallet. This system issues is the worst imo…let's say Red Prairie asks you to go to a 4 deep bulk bay to get a pallet that has 79 instead of 80 that pallet could literally be anywhere in that bay so you go to a cooler bulk bay and the pallet could be on any level a-f front middle rear. You have to go digging to find it! Process Issues: A few times per shift there will be tags on the product that are considered dead tags...third party reprint and still doesn't work requiring you to manually type in and re label. Evidently this happens because personnel unloading trucks neglected to re-label. Then they putaway by manually entering the number. So when you get assigned to pick that pallet you are not able to scan. Having to fill out slip for every pallet despite all the same product/order. Having to get off the lift several times throughout the shift to scan a pallet because the tags are not in correct location or behind wrap or non existent. Quality of life/work life balance: Can't have coffee coco unless you're on break yet coffee maker and coco packets are in control room not break room. After being in the -10 cooler for a couple hours back and forth would be nice to have access to hot beverage or heated room for several minutes that doesn't count against breaks. Floor suspension does not provide shock and vibration protection on several lifts causing knee and back pain. No notice for extended shift. Do not adhere to set schedule. They expect people to work 6 days a week 11 hours per shift with an unpaid lunch. In the beginning they will lie to get you to work for them claiming 4on 4off $26 an hour easy to get the incentive. It’s all lies! Expect same amount of work with half the personnel. No incentive unless list picking you'll average -30% to -40% if doing replenishment, putaways, staging outbounds. Expect to be at  -40% to -20% with all the inventory issues, dumped pallets, incorrect or missing pallets, having to wait on other LTO's to list pick...On a good day you might hit 0. They claim it's possible to reach +15% which would be the $24.50 plus 1.50 night differential but I doubt it. With all of the inventory and system issues you'll rarely hit +15% and if you were to hit that percentage consistently they'll make accusations of cheating the system. I have 3 years reach truck experience and 6 total forklift experience and never hit +15%. Best percentage based on reports was -32% and that was with me running all the stop signs and horn blaring! Management issues: Supervisors spend majority of shift in office. Managers have no idea what's going on totally oblivious. Blame game for anything and everything. I’ve never worked at a warehouse that had a general manager…what for?! Supervisor mistreated everyone spent entire shift in office not doing anything.
