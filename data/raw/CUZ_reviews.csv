Exciting company for anyone in finance and development but accounting positions were not so great.,3.0,"Feb 4, 2020",Its an exciting company to work for if you're involved on the finance or development side of things. They show great promise and continued growth. They totally dominate most of the markets that they are in.,"Located in Buckhead, where traffic is a nightmare but they're right on the buckhead marta station. The employee review process was broken. Your bonus was not based on how well you performed. It was tied directly to the company's overall performance, which actually wasn't the worst thing since the company had done well while I was there. But the issue was that your performance review literally did not matter. We had the ability to work from home but were rarely allowed. I don't know if this has changed since I've left. Most people on the accounting side were unhappy and starting to look for other jobs by the time I had left. Lots of people spent their entire careers at the company and were overlooked for senior positions, which were given to outside hires. This had a large effect on the employee morale for people in accounting.",Cousins Properties,CUZ,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cousins-Properties-Reviews-E1307.htm
Company and culture have changed - not in a positive way,2.0,"Jun 15, 2020",Nice buildings with free soda and coffee.,"For the past three years - the company has become very political and a very cold environment. Everyone from the CEO to HR has become harsh and it appears that they have forgotten what previously made them a good company- their people. Benefits cost are becoming a burden on employees, employees seem to be set-up and fired, their is a lack of employee voices being heard, employees are treated harshly and expected to work more than 10 hours per day and weekends.",Cousins Properties,CUZ,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cousins-Properties-Reviews-E1307.htm
"Horrible Culture-Unprofessional, Back-stabbing, Not inclusive",1.0,"Oct 11, 2022",Nice properties and nice offices,"The worst upper management I've ever seen. They may be a great company in Atlanta but Austin is a nightmare. There is so much turnover, favoritism, back-stabbing, verbal abuse and an overall lack of consistency or standards. The culture is non-existent, no meaningful interaction within or between offices. Maintenance, Admin and Customer Service have suffered as a result of constant turnover, no traction possible. HR doesn't care or get involved to solve any issues. Don't damage your career or reputation by being associated with this company. The worst place I have ever worked. Don't believe the positive reviews, they must be written by upper management or HR. Note-No hybrid or work from home, 100% on site, outdated paradigm. Benefits are just ok, high deductible.",Cousins Properties,CUZ,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Cousins-Properties-Reviews-E1307.htm
Disconnect between Atlanta and other locations,3.0,"Feb 4, 2016",Lots of opportunities to learn and take classes; fairly generous PTO schedule.,"HR and Accounting are absolutely AWFUL!! The benefits packages is a joke - they pay your monthly premiums if you do medical screenings but they only have High Deductible plans and the single person annual deductible is $3250!! This totally discourages people from going to the doctor and is the exact opposite of what they are trying to accomplish wit the ""wellness"" program. Atlanta is the HQ and they do an awful job of communicating with the other markets.

Notice hard work.,"Low pay for industry standard. They say its compensated by the benefits, which looses its luster after you hear that so often.
