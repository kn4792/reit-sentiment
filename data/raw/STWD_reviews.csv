Don’t say you were not warned,1.0,"Aug 26, 2024","Decent comp and benefits, good ERP system, diverse investment strategy",I can only opine on the acctg dept. Toxic work culture. Very high turnover. Lots of politics and favoritism. No room for growth unless you kiss up and give your life to the company. CEO barely shows face and wants people in office. CFO is very difficult to work for. She lacks leadership skills and EQ and cultivates a terrible culture. She isn’t a parent so she doesn’t understand or respect working parents. HR is not to be trusted and everyone knows it. They only look out for sr mgmt and themselves. It’s every man for themselves at this company. No team environment - quite depressing. Stay clear of this place.
