,1.0,"Mar 27, 2025",None zero. I like my friends who are here going through this with me,"It’s impossible to overstate the sheer dysfunction of the leadership at Crown Castle. The directors, VPs, and senior managers operate in a constant state of chaos, unable to keep a single concept straight without overcomplicating everything to the point of total collapse. Their decision-making is erratic at best, and at worst, it’s a complete disaster—disjointed priorities, knee-je-k reactions, and a total disregard for structured execution. Instead of fostering clarity and direction, they create confusion and frustration, leaving teams scrambling to make sense of their ever-changing demands. And then there’s the standout example of toxic leadership—the worst of the worst. This individual’s management style is a masterclass in incompetence: micromanaging every detail one minute, then being utterly absent the next. Their leadership is driven by paranoia, unnecessary pressure, and a complete inability to provide clear, actionable guidance. Instead of empowering their team, they break them down, fostering an environment of fear, distrust, and burnout. The result? A demoralized workforce stuck in an endless loop of firefighting, with no real progress ever being made. Crown Castle’s tower leadership isn’t just bad—it’s actively destructive. Not going to happen but until serious changes are made at the top, expect the dysfunction to continue. You all deserve better.

"Company has potential, but avoid till 2025",2.0,"Jul 23, 2024","There are very few sections of the telecom industry that have solid assets. Crown has long term leases on owned infrastructure - cell sites, fiber, and small cells. Working for a company with assets is preferable to working for a company that doesn't, like ATT, TMO or Verizon. Crown makes ALOT of money, so there's a chance to earn a good salary along with good benefits and stock.","The company is recently suffering from lacking an identity. Recent activist investor attacks have left it reeling with internal strife, layoffs, lack of direction, and poor C-level leadership. It has potential to be a great company, but for now it's a tough place to be. Of course, I was laid off along with 300 other last month so my perspective is a bit skewed, but I was there for nearly 11 years, so I watched the company go from being a great place to work to all of us wondering if we were next on the chopping block.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

The CEO ""resigned"" due to a PE firm taking a large stake in the company and forcing him out(don't really care he was just a ceo). The culture has changed significantly as well, They changed the corporate values to match their new initiatives such as 4 days back in the office as opposed to 3 in office and 2 from home. The Pay flat out is less than market rate and they will not give raises very easily you have to beg and plead for increases as we only receive 3% annually if you are lucky.

In the past 8 years, it just continues to decline. The CEO has made it very clear they have zero interest in listening to the people who do the actual work. They act like they care, but then when the employee survey is sent out, they either skim over or completely disregard the areas that have negative reviews. During the layoffs, it seems like they wanted to get rid of everyone that knew how good Crown used to be. Now they are reorganizing the entire company and the people that are left will now have to clean up the mess. Just a few years ago, they wanted everyone to be able to work most roles from anywhere in the country. People were encouraged to apply for positions regardless of where they sat. Now, it seems like they are going back to districts and requiring people to move to Houston or get let go if they are not in a ""regional role"".

Internal Hiring - A joke of a process,1.0,"Mar 26, 2024",Benefits Supervisor Building is nice,"Applying for roles as an internal candidate is demoralizing. I will never apply for an another role at this company. The interviewer will probably be conducted by a mediocre at best, middle-aged man who starts the interview off with the most archaic and antiquated question a person can ask in an interview setting. Saying, “So tell me about yourself” is the least engaging and most juvenile way to begin an interview. Do better! Again, I will NEVER apply for another role here. Do not waste your time reading through all the fluff in the job descriptions. The hiring managers do not even know wtf they are looking for, besides looking to waste your damn time with impromptu, non-professional interviews. They purposely do not seek to hire strong internal candidates. They hire those who are equally as competent as they are, never the stronger more qualified candidate. It’s literally an ego thing. All in all you either need to kiss butt, or just be incompetent to be promoted to another role. I shall do neither. I’d also like to add they straddling the fence when it comes to being well on their way to receiving an EEOC claim if they do not take a look at their hiring patterns, both internally and externally. I hope to be gone from this place soon, and instead at company that recognizes intellect, talent, and transferable skills when it’s in front of them.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Non Confidential,2.0,"Aug 4, 2023","Honored to partner with some fantastic People Leaders while at Crown Castle as they dealt with multiple reorganizations, switching priorities, and lack of OKR's or overall objectives. Whether in the field or otherwise, most are working hard with limited resources and give their all on a consistent basis. The team members outside of the coaching department were knowledgable and lived into the B3 values that are now defunct keeping the culture alive was a struggle with the Executive Team.","I worked directly with People Leaders as a Leader Coach and enjoyed my time with each one. The Cons come in unfortunately with the departments lack of honesty, integrity, and trust that has been ongoing with request by senior leadership for ""reporting"". Will keep to just the objective facts which would are completely true and leadership would have the reports available. 1. Confidentiality - People Leaders are informed that their coaching sessions are confidential which is not truthful at all. Discussions about specific coaching sessions with leaders are held between coaches, HR, and other business leaders around personal coaching sessions. 2. Tracking without Consent - Without People Leaders knowledge, coaching sessions are ""graded"" by their coach and captured in an MS Forms document which is distributed to talent leadership and members of the executive team. Questions such as how did they show up emotionally? What mindset did they display, Fixed or Growth, and other subjective questions around did they display a fragile, robust, or antifragile mindset. Too many questions to list here, fact is People Leaders had no idea this was occurring and the coaches didn't have any training on how they could grade effectively in these areas. 3. Business Insights - Once again without consent or knowledge, discussion points that are brought up in coaching sessions which are supposed to be confidential are included in an actual ""Business Insights"" report so if you bring something of value and confidential, it will be captured in this report and sent to leadership. 4. No Process - For the most part, there is no coaching process and coaches don't have credentials or training which means no targets, goals, or measurements are built out to show progress. Some coaches work minimal hours through the week while representing a full schedule. This can be easily verified through teams meeting reports as almost all the coaches were just holding sessions virtually.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

You don't find this at other companies.","Change in leadership destroyed the company, its core values, and morale. There were 3 major reorganizations in 2 years, and a single minded focus on customers with no regard for the long-standing relationships with landlords or other aspects of the business that secured assets and created profit. Under this new direction, employees were instructed to put all work aside for all but one customer which ultimately angered other major customers and resulted in strained relationships, cancelled work, and lost revenue. The abuse of power and misguided direction was a major contributor to the recent layoff of at least 20% of the workforce along with the elimination of key departments within the company that seriously impacted lives.

"1,300 people being laid off",1.0,"Nov 1, 2023",There are/were great people here,"Dear Jay Brown, I am writing to you today as one of the 1,300 employees who will be displaced by the recent decision to close the Canonsburg office and move to Houston. I am deeply disappointed and confused by this decision, and I am struggling to understand how it is aligned with the company's values. The average household size in America is 3. This means that your decision will not only disrupt the lives of 1,300 people, but also the lives of their spouses, children, and other family members. That's a total of nearly 3,900 people who will be affected by this decision. I understand that businesses need to make difficult decisions in order to remain competitive. However, I believe that this decision is unnecessary and harmful to both the company, its employees, and their families. How will this decision affect our customers? The Canonsburg office is home to many of the company's most experienced and knowledgeable employees. These are the people who are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining our wireless networks. Moving these employees to Houston will inevitably lead to disruptions in our services. How will this decision affect our employees? Moving to Houston will be a major disruption for many of our employees. Many of them have families and homes in Canonsburg. They will have to make the difficult decision of whether to relocate their families or find new jobs. Even for those who are able to relocate, the move will be expensive and stressful. The offer you provided for relocation assistance in your email on Friday feels disingenuous, because it doesn’t factor in the full cost of the move financially and emotionally. Those 1,300 people will have to find new homes, schools for their children, and new jobs for their spouses. How does this decision align with our company values? One of our company values is ""People matter."" I believe that this decision shows a lack of respect for our employees and their families. Another of our company values is ""Us together is better."" I believe that this decision will divide our company rather than bring them together and will make it more difficult for us to work together effectively. Finally, one of our company values is ""Doing the right thing, always."" I believe that this decision is wrong. It is wrong for our shareholders, it is wrong for our customers, it is wrong for our employees, and it is wrong for our communities. I urge you to reconsider your decision to close the Canonsburg office. I believe that this decision is unnecessary and harmful to both the company and its employees. Sincerely, A Concerned Employee P.S. I would like to remind you of the following: ""Do to others as you would have them do to you."" (Matthew 7:12) I believe that this decision violates the spirit of this verse. It is not fair to put your employees through this unnecessary disruption to their lives. I hope that you will take this to heart and reconsider your decision.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Crown says you have to ""drive your own development"" and will dangle the carrot of another opportunity in front of you to get you to do more then yank it away and say you didn't do enough to drive your development.

We were restricted from eating foods that were too noisy, too pungent, or overall a ""distraction"". Many people on my team were questioned why they were in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes, how many times a day they went, and watched like a hawk. (To be honest, have you ever tried drinking 60 fl oz of water a day? You go. A lot.) They've recently started firing several of their longest team members who were hard working and loyal to the team. Crown is VERY big on their B3values. Be real, be accountable , be an owner. The management in Asset Integration really needs to work on the ""be real"" part, as they have a habit of misleading and not being clear of expectations, but then reprimanding and writing up employees for it.

My roadblocks are cleared by my managers, my team is solid, and our dedication to our internal and external customers is high. The culture is about fairness, customer obsession, and win-win-win cooperation- a rare target to actually hit. I came from a polar opposite company and found Crown to be a welcome change. The company cares about trying to maintain sane & balanced employees, even though they can sometimes ask for your blood to put out the fires. Lower management is dedicated to supporting their teams in every department I have engaged with. The total compensation over time is reasonably generous. Available PTO is acceptable. Unofficial, but official flexibility is very real and used effectively to address worker needs beyond a slightly overly bureaucratic Business Resources. Training can be hit-or-miss, but the company is supportive of continuing education. It is clear that the company believes in investing in employees. The company seems to be well placed to continue to grow in good and bad economies. The continuing integration of its verticals will continue to increase the per-worker dollar return, which the company seems willing to share with labor.","On occasion, being an REIT versus a technology company does show. The company leadership are not technical in some significant facets of the company's operation. Built like a 50k person enterprise for an actual population an order of magnitude smaller.

Talk about tone deaf and callous. This company rewards hard work and dedication with bonus cuts and lay offs! When you're no longer needed in your role, instead of being shifted to a new role, they just get rid of you.

Leadership is slipping,2.0,"Oct 2, 2019",Great team members. Good pay and benefits.,"Leaders don’t hold their teams accountable. They pay lip service to the executives and then turn around and tell their teams to ignore that and do something different. Most of the time because they feel like each new initiative is just the flavor of the month. HR is called Business Support (or BS...insert joke here) is horribly run by someone who is a leader at another company — if you bring up this possible conflict of interest, you live in fear of being fired. Most people work to avoid having to deal with them. Each project that they launch seems to disappear never to be heard from again. There are good people there, but their leaders don’t seem to care about them or what they can actually do. Internal opportunities can take months to get responses on. I’ve seen jobs posted for over a year before being filled by someone. These aren’t highly-specialized jobs either. There is this great emerging leader program for those right out of college to learn a lot and fast track to leadership roles. Unfortunately, if you don’t come through that or are related to someone, your trajectory is significantly lower.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm
Words of Advice,1.0,"Dec 13, 2020","Well, the only pros are decent pay, remote work option (due 100% to pandemic only), and health benefits.","Let’s start with the first issue...In all the years I worked for Crown, management has always been a problem. I never felt supported by managers. They focused more on keeping their head above water or following the status quo of bullying and dismissiveness than actually being true leaders. A true sign of poor management from the top down. Second, and by far the most important, serious lack of racial diversity and inclusion at PM, management, and director levels. To think diversity is reflective of people at the bottom of the food chain is short sided and a ridiculous response to a valid question asked year after year of what Crown plans to do about its diversity issues. It’s difficult to want to work hard for a company where you don’t see yourself represented. It reminds you that no matter how hard you work, you’ll never get ahead. Donating money to an organization doesn’t exempt you from the lack of development in your own backyard. It’s a lazy effort to throw money at something you’re complicit in every day. Third, constant re-organization used as a corporate tactic of laying off employees to add “shareholder value”. Typical corporate rhetoric that completely alienates the employees who are the only reason your company HAS value.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Everyone in the department wants to transfer to another department. She was extremely condescending, disrespectful and hostile towards her employees. She went as far as forbidden me to ask other team members questions and only her. Whenever I asked for help, she wouldn't help me and instead berated straight into the ground! I knew I wouldn't last long and would be fired. The only positive is now, I no longer have to fear going into work and dealing with that cynical lady. The company hires a lot of Temps.

No Room for Growth,1.0,"Apr 2, 2015","The company has a laid back working environment. Everyone seems friendly and helpful, but only when it comes to work.

If you do not like talking than this would be a company for you. Besides that the best part about this company is the free snacks in the break room.",The downside is the office is split into two sides. They separate the majority of the contractors on one side and the full time workers on the other side. This gives a bad vibe in the office and it is definitely something you can feel. The workers seem to have their own groups that they all hang out with on a regular. It is pretty difficult to really make yourself feel part of the company when these groups don't really welcome you. The room for growth here is close to none. If there is a job available it is already taken by somebody that the hiring manger has discussed with prior to the job being posted. The business is pretty much stagnant and I wouldn't be surprised if it were the same at any other telecom company. Funny because for a communications company this office does not talk at all.

Once a great company to work for but has since lost its way.,2.0,"Sep 17, 2022",Company use to have a great culture.,"First 2 years was the best company that I had ever worked for. Things started to change when they got too ambitious and starting buying out several other companies in a short period of time. It wasn't a bad aspiration but doing so in such a short timeframe made them overextend themselves and made shareholders publicly question company leadership and philosophy. By my fifth year they had to cut spending by 20% while still producing and making $. So logically the cut from operations which doesn't technically make money (we just keep things running to allow money to be made). So in 2020, a week before Thanksgiving, Crown Castle laid off about 450 employees (nationwide) in one day. I'm sure that looked great for the 1st quarter of 2021 but eventually networks need maintenance & repairs. About 2 years leading up to that point the culture started to change from interdepartmental teamwork, assuming good intent and celebrating completion of common goals, to a typical scapegoating, everyman for himself culture. It's been a few years since I worked there, so things may have improved but beware.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Contractors with Crown Castle are an obvious second class citizen. Crown will have entire cookouts, and employee functions, and expect the temps to sit inside at their ""desk"" (we'll get to this...) while the regular employees go out and have a nice time. This company employs about 60% of their workforce as temps, AKA cheap labor. I would not expect to be hired on here full-time, no matter what your staffing agency tells you. Even if there is an opening in your department, the managers will not hire you. You may not even sit with your ""team."" While the rest of your team who are full time have nice new cubicles, the temps are stuffed onto a windowsill with no drawers. The temps may be all the way across the floor (or on another floor) from the rest of their team. Your manager may assign you a quota one day, and then chastise you for not making that quota the exact next day. For a company that prides itself on culture, the culture here is SERIOUSLY lacking.

I did love this company.,3.0,"Aug 16, 2019","Excellent benefits, good people as your peers, and a field that’s not going away any time soon, extremely down to earth CEO.","When I started at Crown I thought it was the best place in the world to work. It pains me to write this review now saying that it no longer is because I love our purpose and the potential for the business. Unfortunately the culture here has plummeted. A lot of people seem to be blaming this on our growth and the acquisition of other companies. I don’t think that is fair to the business we’ve acquired. The tower business (where I work) is what it’s always been, yet our culture has tanked too. If I had to guess I’d say that our problem is demand. The demand for our assets and services continues to grow, but because we’ve spent so much money investing in our future growth (small cells and fiber) we’ve failed to provide support to the teams that already existed. Everyone is stretched extremely thin and that has skyrocketed the tension amongst individual contributors. We’re all drowning in work and help doesn’t seem to be on the way. In addition to this the “fun” aspects of the job are disappearing. We no longer do the team building and all hands events that used to build our spirit. Not that those things would reduce the stress of our work; but I did think they were great motivators that connected IC’s to management and gave us purpose. I also think there is too much innovation for the sake of innovation right now. Departments like Real Estate are constantly being reshuffled despite the fact that things seemed to be working. If it’s not broken why fix it? During once recent shakeup several employees who were great at their jobs and well connected to their local markets got their jobs changed with zero consultation. I understand the need to constantly improve. But it doesn’t make sense to take people who were supporting their local districts and redirect their efforts to districts they don’t sit in. I fear we’re creating an a system that will be extremely distant for our landlords and make them feel like we’re just a call center that they have to beg for attention.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm
Project Manager,3.0,"Aug 29, 2017",Great benefits and vacation.,"Crown Castle as a whole is a solid organization, however the east area and more specifically the Richmond office is severely lacking in leadership and tends to adopt gimmick leadership tactics and catch phrase communication to compensate for basic common sense management. You are expected to drink their kool-aid and if you don't you will be shunned at first and then ultimately banished from the kingdom. You are told to challenge the status-quo, but when you do you are blacklisted. Nothing but hypocrisy in that office.

So happy to be here,5.0,"Sep 17, 2019","I came from a company that was truly toxic, where the management team were bullies and did not care about their employees. Where people worked long hours, had no work/life balance, were micromanaged and constantly felt that their manager or executive team was out to get them. Crown Castle is the COMPLETE opposite of it. The executive management team at Crown CARES about what is going on at the individual level. One example of this and how they take time out every 3 months to take questions from the employees (ranging from technical questions to benefits to even asking for school debt repayment) and address them as fast as they can. Trust me, Crown is not how some of these comments describe it to be. The company has grown a lot and of course there are some growing pains that come along. The company is on track to only improve and get better. I believe that some of these negative comments are stemming from people who don't adapt to change well and instantly blame the entire company for their frustration when perhaps it could be resolved by discussing with their manager /director etc. or by taking a step of action to resolve the issue at hand. Crown is amazing. Our CEO is so down to earth and truly cares about IC. The company has invested lots of money in technology and development opportunities so that people can work more efficiently and grow in their careers.

Literally, wolves in sheep clothing. They talk about growth all the time but do not allow movement upwards. They bring in competitors employees and promote them to higher positions. It’s disappointing because majority people have been in the same position for over 10 years and have not had the chance to move upwards. The company is a very relaxed company to work for and the work is simple, but the management causes you to want to leave or move over to other departments hoping it’ll be different. They never hold people accountable for their actions and allow people who don’t care or understand how to do their job to stay or be promoted. However, people who have excelled are forced to stay in their same position for years. It is true what they say it’s about who you know not what you know. This company is the true definition of that.

There has been a troubling trend over the last couple of years of ""quietly"" getting rid of any employees that are over 40 through a ""early retirement"" program.

Not sure how the people running HR received their jobs (just kidding-all politically connected in Houston) in light of their clear ignorance of the law.

Management is lacking in the East,2.0,"May 8, 2018","The people that work with you on a day to day basis. They were the reason I stayed as long as I did. PMs, CMs, RESs, Sales’, TSAs, and management in assets is solid. Asset Managers and the director of assets in the East are not only true leaders but they are also good people that care about their direct reports. Real Estate Acquistion (REA) is also a great place to work, you will never work in the East area again as the East operates in a vacuum from the rest of Crown and you are considered a “traitor” if you go work for another area or REA. Not to discourage you from taking that role, if you are lucky enough to get into REA that is based out of Houston grab that position and never let go.","The rest of the departments once you get over a level 6 the talent is truly lacking. Some of the directors, one in particular is one of the most oppressive human beings I have encountered. He belittled and mocked employees as a “joke” on a regular basis. I am not sure how promotions of people like that are continuing and I can only assume that it is coming from the top in the area. He is not the only one though, it would be quicker to list the director deserving of her position who is both fair and respectful with her employees. Though there is only so much she can do when surrounded by unethical peers. Employees are terrified to speak out. Surveys are given but no one believes them to be anonymous. Dishonesty on the surveys is the only option as many believe they will be fired if they speak out. I would like to mirror the review that stated that the management particularly in the East needs to be re-evaluated, Crown lost so many good employees because they have lazy and unethical management running rampant. When upper management has nicknames like the Queen of Hearts, Hitler, and Mussolini there is a real problem. Any company should be embarrassed and horrified at those comparisons of just one in upper management, but three, it is shameful.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Disappointed,2.0,"Apr 30, 2019",Healthcare Benefits and 401 (K),"Leadership promotes “being real” and transparent but they really are not. Company conversation answers are pretty vague in my opinion. For example someone asked Jay if it was true about the rumors of a new office building. He flat out said no but if there was he would let us know. A few months later there was an announcement about it. I feel like Jay could have said it’s something they are looking into but decisions have not been finalized. It’s hard to trust what they say is real or political answers. Mid level managers get there by befriending higher leadership personnel although they lack leadership qualities. No mentoring or care for direct reports. Crown says it’s proud of its culture but it’s like a sinking ship. Sadly no diversity! If anything there will be teams of all whites and one minority’s race just to say “we are diverse”. When asked about diversity Jay said Laura Nichol makes their executive team diverse (all white males with one white female.) Pay is not transparent. Employees are slowly finding out the compensation, bonus and PTO varies even though same position and work load are the same. Makes us feel unappreciated and cheated. No flexibility. Crown Castle does not trust employees to work from home at least once a week. Only certain people of course can work from home some days of the week, week of holidays, leave home early on Friday’s, etc. Exempts get away with not using PTO until it’s the end of year and use it all during holidays. Christmas Eve is not a holiday. Does not allow me to spend time with my family who IS off during this holiday. I was told to utilize my PTO although I am at the lowest rate of PTO and have to ration my time off during the year for personal sick days, daughters sick days, family vacations. Religious holidays, etc. While others with less experience are accruing at the max rate and like I mentioned before can get away with not tracking PTO properly.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm
No longer the best company,2.0,"May 10, 2019","Benefits are ok, PTO is great, and they pay well.","Crown Castle used to care about their employees, you used to get promoted based off of what you know and how hard you work rather than who you know. Seniored employees are opting to retire early or leave because as long as you are friends with upper management or suck up to upper management, they will move you into management jobs whether you are qualified or not. I see so many qualified people that are being looked over and lied to because upper management already has someone in mind for positions that they are not qualified for. The advice to get ahead is to become friends with Directors and higher ups- MidWest Area is Well known for doing this . The company keeps taking away the reasons why people loved Crown to begin with. The bonus structure changed and not to our benefit, budget cuts makes the company no longer a work hard play hard meaning there are no rewards to your long days anymore. It used to be if you had an exceeds you would get a pay raise and be able to top out your bonus, they no longer do this and wonder why they score low on “ pay for performance” questions on the employee survey. You used to never hear of people wanting to leave or look elsewhere for employment and it’s way more common now than ever. They will not budge on working remotely although they are a telecommunications company. The office politics are just not worth it. To save money they are enforcing a do more with less structure meaning, they aren’t in a hiring freeze but you must really be struggling in order for them to backfill a position. Since they started doing this, there has been minimal movement in the company so when someone is just moved into a position without opening a job requisition, it’s noticeable.

"Such High Hopes, So Disappointed",2.0,"Jul 9, 2020","For the most part, you get to work with smart, generally amiable people - this was an enjoyable part of the company and something you will hear often, the Culture. Leaning in to a transparent framework when it comes to re-orgs & big changes so the employees feel their input is heard.","If you are at a lower-level status, your enthusiasm to succeed and find a place within the company is quickly met with false promises and deflection. There is no line drawn for the demanding workload or expectations as a contractor (such as training formal employees), but once you seek answers or feedback upper management will quickly remind you of your place. There is less of a focus on the work being produced as a top performer, rather your final outcome of advancement is more of a crapshoot of timing and what department you are in. There is proven record of even the most deserving of contracted employees being terminated while the ""lucky ones"" get to move forward in the employment process. It is well versed by the veteran employees that this is a sad, unreasonable trend that has risen over recent years. Another problem at Crown Castle is that how well you do is more of a matter of perception than the actual work you produce. Even if you're often identified as a good performer -- if you aren't vocal and toot your own horn to management, you are unlikely to advance quickly. You have to be your own advocate, which can be true in most work environments, but for the people who are more interested in focusing on the actual work and demonstrating their value that way, there isn't time partiality. Standards aren't uniformly enforced either. In fact, you will likely spend much of your time learning the daily work and systems on your own. Whether your team is helpful and/or encouraging is a big component of how well you do rather than the company providing the necessary tools and resources to succeed.

Scheduling and hours are flexible for interns, contractors, and employees. I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects in the legal department - from lobbying to corporate compliance, to SEC filings and proxy statements. I have been treated with respect and people have gone out of their way to be nice and helpful. Employees and supervisors have been a great help with job-seeking. I would 100% stay if something were to open up. Research projects and other substantive work can be highly rewarding. Legal interns can expect to work on high profile projects from time to time. No one is hanging over your shoulder to get things done - it is evident that they trust their people and that mentality comes from the top.","Interns, while treated well, are not seen as future employees and very little efforts are made to employ them after graduation (for undergraduates) or the bar exam (for law students). Pay is not competitive ($18.50 for legal interns. $13 for regular interns) for similar jobs and is incongruous with the GPA requirements they demand, particularly when there is no job at the end. Work can on occasion be administrative minutiae because of the sheer volume of matters the legal department has to deal with, but I suppose this is a fact of life.

Program Manager,5.0,"Aug 27, 2019","Culture, Opportunity for Growth, Customer Relationships, Leadership Team, Compensation and Benefits... This is a great company with many great leaders who truly care about their staff. Yes, we have grown and yes our culture has adapted and evolved through that growth. We had to adapt and grow to survive. This is especially true for publicly traded companies in a fiercely competitive sector like our own. Those who would wish to retain unnecessary and lavish meetings and over staffed teams should consider this would eventually lead to mass lay offs as it was unsustainable. I applaud the EMT for making the tough decisions and ensuring we evolve to meet our growth commitments. As a tenured employee who has worked hard to grow my career at Crown Castle, I genuinely thank Jay and the team.","I love this company but like any company there are areas improvement: I do wish we were more progressive about remote working flexibility. The policy was just updated and it was disappointing to not see more progression here. Allowing people more flexibility here (maybe a day or two a week at max) would increase moral and alleviate stress both at work and at home. Also, I was disappointed in the way the AI was changed. Not necessarily in the alignment towards company goals with shareholder experience. But, more with the fact that a cap was put on the AI. If we are aligning to our shareholder experience, why cap the AI? Our shareholders do not have caps! Let’s dream bigger. This may also increase motivation of the staff! Lastly, it wasn’t cool to adjust the managers AI calculations after the year had already been completed. This did not align with our Be Real B3.

Crown used to be centered around it's B3 values but now the key phrase is ""Shareholder Value"". It's all the leadership cares about. Employees to cut or ignore are just a statistic and nothing else.

Fantastic Executives - Some Poor Middle Management,5.0,"Nov 29, 2020","There are a few companies with better executive management than Crown Castle. The culture in general is fantastic and the benefits are second to none. It’s fantastic working for executives that don’t say one thing and preach constantly one thing and then act another way. That’s very unique and refreshing. They truly live by what they preach. Unfortunately their constant preaching of good culture doesn’t always seem to soak in for some management throughout the company. While the senior executives truly mean what they say as far as good culture is concerned, I wonder if some high/middle-management treat these ideas as mere internal marketing slogan’s but don’t truly live it themselves. This seems more true in regions further away from the headquarters in Houston. If you can work at Crown Castle in Houston you will be very fortunate. Fantastic individuals and lots of great memories of working there in Houston. I know I mixed in some cons here.","It’s hard to come up with these as it feels that executive management is absolutely intent on making it a great place to work and are doing everything in their power to make it so. I remember when the executives found out about one high-level manager who was clearly out of step with the good Crown culture (unbelievable ego and his disrespect of others lower than him was ridiculous) and got rid of him immediately as fast as they could. It’s fantastic. And it sent the signal that they protect no one whose behavior is bad. I absolutely loved it. if only they could find all of the managers whose words actions and egos don’t always align with the culture that’s being preached. I’ve met middle/high-level managers in other regions that seem to have bigger egos than the entire executive management team put together (which, ironically don’t seem to have any ego at all). I remember one director getting rid of one of the hardest working, kindest individuals I’ve ever worked with. The employee was super helpful even when he really didn’t have time to be (as was evidenced by his constantly working weekends). He was promoted, then afterward, told the director he was having qualms about his own ability to do the job. Instead of giving his old job back (which he was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AT), he was immediately fired. Unreal ego trip. NOT A SINGLE EXECUTIVE WOULD HAVE CONDONED THAT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIFIED OF LEARNING OF SUCH TERRIBLE TREATMENT OF SUCH A KIND, helpful, high-performing individual). He was an encyclopedia of knowledge about his job and trained several others.

SEEKING OTHER CROWN EMPLOYEES AGAINST THE VACCINE MANDATE,1.0,"Oct 20, 2021",The salary is fair and the benefit package is good.,"President Biden has not issued a national mandate because the federal government has no statutory authority to do so, but Crown Castle (headquartered in TX) is strictly enforcing vaccine mandates for ALL employees, with NO exceptions. Crown Castle has refused to comply with the TX Governor's Executive Order banning vaccine mandates. All employees must submit proof of full vaccination by November 15th or be terminated and then ineligible to receive unemployment benefits. I am not against the vaccine. I have already had COVID-19 and I have natural immunity; recent research has proven that antibodies are more protective than the vaccine. The CDC confirms the vaccine will not prevent me from contracting COVID or spreading it, and the efficacy of the vaccines continues to decline. I am extremely concerned about the number of deaths and adverse events related to the mRNA vaccinations. What if I comply with Crown’s mandate and suffer cardiac issues or become disabled – what then? I also have strong personal religious convictions that leave me very conflicted about the mRNA vaccines, but Crown will not honor religious exemptions. Crown even refuses to allow any reasonable accommodations, like accepting my antibody test results, allowing me to submit regular COVID tests or to continue to work from home. I never anticipated having to face such a personal moral and ethical dilemma in my workplace. My employer is forcing me to undergo an irreversible and experimental medical treatment to feed my family and keep a roof over my head -- or destroy my life. Isn’t this a violation of my civil rights? I support a family and cannot afford to lose my job. I would like to connect with other employees who are experiencing the same relentless pressure to ""hurry up and get the shot"" and suffering the same immense stress my family and I are facing as we try to decide the best way forward.

I have never seen a company where they promote this type of horrid behavior. The current managers are not qualified for their jobs and have been placed in that position by their buddies or by being brainwashed into being a corporate bully. Each manager gets a ""dirty deed"" to do as initiation into the group I assume. The current East Area Leadership team has their own agendas and push good hard working people out of this company by treating them horribly, telling them they are not worthy of their hard earned degrees, and finding ways to write them up to aid in kicking them out the door. Some members of the leadership team, 1 in particular, has been quoted of saying ""if you don't want someone working here anymore, then you make them so miserable they quit."" From the reviews on this page and by peers who have left willingly and those who have been forced out, it should be evident that this company and its leadership are terrible.

You have promoted people that you were friends with (with little or no experience or qualifications other than they were your friend) some of these people do not have high school diplomas and are managing large district and area teams of highly skilled individuals with master's degrees and doctoral degrees. These middle managers are hiding behind their desks and pretending that they know what is going on. They are micro-managing teams on items like time cards (yes that got implemented hot and heavy in late 2018!) and quantifying data output because they do not know what their teams do - but they know the right people to be put into a management role.

Wearing a scarlet letter,1.0,"Sep 3, 2016",Some of the most outwardly nice people I've known to work with. Clean office. Plenty of leftovers to pick through once all of the real employees get to eat.,"I worked here as a contractor. Anyone who has worked here will likely immediately know what I'm about to start talking about, due to how prevalent the issues are. When I first started at crown castle, as a contractor, the stock price was around $76. Now it is around $96. My purpose of stating this is not to take credit for their performance. It is to illustrate that is a company doing very well financially. Their net profit margin this year is nearly 9%. I could list more metrics, but let me save you the time and tell you that they are very good. Because of this, or maybe despite this, they have very good benefits for their REGULAR employees. For example, I overheard my colleagues complaining about having a deductible on their insurance this year. Departments have a yearly trip that they take where they spend a week elsewhere in the country and have work parties. The group I was associated with had one such week long party where the rooms at this place ran over $300 a night. They have fairly regular employer paid lunches. Generous holidays. Go look at their benefits yourself, you will be impressed. I was, anyway. However, since I was a contractor, I got none of them. No paid time off. No sick time. No holidays. When the regulars get an early day, what do the contractors get? They can leave if they want, but they have to make the time up. What if the office is flooded for two days and the contractors are explicitly told not to come to work, what happens? They don't get paid. What about the smaller stuff? Well, when the regulars get lunch, the contractors are told they have to eat AFTER everyone else. I've never in my life had anyone tell me anything like that. When they have their little non yearly office parties, the contractors get told that they can't attend. Monthly morning tea? Sorry. So, one might think then that it's all the more motivation to become a regular employee for this company with its great benefits. That may work for some. But in my experience and that of others, there are opportunites only for some. Consider a scenario--two employees start at the same time. One a young man, one a young woman. How weird would be if all of these 40+ year old managers introduced themselves to one and ignored the other? That's what happened to me. The managers were male the new employee was a female. These entry level jobs that contractors could aspire to, they're either set aside for nepotism or set aside for a particular gender. I was always told that nepotism was bad, but until I sat and heard a woman talking about how her husband directly got her brother a job, I didn't have cause to believe it. The way some landlord customers are treated are pretty abhorrent, too. I won't get into that, though.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

The health benefits were great, compensation could be good depending on your role and team.","Leadership- There are some good managers to be found throughout the organization and you can sniff them out pretty easily, but overall there is a void of leadership within Crown Castle. It is evident that the sub-par leadership is not confined to one area, team, or group. It is an issue across the organization. Read the reviews on this site, they are more honest than the employee survey. It is also not surprising to see the leadership attempt to cover up the negative reviews with the positive ones. Communication- Leadership at Crown Castle SAYS the right things (or says nothing at all), but it is in their actions, or lack thereof, where you see the truth. The B3’s are talked up from management, but the actions behind them are lacking. Growth/Advancement- this is a “Who you know” culture. I personally have seen multiple roles filled by people with limited background for said role, while those with a proven track record of success are passed over for irrelevant reasons. Diversity- there isn’t much. Training- It is a sink or swim environment…or maybe float in a group with people that can help keep your head above water, hoping someone in a leadership role does not push you under. Culture – I sought out Crown Castle as a place to work when I started there. It was known as a great place to work and have a career. Somewhere you wanted to be. At this point the line to get out is longer than the line to get in. Many people have begun to leave, or left, and leadership will say it is because they “are not on board with change” . Many of these people (of which I am one) are more comfortable changing their entire employment than staying in an environment and culture that has become increasingly toxic and stressful. They are fine with change, it is poor leadership, lack of vision, and lack of support that they were looking to leave.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Crown Castle is an enjoyable place to work if you're not looking to move up.,4.0,"Nov 5, 2013",The company is very stable and the environment does encourage a very good work/life balance. Off-site meeting locations were great.,"Lack of opporunities to move up in the company. Favoritism was an issue.

Poisonous & Toxic Culture with Decent Pay,1.0,"Aug 9, 2022","Generous benefits package, great healthcare, with lucrative RSU program.","Completely visionless leadership driven by unqualified and out of touch EMT and SLT. Priorities are constantly shifting and decisions are made poorly based on politics and egos. SLT reorgs every 2 years, with the same favored- yet incompetent- VPs and Directors and somehow expects different results. (2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022) Digital Transformation is failing. Operational improvements are never fully thought through or executed on because no one really wants to change how they do business and senior leadership cannot make rational decisions or prioritize. Senior leaders are rarely held accountable for their inadequacies. There are some exceptionally poisonous VPs in key improvement roles who are ruining the culture and progress for entire teams. Crown Castle is not a happy work place and morale has been steadily declining for years. Crown has become so toxic and unsatisfying to work at that tenured employees are leaving in droves, leaving behind the golden handcuffs in unvested RSU stocks and bonuses. It's not worth staying in such toxic environment to feel undervalued as a human and made ineffective because VP leadership just spins in circles and has for years.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm

Midwest,1.0,"May 2, 2019",This used to be a great company.,"Too much focus on customers and not employees.

It Feels Like No One is at the Helm,1.0,"Jun 22, 2021",They offer good benefits for health insurance,"High stress. So much talk from leadership but no one believes it anymore. I was always proud to go to events and represent the company everyone wanted to work for. The culture was great and I felt like I really mattered and what I did made an impact... Not anymore. Last year, our company laid off so many people. The knowledge that left our company with that layoff is still felt as people scramble to fill in the massive craters left in that layoff's wake. The psychological ripple affect has left so many of us wary of Crown's leadership. To say it has been a nightmare wouldn't even begin to describe it. The workloads on those of us left has more than doubled and we're told this is the norm now. On top of the additional workloads, KPIs have been tightened. Management continues to glaze over the fact we can't maintain this. In my department alone, we've had an unprecedented amount of people ""abandon ship"". There are openings for their replacements but no one is applying. It's really sad to see this company go from what it used to be to what it is now. I too am looking outside of this company because I'm tired of bailing water that's pooling faster than I can bail. I can honestly say I wouldn't recommend applying here under the current regime. Its clear the people who have helped carry this company don't matter to the current leadership...",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm
Even Apartheid States are Full of Nice People,1.0,"Oct 14, 2021",Snacks in the break room. People are nice.,"Nice people are part of the problem. Because too many of CC’s full time employees go with the flow CC gets away with a lot of mistreatment. Ultimately CC operates with a high contractor headcount, makes it difficult for contractors to transition to full time and makes it difficult for full time employees to get promoted to avoid paying benefits for many of its employees and avoid significant raises. Contractors are hired with the promise of a full time job within 3 months of hire but doesn’t disclose that in order to convert to full time, the contract employee will have to wait for an opening and proceed through the application and an extensive interview process. This is true even if the contractor is applying for their own job. An existing internal employee applying from within the office or from another office and family members of existing employees will receive preference over the contract employee even if the contract employee is applying for the job they are already doing as a contractor. Some people have been “contractors” for 10 years. If you move jobs bc your spouse got a job in another city, you may have to accept a contractor role and CC will drop you from benefits. When I was working for CC about 45% of the workforce was contract. They notified all of the contractors with about 5 working days warning that as of the following Friday all contractors would be let go company-wide. Contractors are treated as second class citizens by management. They are required to stay and continue working while full time employees leave for the company Christmas party and other company events. How awkward to watch everyone get up and walk out to go to a holiday party while murmuring apologies to the contractors as you pass. Existing full time employees have to go through the same process to get promoted.l that contractors have to go through to get hired. Managers do not advocate for their employees to be promoted even within their own group because, just like everyone else, employees at Crown are just coasting through for a paycheck and no one wants to call attention to themselves. Some full time employees are given annual bonuses while for others it is left to the discretion of their manager to give them a piece of his pie. Even if the bonus is based upon a project that you worked on, you will likely not receive a bonus unless you are management and the manager’s primary role is to “assign” work. CC attempted a leadership development program. The education includes teaching managers to teach their people that high performers often don’t take vacation days. The false statistic referenced is one of many false statistics CC uses to employee a workaholic culture. The executives primarily tour from office to office like the English royal family visiting their colonies. On those days you will receive a free lunch in exchange for a healthy dose of culture propoganda. I’m not sure what else they do.",Crown Castle Inc.,CCI,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Crown-Castle-Reviews-E8416.htm
