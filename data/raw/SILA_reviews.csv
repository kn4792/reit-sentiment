Great Company,5.0,"Dec 3, 2021",Love the work flex plan. Great working environment and the company really cares about the employees and their opinions.,"None I can think of, other than the commute when I do have to go to the office.","Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
Not the best place to work,1.0,"Jun 16, 2023",Free food is often given in the office. Free tickets to Amelie arena concerts (If you are lucky),"This company used to be an amazing, positive company to work for. I hate to say that is not the case anymore. The C-suite does not seem to care about the employees and what makes employees happy. Most employees are disgruntled and although the company likes to say that they have an open door policy, if anyone does speak up it's usually not long before that employee is no longer working at the company. The company has been trying to get the best places to work award yet, they have failed and there is a reason why employees aren't voting in favor of this. The culture has gotten toxic and you only get recognize if you are a favorite of the c-suite team. Overall, management has alot of work to do. Alot of training is needed for the managers and definitely more accountability for the managers.","Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
STAY AWAY,1.0,"Sep 10, 2023","Used to be great Used to have many, not anymore!",CEO and CFO only care about themselves and their possible payout IF they get the company on the exchange!! They let loyal people go and LIE about the reason why!! STAY AWAY!!!!!,"Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
"Overall, Great place to work",5.0,"Sep 3, 2019",- Team atmosphere -Open Door policy -Fun work environment. The employee social events are great and the weekly fitness option is an amazing benefit. -The Executive team really does care and work hard to make this a good place to work -Great benefits. They have always been great but somehow they continue to get better,-Commute sucks (But that's beyond their control) -Some managers need proper training to learn how to manage other people effectively. You cannot manage everyone the same as everyone is different.,"Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
Excellent team with leadership that embraces progress,5.0,"Aug 23, 2019","Open door policy with leadership is actually practical here. The executive team listens to ideas and often implements them when feasible. I've had three titles on two different teams here and I've always been trusted to operate autonomously, but I always have access to expert guidance when needed. Company events are always a good time with management expressing a genuine interest in employees enjoying themselves.",Nothing sticks out as a negative.,"Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
DO NOT WORK HERE,1.0,"Aug 1, 2022",There are no pros anymore.,"This company used to be great. They offered good benefits, listened to their employees, and offered a welcoming, supportive team environment. That has all gone out the window in the last year. Corporate has lost all sight of what makes a good company in the pursuit of status and clout. Gone is fair pay, gone are good, hard working managers and leaders. The CEO and CFO are gutting the company of its most loyal employees in favor of people who look good on a 10-Q. This company will not continue to be a best place to work in Tampa Bay. They do not care about their employees anymore and fail to see why the choices they’re making will be their demise. Steer clear!!","Sila Realty Trust, Inc.",SILA,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sila-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1609517.htm
