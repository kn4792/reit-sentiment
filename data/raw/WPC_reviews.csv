Room for improvement,2.0,"Mar 11, 2015",Mid & lower level employees generally nice and nice to work with. Benefits are decent (although not as good as they used to be). Exposure to interesting real estate transactions world-wide. The CEO still seems to very much care about the employees and has genuine interest in the company & the morale of all.,"Expectations are unrealistic, and the extremely poor planning of a new system implementation project has made employees very stressed and extremely burned out. New management brought in over the past few years has implemented changes in culture & general work environment that create a hostile and dissatisfied work place. The general mentality is that most upper management (not including aforementioned CEO) does not care about its mid to lower level employees, with continual empty promises that ""it'll get better"" while there is no indication that it will for the foreseeable future.",W.

Bill Carey's legacy of dedication to investors,5.0,"Oct 12, 2017","Best experience of my career! I was very honored to have been a part of Bill Carey's legacy. His value system, which focused on putting the investors first, permeated the organization. He was right, if you focus on what is good for the investor, everything else falls into place. This philosophy combined with smart, humble talent has contributed to an unparalleled track record over 40 years and 15 funds that have gone full cycle. I was honored to work alongside some of the best people I have known in the investment industry.",Business model is shifting and long term plan is unclear but I have no doubt this will remain a profitable and strong business.,W.

Going off the rails,1.0,"Sep 29, 2017","Amazing benefits, the last bastion of the prominent founder and thought leader William Polk Carey who sadly passed away about five years ago.","Glad I got out when I did. Management has regressed recently into a few people who have been there for far too many years, becoming more corrupt, incestuous and small minded by the minute. Expect another round of layoffs soon as the business model is anachronistic for a public company expected to keep its expenses under control, and there is no longer creativity or innovation in management's approach to industry challenges. Benefits are great but the compensation is subpar for many (although the ""lifers"" who grew up there and in many cases could not get jobs elsewhere if they tried - think Chief Marketing Officer who is also stunningly the head of HR although her group has the highest turnover of any in the company - still enjoy the kind of comp from the days of a private business taking 10% off the top of every investment). Over my tenure there I was unfortunate enough to witness the deterioration of a great company from the inside out.",W. P.

A place you can call home,5.0,"Dec 13, 2018","I’ve been with the company for over a decade. I’m proud to spend the bulk of my day with some of the hardest working people in the industry. People that I not only see as colleagues but as long term friends. This firm not only challenges you to think outside the box, but values what input you may bring to the table. The sense of community continues to bring me back to work each day, and I appreciate the value they see in every employee.

Company is going downhill. Still performing well but employees are demotivated and unhappy.,2.0,"May 25, 2014","Good benefits, work is interesting. Company is a leader in its industry and employees feel proud about that. New systems being put in place should ultimately have a positive result on workload and processes.",Management is completely disconnected with the rest of its employees. New management that has been brought in over the last few years is trying to redefine the company and its culture. No value for the long history of success. Ridiculous expectations being set in accounting and IS departments.,W. P. Carey Inc.,WPC,Diversified,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/W-P-Carey-Reviews-E7682.htm
Poor Poor Management,1.0,"Nov 16, 2017",Some of the hardest and smartest working people on the lower tiers. Great personalities and great sense of camaraderie for all the low level employees.,"Upper and middle management is horrendous. As other reviewers have mentioned, the longest tenured employees are the most corrupt and incestuous. How does it make any sense to promote long tenured UNQUALIFIED people to high positions? The HR department is a joke. Turnover on all fronts should be saying something. Let’s count how many CEO and CFO changes they’ve had in 5 years. Keep that stock price up tho!",W. P.

Contributes to the community through their Carey Forward initiative. Not as high stress as most Wall Street finance firms.","Bonuses and base pay on the lower side.

The company has gone down hill,1.0,"Oct 25, 2017","I am still friends with some of the people I worked with, but that's it.","1) You don't get paid what is promised. 2) They do not like creativity. They would rather you stick to the books. 3) They preach about family and values, but they have none. 4) Awful management- they have no idea what they are doing. 5) Management has 0 loyalty. 6) Making their employees happy is a very low priority. They only care about the upper management. 7) In two years there were two instances of mass layoffs.",W. P.

Culture Changed,2.0,"May 2, 2016",Friendly staff Decent benefits (while they're still around),"Benefits are being taken away piecemeal.

Okay salary for an entry level back office,2.0,"Nov 16, 2018",Salary is okay for entry level back office position with little responsibilities. Christmas bonuses are generous. Good collective health care and pension scheme. There are some nice people with whom you can get along (and bond over your complaints).,"No communication between departments, no cooperation or team spirit. No proactivity, non-efficient procedures. Ineffective IT technology, slow computers and system with legacy issues, old school culture. No flexibility to work from home/shift lunch hours. Travel costs are only partially covered (others with older contracts have no travel reimbursement at all), parking fee is not covered (all Dutch companies fully cover all these). Favouritism in the office and by HR. Efforts aren't appreciated, management doesn't want associates to develop their knowledge, so that they won't become stronger on the job market, hence less likely to leave. Still incredibly high turnover as employees are unhappy and do regular unpaid overtime. If you voice your concern or unsatisfaction, let alone criticise management or say that you want to move to a higher role, they will drive you to leave the company.

Highly turnover rate as a consequence because we are in Holland and nobody can keep that peace at zero overtime remuneration (unless you're Asian or a foreign worker that requires a sponsorship working permit ) expect to be yelled by management, expect to be told off for arriving to work later than 9 am (even though you worked long hours the previous day) accept a job there if you want to work in the weekend during quarter closes and have no life during those periods. They'll buy you a drink right after and promise that'll never ever happen again, that they're working hard on that, wait up until next quarter.",W. P.

Struggling with management at all levels,2.0,"Feb 8, 2017",-Work is challenging and engaging much of the time. -Promotions are possible -Great colleagues during my time,"Current upper management has no concern for employees, only AFFO metrics. As a result of this there have been recent layoffs and salary freezes. This is a part of business but in a company that demands so much from its employees both in technical expertise and overtime worked this kind of treatment is a motivation killer. Middle management too busy worrying about careers to support employees under them as much of the experienced middle management was let go in 2016. Complexity of current systems are overwhelming, a combination of legacy system problems being carried over and bad decision making has left many of the processes overly complex and difficult to use.",W.
