Would never recommend Centerspace to anyone - Run!,1.0,"Oct 21, 2025",Volunteer time off and holidays were paid.,"The culture is driven by micromanagement and fear. Favoritism and bullying are common, creating a toxic and unsupportive environment where employees feel undervalued and unsafe to speak up. Would never recommend Centerspace to anyone.

Better Every Days,5.0,"May 27, 2025","Starting a new job can be a little nerve-wracking, but my experience with Centerspace has been nothing short of incredible. From day one, I've felt supported, valued, and genuinely welcomed. One of the biggest pros has been the flexibility in working style—there’s a strong sense of trust here, and you’re encouraged to work in a way that brings out your best. What truly sets this company apart is its leadership team. They're not only accessible but also incredibly open to new ideas and different ways of doing things. It’s refreshing to be part of an organization where innovation is encouraged and your voice matters. You’re empowered to think boldly and “Dare to Win”—an approach that creates a dynamic and energizing work environment. I’ve also had the chance to challenge myself and grow in ways that are both exciting and rewarding. The work is engaging, and I’ve already learned so much in just a short time. On top of that, my co-workers have been amazing—friendly, genuine, and eager to build connections. There’s a shared commitment to getting “Better Every Days,” and that mindset shows up in both individual efforts and team collaboration. The culture is warm and welcoming, and that starts from the top. Even our CEO, Anne, took the time to personally reach out to see how my first few weeks were going. It’s clear that people come first here. The leadership team checks in regularly and truly wants to hear from us—not just in group settings but on a personal level too. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful to be part of such a thoughtful, forward-thinking company. It’s a place where people and progress go hand in hand, and where we’re all encouraged to grow, innovate, and make every day better.","As with any new role, there’s always a learning curve—and for me, the most significant one has been getting up to speed with the technology platforms used at Centerspace. While each system has its strengths, I’ve noticed that not all platforms fully integrate with one another, which can lead to some manual work to ensure consistency and alignment across different tools. This has been a great opportunity for me to better understand the current processes, and I appreciate the transparency and support from my team as I’ve navigated through it. At the same time, I see a real opportunity for process improvement, particularly in exploring how AI could be leveraged at a system level to streamline workflows, reduce manual tasks, and improve overall efficiency. I’m excited to see how technology can evolve here, and I’m confident that, given the company’s openness to innovation and continuous improvement, these enhancements are not only possible but well within reach.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Top Notch Support & Culture,5.0,"Mar 9, 2023","Great work/life balance that is respected by leaders. Benefits are tough to beat. Culturally, having worked for multiple Multi-Family Housing Companies, CenterSpace talks the talk, and walks the walk. Support is amazing & every employee I've reached out to has been happy to lend a hand whenever necessary. One of their keys, is ""One Team"", which means that although we all work at our individual properties, we're one company and we are all on the same team. It's not just a key, or a hashtag, it's actually true.","Depending on the position, days can be heavy. We deal with the 4 most important things in peoples lives: their homes, pets, cars & money. That's not necessarily a con for the company but the industry. As managers, it's not a 24-hour job in reality, but it does feel like it. Only other item would be that due to the size of the teams, staffing is sometimes difficult without enough bodies to fill in. That is where the #oneteam comes in and help is recruited from other sites.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Messy,1.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Endless funds to spend on the residents and staff, there's apparently no max to the party budget","Management doesn't care about Fair Housing or EEOC at all. There's a huge problem with fraternization. Lots of hooking up, drinking, and partying with the residents. Staff members get really cliquey with residents and are unable to impartially implement Fair Housing. One resident sexually harassed another resident at the pool, and when the victim complained, the manager said the victim was being sensitive and not understanding the perpetrator's humor (she was friends with perp). She refused to file an incident report. One teammate was regularly hooking up with a resident who was going through Eviction. It's unethical and convoluted. The exposure for a lawsuit is crazy high. It's like going back to high school in the worst way. If you don't go along with the status quo, you're told you're not a ""culture fit"" and your teammates will shun you like in The Crucible.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Bad Managers,3.0,"May 10, 2023",The benefits are unmatchable by most companies.,Upper management doesn't care about the opinions of site staff.

Industry Leader,5.0,"Feb 23, 2021","When I reflect on my time with Centerspace I can say with complete confidence that this company has helped me grow into a strong leader, mentor and really pathed my way to the successes I have experienced. They have a strong sense of their one team mantra and are adaptable to change laying the path to becoming a industry leader in property management. They took any obstacle over this last year and turned it into a learning experience, kept a positive outlook on every situation and really supported their employees through the ever changing times. I’m speaking out of first hand knowledge being at our Urban properties during COVID and the Civil Unrest in the communities my properties are in, they made the residents and employees safety and care a first priority. They made their appreciation known through listening to what we needed and what residents needed and acted on it instead of only thinking about the bottom line. The ability to work for such a excellent leadership team has shown me what working for a company should be, you should have work/life balance and time off, you should be heard and cared for and most importantly you should have the opportunity to grow and be given opportunities to show your passion, Centerspace gives you all of that and more.",There are none I can point out.,Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Unvalued employee,1.0,"Apr 10, 2018","Some positives would be the good hours, stable` pay, and the insurance. I love my residents so much and they are the only reason that I have been able to last this long in such a toxic environment.","It does not matter how hard you work, you will NEVER be recognized for it. They say they hire up within the company, however I have seen on numerous occasions, perfectly qualified, hard workers not even being considered with no good reason as to why. Corporate, upper management is completely untouchable, it does not matter what they do or how they treat people, nothing will ever change. I have seen employee turnover after turnover because of the regional manager and it doesn't seem to be looked at. It has been made very clear to everyone currently employed under them that nothing will change, and we have been told to go ahead and find a new job. IRET does NOT care about their employees in any way shape or form. They also do not offer a very high discount on rent, considering most property management companies offer free housing to employees. The pay is also considerably lower than competing properties. It has been empty promise, after promise.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Not stable,3.0,"Jul 3, 2019",The environment is good. If your full time the benefits are good too. I like that there is nothing after 6pm and nothing on sundays.,"The company is forever changing. They’ve implemented so many different things since I started. All which require online training. But they only give a week or two until something happens. You could be gone on vacation and come back and everything is different. They also claim to value costumer service, but between management being rude to residents all the time, the constant price hikes in amenities (garages going up 40% in one year), and only covering heat instead of any other utilities is obvious they are only interested in making money. Also, if you’re part time, your benefits suck. Only the discount of rent. Nothing else.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Best Job Ever!,5.0,"Feb 15, 2019","I started working for IRET last year, and I can honestly say I am working with the BEST team ever, and for one of the most positively focused companies I’ve ever seen. From the very day that I walked through the door, I have been treated with nothing but respect. I am surrounded by people who support me, believe in me, and who want me to succeed. Opportunities abound with this company, and they are always on the look out for people with a “can do” attitude. Everyone I’ve seen here works hard, and they believe in what they do, and why they do it.

Poor Manager,1.0,"Feb 4, 2013","Some good, engaged people at corporate but much apathy and laziness exists within this company","I guess I should have been more concerned during my interview when my future manager said ""one thing this company doesn't do well is train people"". I assumed she would train me but evidently she couldn't be bothered. I don't know if it is a regional problem in Billings or it is the culture throughout the company but IRET Properties does not treat its people well. My manager favored people that were lazy, tired and had no enthusiasm for their job.

Potentially a person can being working as a leasing agent or in maintenance.,"Sometimes it can be lonely as stated before but that is really a characteristic of the job in general and not a reflection of the company. I suggest getting some audio books and listening to them while you work. However, I can go through about 3 audio books a week which can make this practice expensive.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Mismanagement,1.0,"Dec 26, 2018",I will have to say that Pay is a factor to accepting a position with IRET.,"It may not be for each location, but mismanagement is a massive factor in my location. One thing is said to one employee, another is said to the next employee across the office; information essential to job performance is not given to be passed along to residents asking questions. Micro-managing is a culture practiced to full extent and there is an atmosphere of dictator, my-way-or-the-highway attitude. Training is null and I am lost in the realm of this money-hungry company. I could perform my duties much better if I had adequate training. With a lot of actions and miscommunication, there are a lot of Human Resource mal-practices going on.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
I will always recommend IRET,5.0,"Sep 10, 2020",IRET genuinely cares about their employees and their families. They took every precaution when COVID 19 had started and continues to do so. They allowed their teams to work remotely. They've made their voice clear regarding justice and equality. I am so proud to be able to work for a company that is so passionate in standing for what is right. They also even give out quarterly bonuses + even random ones. The senior team is very involved and you feel like a work family. Their training is extremely thorough and hands on. You will feel very confident jumping in after training. There is plenty of room to grow within the company and even to transfer out of state. I cannot recommend IRET enough!,You may have to work some nights or weekends. They do off set it by giving you a day off or time and a half.,Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
My year at IRET.,5.0,"Dec 8, 2017","Benefits, Pay, Corporate structure, work life balance and training are just a few of the pros that IRET has to offer. I’m approaching a 1 year anniversary with this company and am extremely satisfied with my decision of employment.",Dealing with angry tenants has its downside and in my opinion is the hardest part of the job. Some people just let the smallest thing turn into the end of the world. You have to have the right kind of temperament for this position. On a positive note the company offers training that can help you cope with this situation.,Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Dead End Job with Poor Management,2.0,"Jun 20, 2014","My coworkers are some of the best people around, but sadly are one of the only positive things about working for this company.","There is little to no room for advancement within the company. At times when more advanced positions have been open they have tended to hire outside the company rather than giving opportunity to existing staff members. Benefits have been slashed and salary is below market. Work as hard as you like, but there is little chance you will be recognized for it. Your reward will be yet more work, but with no pay increase. Executive management consists of a tight knit group of people that is holding the company back from what it could be.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Community Manager,1.0,"Jan 8, 2019",This was a really great company prior to new upper management coming in.,"The new management team controls every aspect of your day, they micromanage and clearly do not communicate with each other because they all tell you something different. You don’t have the ability to provide your own input or feedback. There is no room for growth within the company because they fill all the positions with people from outside the company that know someone. Your hard work is never recognized, no matter how dedicated you are to the company. You get little to no say in your budget, even though you are on expected to run the property. They also continually pile more work on you and don’t offer adequate staffing. Regional managers are non existent, they “work from home” and are rarely available. A lot of sketchy things happen and heads are turned the other way, no one is held accountable.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Property Management,1.0,"Mar 17, 2020",I was lucky to get out when I did.,"This is —hands down— the worst job I’ve ever had in the property management industry. I was emotionally neglected by the boss that hired me, bulldozed by my on-site management, and was publicly humiliated by the head bosses that hired me. As a queer person, I figured this was the most progressive company I could work for in the area. I never anticipated that not only would I be shunned, but publicly humiliated by the team that hired me after I turned in my notice. I would hire an attorney if I had the time and energy to fight the lawsuit. Turns out? I wasn’t the only one with bad experience. There’s a clear pattern.

I really enjoy working for IRET because I feel supported by my manager and know that she not only cares about me as an employee, but also a person.","This is a tough one to answer because the company has made so many significant strides in the last few years.

PTO is decent (14 days I believe), plus 8 or 9 paid holidays.","Toxic work environment. Upper management doesn't care what feedback they get from site teams. If you say anything negative you ""don't believe in the product"". They don't trust site teams to do what needs to be done so they gatekeep everything and prolong any necessary process. Only cares about the money and bottom line. While that's important, customer relations needs to be more focused on.
