Toxic Male Politics,1.0,"Nov 7, 2025",Salary and equity used to be the biggest pro. This has changed last 3 years.,"High performing women beware. You are essentially entering a dysfunctional and archaic top-heavy male dominated leadership department that victimizes high performers to help justify their existence behind their excessive work travel, that effectively brings no Impact or CHANGE. Not even read-outs from their week long “workshops”. Frankly It feels like daycare for dads escaping their wives and children (that they openly complain about ad nauseam). “Leadership” is nowhere to be found. Professional development…no longer an annual GPS metric/conversation.They will use you and celebrate you and then cut your bonus in half and play mind games when it comes to pay. Truly the worst Legal department I’ve encountered in 20 years. HR is corrupt and hides behind the bullying and nonstop complaints. The last five years have been a downward spiral. Most women have complained and now shrug their shoulders and have become toxic just to survive. Not a happy, self respecting, innovative person to be found at this point,","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
Great place to work if you have a time machine that takes you back 15 years ago,1.0,"Oct 11, 2025","Most of the people (minus V.P. level leadership on up). Stock price, Stock options, the industry","1.More layers of useless leadership than needed. the phrase ""I have no idea what that person does"" is uttered at least once a week 2. The leadership team is never held accountable for poor performance, We are never asked for feedback on them while our annual reviews are very detailed and truly affect our $$$ raises (if you want to call it that) each year. 3. The silos are made of metal and non movable. It takes more signatures and approvals than a mortgage application to get something day. ""better to leave i the say it is....."" is the motto, 4. The company values are just words with no meaning. 5. Narcissism is the #1 quality of the majority of the leaders of the company. Give thema stage and they'll do great, but speak with them 1 X 1 and its like talking to a statue. 5.

We all were rooting for her. Look, the culture before Adaire wasn’t perfect. There were a lot politics at play and there definitely was some cleaning up to do, but we still felt like we were working for a winning company that continued to deliver results and didn’t treat us like a number. In the last year, that has all changed. The strategy seems to be simple. Cut as many headcount as possible without impacting the revenue. We now are all a number and worry weekly that we could be on the chopping block next. The most vulnerable are SVP’s and above. They all have a target on their back since so many have been shown the door and replaced.

Incompetent middle management let capable people go,2.0,"Nov 11, 2025","Large footprint, a big international company","Never-ending reorgs, layers of middle management—VPs, Senior Directors, and Directors—are busy managing up and securing their jobs.

Inherent bias & culture that rewards popularity over performance.,2.0,"Jun 6, 2025","-Truly international exposure. I worked daily with colleagues across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, which broadened my perspective and network. -Strong product portfolio. Supporting Equinix’s interconnection and colocation services lets you stand behind offerings that customers genuinely value. -Smart peers at all levels. When the company hires from top-tier firms, you meet talented people and learn modern practices—at least initially.","Nepotism and favoritism overshadow merit. Recognition often hinges more on how well you “fit in” socially (or how many drinks you can handle at the annual sales summit) than on the results you deliver. -Risk-averse leadership. Executives who’ve spent decades rising internally sometimes derail months of work because they get cold feet or feel threatened by fresh ideas. -Micromanagement as self-preservation. Rather than empowering high performers, some leaders over-control projects to signal their own importance. -Empty promises to experienced hires. New talent from FAANGs is courted with talk of big impact, only to see initiatives scrapped or redirected when real change becomes uncomfortable. -Lack of diversity and unconscious bias. The workforce and leadership are relatively homogeneous; decisions that disproportionately affect employees of color often go unexamined, and bias awareness is minimal.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
poorly executed change,1.0,"Oct 26, 2025","Long term employees who want the company success, market opportunity.","E-team leadership changes have crushed team collaboration, trust and psychological safety for those below ELT+ levels. People are constantly working in fear of layoffs and role changes. Also leaders hiring own people from previous gigs, even though poorly qualified and sycophants.

"Less talk, more action",2.0,"Jul 21, 2025","If you can work your way into a leadership role and establish a decent knowledge base, you will be rewarded. RTO for 2 days isn’t bad. Time will tell if policy doesn’t eventually creep back up. The freedom to work remotely is a good selling point in attracting talent and keeping it. There is a renewed sense of energy under new leadership, although the feeling amongst the revenue-generating roles is that we still need to move faster and with greater clarity. Still, optimism is there.","There is little collaboration and too much kingdom-building. The layers of leaders tend to manage upwards, leaving front-line managers in the lurch with little to no direction. More restrictions are being put around performance management despite the lack of direction, and new training and rules are handed down weekly to tighten the ropes. It’s highly demotivating.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

The few leaders left that have survived the leadership cleanup are now pretending like they were not a part of the past leadership. It's sad to see what can go wrong with a great company after a change in leadership. The thing they know to do best now is layoffs without any proper planning. HR is the worst, don't even get me started. Sad thing is this current leadership will sink the company, and by the time the Board wakes up to its responsibility it might be too late.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Rudderless,3.0,"Aug 17, 2025",Decent pay. Not top-tier but likely at least in the 70th percentile or higher. Phenomenal benefits. Seriously I've been pretty spoiled by tech industry benefits as a whole but aside from a mediocre 401k match (typical 50% of 6%) with a industry sub-par vest (25% per year over 4 years) Equinix's benefits were among the best I've ever had... and the 401k benefits were only mediocre/sub-par by previous employer/tech-industry standards. They're pretty average as a whole.,"Lots of initiatives, little follow through and even less accountability Delays, delays, delays - that reorg that was supposed to be done in 6 months? Basically still happening 4 years later after multiple changes in scope and ""re"" announcements. Maybe one or 2 of them actually ""completed"" but the job didn't seem to actually change or if it did, it seemed to barely catch its breath before announcing another re-org/change to the point it at least felt like one long continuous re-org that was forever delayed. Those quarterly goals that by definition should be allotted the entire quarter to complete and should be easy enough for management to proactively plan ahead for? Yeah they're still discussing them and they'll get released 3-4 weeks, maybe even 6 weeks, into the quarter; and dont be surprised if we add or update a goal in week 8 but dont worry it'll be an easy one. Most of the goals were meaningless busy work too or things that you'd do one quarter but the next quarter would be completely useless thanks to the re-orgs (not sure how we're supposed to build job training content when you cant define the role or what value the content brings if you are telling us the role will be significantly different in 6 months time). Plenty of managers who dont seem to actually do anything but not much room for career growth unless you're really close buddy-buddy with a manager. Have pulled the rug out from customers multiple times with facilities closures and sunsetting of services (particularly metal). Sub-par raises. Tool-happy. Have a problem? There's probably a tool for that. And if there's not, we'll build one. Why fix the problem when we have so many tools we spent tons of money buying or developing ourselves for you to use! Poor communication across teams that are siloed and many are very rigid rather than helpful, too stuck on adhering to process and not enough on doing right by the customer. Quick to escalate to management overly-sensitive teams with a major blindspot for their own behaviors. Got an escalation to my management once for not responding to an email timely. It was a fair criticism but I pointed out I simply overlooked the email and the person in question never followed-up directly, just took it straight to management. Some months later, that person failed to respond to me, after multiple follow-ups I finally got them on a call and asked why I wasn't getting a response. After the call, they escalated to management that I ""cornered them"" on a call.

Once a great place to work is now just a typical cooperate America company,3.0,"Dec 29, 2023",Pro's are Paid time off and roles over each year with a max of 250 hours. Equinix offers ESPP and RSU's are typical. All the sales reps I have came in contact are great. Equinix does a great job at hiring the best sales people. In almost 9 years I never had one issue with any other coworker and quite a few have become lifetime long friends. Yearly sales kick off to Vegas is an awesome experience that Equinix puts in a lot of effort and money into. P-Club is also another amazing experience that Equinix puts a lot of thought an money into. Equinix is the best of the best when it comes to anything Data Center related and that why they can demand such premiums. Decent offices.,"Cons are- low compensation and based salary compared to most other similar roles at other big tech companies. Always changing the comp plan for the worst. Every year the comp plan is cut down and try to make it as complicated as possible. You will work harder and bring in more revenue but get paid less every year. There's a lot of guessing into how you will be paid and half the time the comps aren't paid correctly or have to wait months. Equinix in the last 2 years has really focus on commission pay outs and making sure they can claw back as much as possible. As a global company they have made cross selling with other regions difficult so they do not have to pay full comp if their are multiply reps involved which in a lot times multiply reps are needed! Also, for the last 2 years, Equinix seems to have really focus this effort and money on DEI. I am all for diversity but it's a point where it's in your face 24/7 now. Volunteering is being pushed harder every Q as it seems now it is more mandatory within the company. If you are comfortable in your AE position it looks down upon as you should aspire to be a manager or director one day. There a lot of great team managers and there are few who should not be managing a team. Equinix is huge on promoting within which is a huge pro but a lot times they will promote AE's to management level with no experience or training and seems to be based on how much they like you and not so much your performance. My former manager constantly canceled calls, was late and half the time was somewhere else (why her team was the worst performing). Equinix does not care about loyalty at all! No severance package for tenure reps that have been with Equinix for many years. It's a shame as Equinix was once a great place to work but the Cons now outweigh the Pros and they are chasing away great people. Just another corporate America company where you are just a number, nothing less, nothing more.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Generally speaking the employees at Equinix are very nice people and many are extremely passionate about, and dedicated to, the company's success.","As the company goes through a period of significant growth, the cultural is drastically changing. Moving from what was a start-up feel - all for one, one for all - to big company attitudes and politics. At the leadership level there is so much in-fighting that they are not unified in their approach to the opportunity we are so blessed to have in front of us, instead they are battling for recognition and building empires. And, the company's success has them believing that they are so good at their jobs, that they are unwilling to take feedback from the rank and file that perhaps all is not well in the kingdom - they conveniently chalk it up to the pace of growth and rest on the belief that ""everyone is replaceable"" as a convenient excuse for why key employees are exiting the building.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Engineering leaves much to desire,3.0,"May 8, 2019","Benefits like ESPP/RSUs, amazing data centers with key locations and excellent/friendly technicians, being known as ""The Internet"" given the interconnection/colo presence with a neutral-leaning business stance, there are quite a few awesome engineers and managers, a recent series of management changes to provide new(and hopefully, better) direction/vision, and possible peering options.","Performance reviews are a joke(Pulse survey/SMART goals): sure, there is career coaching and 1:1 sync-ups occasionally, but management rarely takes the feedback seriously and doesn't appear to have the courage to do anything to break modus operandi and improve things. For the current and potential power Equinix has, management and senior management squabble and squander it constantly with political fights leaving casualties being the customer(and their customers) and the employees. There is a heavy contract workforce causing quality issues and a rotating one in keeping the taxable employment down(and profitability/dividends up) justifiably so to some extent. The speed and scale with which software engineering delivers is astonishing for the workforce size: they're a byproduct of poor management, constantly shifting priorities/reorg'ing, and a lack of capable engineers. Additionally, not enough engineers rebuke plans/ideas and, in turn, endure a poor work/life balance that comes out in production quality which I think has lead to a state of mediocrity at best.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
Amazing company; I'm blessed to work and grow here!,5.0,"Oct 1, 2020","I *LOVE* working at Equinix. We have an outstanding culture. Our leaders truly care about employees. Colleagues here are hugely supportive of each other ""Put We Before Me"" (one of our Magic of Equinix values). We get to do really cool work that matters and has an impact. I can tangibly tie what I'm doing to our companies objectives, it's very satisfying. I get to try lots of new things in marketing, we're *always* innovating. AND, our CEO's ""I'm safe, I belong, I matter"" value system means I can really be myself here. I can be a senior leader *and* a mother. I don't have to separate those 2 parts of me. Especially during COVID with 2 kids in a house while I'm on zooms, we are all encouraged to do whatever is needed to be ok. Our CEO/CHRO put in a ""Wireless Wednesdays"" plan to help us all deal with COVID burnout. It has enabled me to get back to critical thinking about my area of the business - when was the last time you got to carve out time every week to do that (or whatever else you need to do in order to cope with the workload/COVID stressors)?!? There's a huge propensity to promote from within - far beyond any other company that I have worked at. My manager is amazing, she values all aspects of me.

An Exceptional Company to Work for,5.0,"Apr 24, 2021","I consider myself very fortunate to work for such a great organization. To start, upper management and the C-Level truly care about their employees well being. They instituted “Better Way Day Wednesdays” as a day to avoid internal Zoom calls when possible so employees can get a bit of a breather on “Zoom fatigue” and catch up on other work tasks like training that they’ve been meaning to do. One of the best things I love about Equinix is their continuing efforts to innovate and make smart investments in the platform. They are truly a technology driven organization and have a positive impact on their customers, employees, stakeholders and frankly the world. Another differentiator is everyone’s positive attitude. At other places I’ve worked, their was always negativity and disgruntled workers. Here everyone is happy about working for a such a great organization and it’s rare, if at all to come across an unhappy employee. Everyone is also so willing to lend their support at a moments notice. As far as I’m concerned I want to complete my career out at Equinix.","Hard to think of any, but maybe they can soon relax some of COVID rules currently in effect like allowing more people in the office and conference rooms.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Equinix serves and provides for an industry that is growing at a rapid pace, those on the back end need to keep up. -Always looking to improve their strategy: If there are gaps in either internal or external communications the company doesn't sweep it under the rug. Different organizations are constantly developing strategies to troubleshoot and identify the problem to improve moving forward. In addition, the company does not have strong hierarchical barriers. It doesn't matter if you're a VP or an associate, the communication you have with those within the company are always respected.

Marketing’s management struggle to understand what user experience means, even thinking that a new CMS system would remove the need for a design team. Often, Management undermines project scope, direction, and feedback from the design, content, and development functional experts. Management is notorious for responding to teams and functional leads with “let me look into that and I’ll get back to you” only to never get back to them. It’s common to see teams produce less than professional work only to have their manager receive promotions, this further alienates anyone with a lower title. Cross-functional work is super frustrating with management often creating toxic working relationships for functional teams. Lastly, management hires other management without including the teams they will work with, simply “here is your new manager”.

Marketing leadership team really works to drive for best practice (and there are several areas to improve because Equinix has grown so fast that at times it feels a bit like an overblown start-up.) Culture at company is taken very seriously -- its not just about the results but also how you get them. As a result there are very few jerks (and the company tries to avoid recruiting jerks and egos).,It's hard work and the pace of change might make some people uncomfortable (however marketing attrition is very low and Equinix attrition in general is low.) The big focus on culture might make some people uncomfortable if they don't like the focus on soft skills and how you relate to people.,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
Talent Acquisition,5.0,"Sep 25, 2015","Great ""family oriented company"", people really care about you. I'm often struck by how much time is spent talking about personal life. In fact just the other day I bumped into our CEO Steve Smith in the elevator and the first thing out off his mouth once I said hello was ""How was your weekend?"" - The CEO asking me about my weekend? AWESOME!!! Their charitable giving program and priorities are really amazing, matching your chosen charity contributions generously and prioritizing overall corporate giving towards internet access related projects at scale to ensure that ALL of earths citizens have an opportunity to participate in the educational and global marketplace advantages the world wide web has to offer. Obviously with 52 straight quarters of quarter over quarter growth and recent admission to S&P500 the company is going really well, which provides lots of opportunity for growth!",Still a start up feel after 17 years in business.

Lack of leadership in Marketing,2.0,"Apr 11, 2021","The pay is good, and the line workers are nice. The business is solid.","Good people are quitting every week. There are big departures across Marketing due to lack of leadership. People are not recognized for their work or value. Perhaps most unsettling for me was that there was zero interest in diversifying the leadership team. Perhaps emboldened by the CEO who posts Biblical verse on LinkedIn and promoted his political allies after winning the CEO job, there was zero indication anything was ever going to change. There are lots of calls and pretty messages about diversity, but the reality was truly ugly. Also concerning was the fact that there was zero vision in Marketing. Nothing that excited me, and no view what so ever of where marketing was going, why and what we were going to do about it. So I left and am much happier.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

I also had the opportunity to travel globally, build a team, and co-lead major initiatives. The relationships I developed during my time there have extended beyond my last day, which is great!","There are cons within every department, and I think the biggest challenge at the time was trying to figure out what it would take for me to get to the next level in my career.

When there is a focus on inclusiveness, how do the two reconcile? Did I mention inclusiveness..., yeah?

Most of the C-level executives are approachable, highly competent, accountable, really care about employees and are dedicated to making this a great place to work.","Newer management during this high-growth phase can be uninspiring. Big talk about strategy and high level goals is great, but without appropriate resourcing or a real willingness to listen and understand what it takes to implement things is resulting in frustration for many.

Nice building,"If you end up at Equinix, you will hear from a variety of c-suite leaders, starting with the CEO, who inundate you with an endless barrage of passionate, insistent and even teary-eyed proclamations about their sincere interest in creating a safe, diverse and inclusive culture. But be wary of those who proclaim too much. Nearly all of these c-suite leaders are insincere charlatans. Since joining Equinix, I’ve watched as C-suite leaders have not been held accountable for very bad behavior that is anything but inclusive and tolerant. Meanwhile, a large number of diverse employees have left the company while others have been passed up for white Christian candidates. The CEO loves to profess, but he will not hold his c-suite accountable for behavior that would make anyone who isn’t white and Christian feel safe. The hypocrisy and insincerity are appalling.

They seem as scared about losing their jobs as we are. -In marketing, it is often more about how you report what you do than what you ACTUALLY do. In many roles, there is little actual marketing really happening. -Company sings a great culture tune but it isn't practiced. Morale in many departments is terrible and instead of fixing it they threaten people about their ""negativity"" and treat them like criminals. -There are often the wrong people running projects. Instead of hiring experts in the field, people without the real skills are in charge of managing people who do know what they are doing, and the manager won't listen to those with the experience. There are some exceptions, but they are few. -There is no trust between the workers and management. People can't say if things aren't right, even though we are supposedly given the chance with the ""survey"". No one believes it won't come back to them. And any low ratings a team lead is given don't matter - they just give lip service to making changes or getting to the root of the problem. It never changes. -The real reviews for this company, especially marketing, have been pushed down by a concerted effort by management to get people in the company to write good reviews. They even hired a social media expert to fix it. Scroll down to last year and before, and you will see the reality of working here. It is sad, but true.

"Avoid ""Product & Engineering""",2.0,"Jun 24, 2021",- Compensation/stock are good for the industry and area. - Looks decent on the resume. - That's about it.,"Management is 100% tops-down. Seniors spend their time engaging in politics and asking middle management to figure out details they haven't fully understood, which are passed onto individual contributors who are too inexperienced to do so. Constant burning platforms and plans being thrown out the window because of new political developments at the top. Individual contributors have no voice and cannot influence what they deliver. Your skills are only useful if they help your manager deliver something to their manager. Customers and quality are not part of the equation. More effort is put into presenting upwards than building quality products. Paired with the constant chaos described above, talented contributors burn out quickly and teams become revolving doors. Work-life balance is not a thing here. Work is continually being done and discussed over 3 time zones. Teams that should be working together cannot. Some days start at 7, some days end at 1am. There are, however, daily calendar invites for 15-minute wellness breaks, and a meeting-free day that nobody adheres to. There is nobody left who understands customer behaviors or our existing systems. It feels very odd to work with teams who don't understand the things they're building. Test environments are frequently broken and inconsistent with customer experiences, which are a messy hodgepodge to begin with. Rather than fix debt, teams drop their work and chase new goals cooked up by disconnected management. Nothing gets done. Lots of siloing, incomplete features, duplicate work, and competing systems that have to be reconciled. Management never acknowledges these and simply marches forward with whatever they're tasked with that week. It's no wonder the products are so poor. Upward mobility doesn't exist here, on any level. There is no framework for growth if your only contributions are jumping exactly as high as you're asked to.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

AWS, MS Azure, and Google are going to start taking a serious bite out of the colocation business in the next few years as companies move away from IaaS and into PaaS/SaaS and consuming services via the internet.

B players hire C players,1.0,"Jul 5, 2016","The stock is at an all time high, there's no wonder the glass door ratings are so high. You can't (and won't) complain if you're an employee with RSUs.","We're at a stage in the company's growth where the very smart, entrepreneurial, creative, ambitious leaders - or leaders of the future - are exiting the building. Senior management is non-confrontational (they flat out don't address issues or move them aside), which is classic behavior in a company that is experiencing success. Yet, they are riding a wave that is largely fueled by market dynamics (but they believe it's their brilliance). Our founders got us into this position, not the current management (except the Chairman), and it's the founders who should take credit for the vision that continues to propel the company (yes we are executing, but that's a very different drum to beat). The reason the dynamic, game-changing people are leaving is because Equinix has become a place where politics rule. If you speak your mind you are at risk of getting demoted, pushed aside or fired. At a minimum you're pigeon holed as a problem (don't you know that only the leadership team knows the right answer?) and constantly battle head winds that prevent you from realizing your full potential (and the company from blazing new trails). As new leaders are brought on board or promoted from within, it's incredibly clear that B players rule the school, because they are hiring C players - people who won't speak up, won't push back, will just do what it takes to get by. These people are also the same ones who have little-to-no passion, are yes people, and are not interested in what's around the next corner for Equinix (only for themselves). They will make their bosses happy by not causing any problems, but they (and those who hire them) are the epitome of a Dilbert cartoon.

Stay away from IT (Enterprise Apps) team,1.0,"May 29, 2020",Business concept is amazing which means enterprise apps team has survived without adding any value to the organization.,"Where to begin. People are treated like commodities: There are managers and their ""stooges"" who over commit to requirements and make the team work in 3 timezones. Yes, pacific time, Singapore time and European time depending on requirements. When someone suggests improvements they are asked a rhetorical question ""So, you don't want to work?"". I have seen one ""stooge"" literally shouting at another member of the team in front of business partners. When asked why she did that, it got so escalated that they went into a smaller room and this lady was shouting and banging her desk. Everything that doesn't work is BSA mistake and then this shouting/ranting begins in earnest in front of entire floor. No program management at the company within IT: This is critically important because being a ""global"" company there needs to be coordination between business functions. Instead, each BSA is supposed to manage cross functional requirements from discovery, design, implementation, QA, UAT, deployment and support. Release management is a glorified system admin team. Multiple cross functional teams keep fighting (literally) during meetings and whoever has more influence gets the work: There are 2 main IT development teams in Singapore and Sunnyvale/Dallas. There is close to no coordination between them. In fact, there is a lot of politics and infighting instead. Being a BSA dealing with a solution given strict timelines, is a nightmare when these teams can't agree on anything.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Chicago location more corrupt than the city itself,1.0,"Jun 1, 2016","Fair pay based on industry standard, though not the best in the market. Based on the expectations you are given, the pay should be substantially higher. ESPP is a good considering their strong presence in market value. Health insurance choices, you at least have options. Decent bonus program.","Where do I begin... Health insurance premiums are way too high for half decent coverage. They provide breakfast twice a week which is probably cool to most people, but Equinix prides on it so much and fails to realize most companies in the industry will offer it daily. Theft in this place is mind boggling, do NOT leave your tools anywhere for a moment or you'll find that it's not yours anymore. Most managers never leave their seat unless it's to visit the loo, otherwise they're constantly calling you to their office and handing new tasks but then later asking to re-do them because the plans change or they're assigning you to a totally different task while your initial one remains incomplete. The most inefficient management staff I've seen in my entire career. Management refuses to take responsibility and are very quick to place the blame on someone of lower rank. The potential reason they do this is because senior management is quick to fire. So it is safe to say most of the management team actions stems from fear in the senior director/VP levels. Policies, procedures, responsibilities and expectations change and grow faster than the company itself. New rules put in place to hurt staff rather than help them, management acts as if ""I'm here if you have any questions or are in need of help"" which typically translates to ""I'm here, maybe not for you... but I'm here"". You are a number, NOT a human. If you slow down from a bad day or are simply being more thorough in your work to give excellent quality, they will threaten your job. Yet, on the other side of that... if you rush yourself and make an honest mistake, you're out the door! The choice is yours but it's honestly a double edged sword. I've seen a tech of 3 years, always put in an honest days work, committed to overtime, never late, the epitome of a perfect employee... was walked out because of a accidental disconnect (his first mistake ever). I've seen a supervisor, the only good supervisor they had walked out for protecting his team. Then stripped of most of his life investments while working for the company for almost 10 years. Absolutely no room for advancement in this company unless you'd like to move to California or transfer to the sales teams. The certification and training programs are borderline comical. When I was interviewed, i was under the impression i would be in a system admin or network admin role with all of the OS and networking questions that were asked. Then when I started, I felt baited being only responsible for 3 layers of support. They talk about culture & values, yet you'll only get that in California or in sales. In the data center realm of Equinix (IBX)... It doesn't exist. They'll promise you 10% bonuses annually. No tech has ever seen a full bonus there. I, myself saw 5%. I've seen other employee bonuses even under that. Political class greed dwells in this building at an extreme rate with copper recycling. Beware that these are senior level employees breaking policy but are quick to fire lower ranked employees for small issues. Please take this all with a grain of salt if you wish, I have given this about a good long cool-down before posting here so that i can accurately warn future employees. If you consider any IBX position with this company, specifically south loop Chicago location... please reconsider.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

There is a clear line between management and operations staff with no relationship at all. That's what used to make this a great company. The senior managers and directors would level with the staff and have a good relationship with them, now its the opposite. They push the boundaries and see how much more they can squeeze from you before you break, and they seem happy for the long time employees to leave so they can brainwash and manipulate the next generation of minions.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Toxic Senior Management,1.0,"Jun 25, 2025",The teams on the ground doing the work are all fantastic. They work hard and contribute fully. They pivot when needed. My colleagues and peers are one of the best I've worked with.,"During my time at the organization, I observed that senior leadership often prioritized their own interests and brought in favored individuals, creating a divisive and unhealthy environment. I felt undervalued and treated as expendable, rather than as a valued team member. Leadership was disconnected from daily operations, relying on select leaders for information and making misguided decisions. This resulted in a lack of support, unjustified feedback, and unprofessional behavior, including undermining team members and avoiding direct conversations. The toxic culture led to longer hours, increased stress, and constant shifts in priorities without clear guidance. Much time was wasted on unnecessary escalations and navigating internal politics, which hurt morale and productivity. Career progression was limited by favoritism, and I often avoided advancement due to toxic team environments. Manipulation disguised as change led to delays and disruptions, while toxic behaviors were consistently overlooked. Overall, my experience was defined by poor communication, lack of transparency, and a culture that did not foster trust or respect.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

"Disappointing Environment: Low Pay, Poor Work-Life Balance, and Management Issues",1.0,"Oct 10, 2024","The only positive aspect of working here is the coworkers. Initially, they are friendly and supportive, creating a welcoming atmosphere. However, this doesn't last. Over time, you'll notice your colleagues losing their smiles and enthusiasm.

Downward spiral and ‘if the face fits’,1.0,"May 20, 2025","Clean and nice working environments, albeit a little too warm in some areas of the data halls due to ‘energy saving’. Can build strong relationships with colleagues in the team. Overtime rate isn’t too bad Holiday allowance is good, options to buy more etc Opting into the shares is good, good money saving tactic.","Right, where to begin. Firstly I’ll start with addressing the title of this review, ‘if the face fits’ seems to sum up the company and team rather well. There are HUGE levels of favouritism within Equinix, which mainly is what caused me to become a ‘former’ employee but also the bullish vindictive managerial behaviours also drove me out. Favouritism can be seen across the board, from upper management prioritising specific teams and individuals right down to the personnel actually in some of the teams. I wholeheartedly believe that if you aren’t willing to become a company robot by living and breathing Equinix and adopting their controlling, vindictive behaviours then you will not progress at Equinix regardless of skill set. For example, there are people in certain positions that shouldn’t be, ‘engineering managers’ who have never been engineers themselves, how does that work? Management will actively seek out some individuals they just don’t like and use any tiny negatives against them. Positive feedback isn’t a thing at Equinix, it may appear in the monthly team meetings but behind the scenes managers will do all they can to find negatives to use against people in the annual pay rise and bonus. Equinix actually adopt a company value called ‘speak up, step up’ but best believe if you engage in that value then you will be penalised one way or another. Managers do not seem to care about accusations of favouritism taking place. Different treatment is often dealt out depending on who you are, what level you are and to what extent you are liked. If you express a negative opinion in the way the managers operate, then that will be used against you. GPS goals based reward system is utter nonsense. It seems you can write whatever you wish in there but fundamentally it seems as though the annual rewards are based on how much they like or dislike you and how often you raise issues with their management style or the actual core business. If they want you out then they’ll make it known in the annual GPS rewards. Quarterly anonymous pulse surveys were almost comedic. Barely any of the questions in the survey would be relatable to the engineering teams. The questions were largely just corporate nonsense. The survey was never really taken seriously anyway, writing any constructive criticism in the survey would just be overlooked and the favourite way for managers to respond to criticism is ‘that doesn’t happen, this person is just being difficult and negative’. You would find many people to write similar things which would tell me that there’s a general view or consensus that those things need addressing? But no, not according to the managers. It was very much a ‘us and them’ mentality between the engineers and managers. Cost cutting de motivates employees which only seems to impact lower level teams and employees. No doubt senior management will probably be flying around the globe in business class seats expensed fully on SAP concur all whilst back in Slough there is an emphasis on reducing the weekly breakfast delivered to the IBX’s. Multi billion dollar company by the way and they’re worried about bacon rolls. Overtime being cut, team building events being cut, increasing the temperature in data halls to save energy and money… these things and more just seem detrimental to the lower level individuals. The impact of budget control slides downhill, the senior managers on 6 figure salaries aren’t impacted the same way lower level employees are. Equinix conduct mental health charity events, offer an employee assistance programme and also provide wellbeing days given to employees as a company shutdown in support of mental health awareness, however if you are off with an illness or even paternity leave, then that will be used against you in the GPS annual rewards (bonus and pay rise). ‘We cannot be seen to reward time off’ is a statement often used by the management teams. In my opinion it’s not about rewarding it, it’s about treating people equally and not penalising people for things that is also impacting their daily lives. Are employees really meant to feel valued if they are financially impacted during a health crisis? In my opinion equal pay isn’t exemplified and management will threaten disciplinary action against those who discuss salary with their colleagues. This is against the Equality Act 2010. The same managers also believe that the company policy advises employees not to discuss salaries and if employees are found to do so then disciplinary action would follow. This just gives off controlling managerial behaviour I think. Company strategies and ‘global ops meetings’ usually contain the predictable big worded corporate nonsense that in no way relates to the lower level teams on the data centre floor. I don’t think senior management actually understand what it is the engineering teams do and how fundamental they are to the business which in turn leads to the teams being overlooked. Rival companies offer significantly greater employment packages and poach people from Equinix. It’s as if Equinix is actually a stepping stone to progress to higher roles externally not internally. College of Equinix it feels like! Engineering teams are always in conflict with one another. Technical issues within the infrastructure are raised by engineers but some often are not acted upon and the issues are then overlooked.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

When such feedback is not given, these managers retaliate by bullying the individual, using any opportunity to undermine them, particularly during moments of vulnerability.

[To apply for many things including mobility, roles and projects prior approval from line managers must be obtained, effectively granting them disproportionate authority over employees] Equinix has shifted from a Growth/medium stock to Blend/medium.

Does not value Operations employees,2.0,"May 6, 2024","I can only speak to the quality of Operations employees. -Lower management can create a strong team and a great overall immediate work environment. -Site management knowledgeable. -Great company for your CV and to learn to industry. -Sites around the world, could potentially get a job anywhere. -Overall competitive benefits like the RPP match, and health insurance. -EV charging on site. -Company provided laptop and cell phone for work use. -Company branded clothing for uniform provided (shirts, hats, sweaters etc..). -Lunch once a week is provided, quality will vary on the day and sites contracted caterer. -Free coffee and snacks ordered on average every two weeks.","-Easier to negotiate pay as new hires then loyal employees. *(something to consider for anyone applying)* The justifications are completely arbitrary. Multiple new hires have started at higher wages then the person training them. Entire sites staff are being trained with little to no workload at significantly higher starting pay then the established top performing sites that are training them. -Many policies and expenditures around OpEx/CapEx that show they don't care about employees. CapEx budget seems to be unlimited but once the site needs improvements both for the operations staff/equipment and providing quality of life for customers, there isn't any budget to be found. -Every white collar position gets an additional large stock bonus, and generally higher starting pay even with 0 data center experience or service/product brochure knowledge. On top of the generally better schedule and flexibility to WFH. -Less than average starting sick/personal days, Only average starting vacation days. Some of these things differ in AMER and EMEA (EU), for example more vacation days in EU and higher premiums (double NA) for rotation shifts. -Too much focus on DEI when hiring. Above site management were filtering CVs based on checking boxes and deprioritizing people with data center experience. -Old office equipment such as desks and chairs, no budget.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Best organisation I have ever worked for,5.0,"Oct 7, 2020","When I am asked what makes Equinix such a special place to work I always say its the people and the culture. Our culture embraces each individual and the unique views and ideas that everyone brings that plays a part in who we are today and what we will look like tomorrow. Our people are our true differentiation Diversity, Inclusion and belonging are not just words that are thrown around loosely but are lived and breathed from the top down. It is part of our DNA. Not only is our remuneration packages generous but the benefits that we receive are industry leading. An example of this is additional to our standard leave, Equinix provide 3 extra days of annual leave to every employee during Xmas . Also when we were forced to work from home due to COVID each employee was provided with funds by Equinix to help set up their work environment at home. However, what transpired recently truly typified the great company that Equinix is to be part of. Equinix recognised the enormous effort and sacrifices people have made over the last 7 months while working through a global pandemic. Equinix took the initiative to give all employees two days off to recharge and refresh. This demonstrated a genuine appreciation of everyone's efforts and sacrifices during COVID. Equinix generosity and giving is not confined only to its employees. Equinix also gives back into the community in many ways through initiatives such as our Impact program. This allows Equinix employees to chose nominated charities or programs to support whether through donations or hours of service, which Equinix will match. This is definitely the best organisation that I have ever worked for.",Unfortunately some of our processes and systems need work to improve our efficiencies.,"Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

Data Centre Operations,4.0,"Nov 17, 2021","Great work-life balance and a very stable employment. It's a good entry-level position. Equinix offers a range of events and parties where one can meet the other teams and make connections. Equinix IBX Ops department is like an university for people to hang on to for a while, and those who excel can always try their luck and apply for a more mature role.","First and foremost, little room for progression - there is no viable progression line for IBX Operations and this department is quite disconnected with the rest of the business. As the business grows, more and more responsibilities are taken off the technicians and it's easy to get stuck in one role for 10+ years with no extra training and nothing to stand for in your CV. Long term, it's far more reasonable to apply for an internship/apprentice positions in i.e. facilities management or other departments where serious growth opportunities are present and majority of people are hired from within. The remuneration is slightly lower than competitors, especially for a lack of London/Slough location bonus - but it is just 'about fair' for an entry level job like this. There are loads of overtime opportunities for a 4-on/4-off Shift Role though, and most of the people stay for that reason. The salaries also don't really vary for permanent employees and junior team members are often paid the same salary as more experienced technicians. Some that were hired through M&A processes are starting with less than the minimum budget - it is however more a fault of HR rather than intentional.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

"Great culture, mediocare pay",4.0,"Apr 14, 2022","Equinix is your standard ""great culture, avg pay"" company. Their pay is mediocre but they make up for it in culture. The management team is very good and relaxed. This is great company to coast at if you're looking for a 9 to 5 job. Overall, great for people with kids or mid/late in their careers","There's really only two main Cons. 1. First, this is a small company, only a few thousand employees (globally combined, even less in US). This means there aren't a lot of internal opportunities for vertical promotions to other teams. The pay is also average but acceptable. 2. For some reason, the management team here is really proud of working here. They make it sound like they work at Google. Let me be clear, NOBODY has hard of Equinix. When I was interviewing for other jobs, people regularly thought I worked at Equinox. So adding ""Equinix"" to your resume is the same as adding a startup to your resume. Zero brand value. 1 year at a FAANG is worth 10 years here. If this is something that's important to you, then skip Equinix. But again, if you're looking for a relaxed place to work, Equinix is good.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
"No development, no improvement, nightmarish infrastructure",2.0,"Apr 23, 2021",You work with friendly people from all around the world,"Management is slow and ineffective to take decisions. The information and infrastructure that you rely on to do your work is spread across several systems and platforms, which are all too complex and have many bugs, and thus impair your capacity to work efficiently. Managers constantly tell you that ""that's how it is"" and that ""we have to work with it"" instead of raising a voice and speaking to superiors about problems. There are incompetent people who sometimes can't even follow simple instructions in emails. Currently there is a fixation with cumbersome trainings and enhancements which really don't add any value to the customer because the infrastructure is full of errors anyways. Even the customers complain about this but their complaints never make it to the people that need to hear it. You are also penalized immensely for the smallest mistake such as not clicking a checkbox when creating a ticket or not saying some words in a precise order during a call with the customer. The salary is not even high enough to tolerate all of this, and there is also very little chance for professional development, not to mention that you will be offered only a B2B (outsourcing) contract.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm

I have previously worked for 3 other companies in UK (smaller as well as larger than this) but so far this is the best experience I've had with employer. Reasons: - Career progression conversation is not a taboo - it's welcome and encouraged, they want you to grow and develop. In my previous job internal applications could be blocked by your own manager as they didn't want people moving from certain departments - Compensation is great with some really nice benefits. I've had better benefits before but what we have here is more than sufficient in my opinion - Healthy work/life balance is encouraged. No one expects me to do any overtime. You can sometimes end up doing it on occasion as you care about the job but then the hours can be flexible. They truly care about your well-being. COVID response has been incredible, they've provided me with everything I need to work from home comfortably - I receive on-going support from my team and management. No one leaves you to ""sink or swim"". People are happy to help you and always find time.

Great Place to Work and Great Compensation,4.0,"Aug 2, 2022","- Lots of flexibility and work-life balance. - Management appreciates initiative and will often integrate employees' ideas into the product. - The salary may not apparently be that amazing but there are large RSU bonuses after the first year that largely increase it, especially if you're working in a lower cost of living country. - Managers tend not to micro-manage and trusts engineers to do the right things. - Possibility to travel to the HQ and to trainings/conferences. - If you're self-motivated, there's a lot of room for growth. - If you come up with a new product from scratch, and you can prove to your manager that you can execute it to release, senior management will let you spend time and resources on building it. Of course, it might take some convincing. - There is legal support for patents","- There is a very large percentage of Indian coworkers, especially in the US, so you will struggle if you don't understand English with an Indian accent or if you aren't used to their culture. - Depending on your team, Agile might be a fancy keyword that covers an at-best-Kanban or at-worst-Waterfall approach. - Promotions/raises are difficult to come by unless you leverage another company's offer. Many manager's have a ""everyone should get an equal raise"" approach, which benefits under-performers and frustrates high-achievers. - You might get stuck in a project that has very little algorithm work and instead mostly DTO modelling and REST request/response building.

But Equinix has a burnout spiral culture and this is wrongly considered normal. The work demand is absolutely insane, often out of control. Taking care of a portfolio of hundreds of accounts should not be considered normal. Working as a CSM, Administrative Assistant, Project Manager, Customer Service Agent, Activation Assistant, and Cleaner for obsolete tools should not be considered normal. Being considered the role responsible to make all other teams talk to themselves as they do not basically communicate properly should not be considered normal. The ironic point is: the company organized some mental health webinars and/or web sessions, but we did not have time to join as we were under an huge work demand. Additionally, the CSM wage is very below compared to other IT companies. Lots of good talents leave the company every quarter making the turnover for CSM position one of the highest I ever seen. Company slogan is: ""put the customer at the center of everything"". But, given what is wrote above I ask. HOW??? The colocation portfolio is awesome. On the other hand, part of Managed Services portofolio and processes are amateur which makes the CSM daily job even heavier. Local leadership did everything possible, however, they were unable to make big improvements as big decisions depended on the CS Directors in the US. I do believe the directors were aware of all problems and, honestly, they don't have the competence enough to do what needed to be done or to appoint a local Director able to do it.","Equinix, Inc.",EQIX,Data Center,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equinix-Reviews-E11296.htm
