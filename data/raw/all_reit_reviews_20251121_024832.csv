Toxic corporate work environment,1.0,"Sep 29, 2023","Free snacks and drinks every day when in office, lots of Brandywine branded swag, good health benefits, some great people to work with, huge budget for projects.","The work environment at the company is characterized by a pervasive culture of competitiveness, where personal advancement often takes precedence over ethical conduct. Interactions with colleagues are marred by an ulterior motive to extract information that can be later used against individuals. Furthermore, the marketing department is overseen by managers lacking design expertise, leading to a lack of understanding regarding project complexities and time requirements for designers. Employees are unfortunately treated as expendable resources due to the abundance of job applications received. The marketing department witnesses a high turnover rate, except for upper management, who remain insulated from these changes. Attempts to address the excessive workload have been met with dismissive responses, fostering a tense atmosphere in the office. Interpersonal conflicts are rampant within the department, exacerbated by the exclusivity of decision-making among a select few individuals. Until the company acknowledges and acts upon the feedback provided, particularly concerning the need for a manager with a design background who can advocate for the designers, this cycle of high turnover is likely to persist. Unfortunately, the current project manager has not demonstrated the willingness or ability to fulfill this role. Additionally, the company does not prioritize the mental well-being of its employees, focusing primarily on meeting deadlines and discouraging expressions of concern. It is imperative for the company to reevaluate its management approach, fostering a supportive and inclusive environment that values the contributions and mental health of its workforce.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm

Being a lean real estate company, with low employee turn-over, sometimes it feels as though there's no clear path to taking on leadership roles within company.

Waspy and Plastic,1.0,"Jul 1, 2020",The office is beautiful and some departments are great.,"In accounting it is a toxic working environment. The workload is unreasonable and you are expected to work late everyday as well as on weekends and while on vacation or leave. Office politics are heavy and so workload is distributed unevenly and they suffer from being severely understaffed. As a result the turnover rate is incredibly high. When things go wrong there is no accountability from management and the blame is often unfairly shifted. There is also a 'firing culture' unlike anything I've ever seen. Anything bad that happens they sweep under the rug and because of the culture people are too afraid to speak up. It really is a nightmare workplace. Steer clear of accounting.

This is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.,5.0,"Jan 21, 2025","Here’s the updated review incorporating your new points: 5 Stars - The Best Employer I’ve Worked For Starting with CBL 9 months ago has been one of the best career decisions I’ve ever made. After 22 years in the industry and working with countless management companies (many of which left much to be desired), I was blown away by how different CBL truly is. Their vetting process was extensive and, though it was intense, you could tell they were on the right path and committed to finding the best fit for their team. From the very beginning, it was clear that they take the time to know their people and ensure they’re making the right decisions for both the company and the employee. From day one, CBL has exceeded my expectations. The interviews were engaging and professional, and it was apparent they do things the right way. Their commitment to excellence shines in every aspect of the organization, from onboarding to competitive pay and generous benefits. At the same time, CBL expects the same level of dedication and work ethic from its employees. But that’s easy to deliver when you work for a company that genuinely supports you, values your input, and stands behind your decisions. The work is challenging—this is not a company for slackers—but it’s rewarding. About a month ago, when the mall I worked at went on the market and was sold, I was initially devastated. Typically, when a mall changes ownership, the staff either transitions to the new owners or is left in a precarious position. After only 8 months in my role, I feared losing CBL as my employer. However, I reached out to HR to express my interest in staying with the company, and to my surprise and gratitude, they went above and beyond to retain me. Despite being new, they recognized my situation and offered to transfer me to a mall in another state. This level of care and support is something I’ve never experienced with a management company. The benefits CBL provides are incredible—almost entirely employer-paid, generous paid time off, and an exceptional work-life balance. The management team is phenomenal, with centuries of combined experience, and my boss is hands-down amazing. The pay is on the higher end of the spectrum, if not the highest, and everyone I’ve worked with LOVES this company. It’s no wonder employees stay for 20+ years. In fact, I’ve heard of many who left to try other companies, only to return months later because the grass is simply not greener on the other side. This review is completely unsolicited—I’m writing it because I feel compelled to share how great this company is. If you are top talent, this is a company you must work for. As long as you do your job, they will always show up with your check and have your back. CBL is, without a doubt, the best company I’ve worked for. I trust and value my coworkers implicitly—they’re not only great people but also immensely talented in their fields. I couldn’t ask for a better employer or a better team.",None-- and I love to complain,CBL Properties,CBL,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CBL-and-Associates-Properties-Reviews-E2378.htm

I was actually at meetings where there was not a single female speaker featured and there was an exceptional celebration of sports coaches from Utah and of sports in general (I don't mind sports, but when that is ALL that is featured, it gets old). They will tout how important family is, however, they have no compunction about forcing work/travel on weekends without giving any comp time in exchange, which is just silly. I truly feel that the only reason one of the larger developers haven't done a take over of this company is that it would be too much work to sell the 50 ugly properties in order to secure the 15 solid ones and the 25 so-so ones.

Clerical Assistant,1.0,"Aug 25, 2018","Exceptional design and cleanliness to the Columbia office building. The CEO there at the time Mr. Griffin was very personable, smart and diligent.","This was by far my worst job ever. I was offered a job as a low-level clerical assistant working with the two teams, the legal department and investments team. This was my first full time job straight out of college and I absolutely dreaded coming to work everyday. I would go weeks without seeing my manager for the investments team, so many worked and assisted the legal team. The assist I worked under was the executive assistant to the VP of Legal and she did nothing but all day but suck up to her boss while talking about her behind her back and boss me around. She treated me very awful, and would raise her voice to me over little things I did wrong to the point where I would go home crying every day. But, at the same time I felt bad for her because she would be treated twice as as worse by the VP, so most days I let it go. The remaining members of the legal team I worked under were extremely pretentious, rude and unprofessional. I left after only 6 months of being employed there and I decided to resign after I met with my two bosses VP of Legal and VP of Investments for my three month performance evaluation, which conveniently took place 5 months into my employment. At that time they decided to advise me that my performance was subpar and I was taking too much time off from work, mind you I had braces on at that time and needed to visit the Orthodontist pretty often. They explained I was negative and rude to my counterparts, and at that time they were probably right because I had had enough with my coworkers yelling at me and treating me that way. Needless to say I finally got out, six months too long. I’ve had several jobs since that one and no other job I’ve ever been in has ever come close to how bad this one was.",COPT Defense Properties,CDP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm

Strong peer collaboration and camaraderie among frontline recruiters.","Senior leadership within Talent Acquisition lacks trust in their team and consistently fails to lead with strategy or vision. Decisions are reactive, not proactive, and often made without transparency or input from those closest to the work. There is a clear and persistent favoritism toward corporate recruiting teams, despite the high-volume team being responsible for filling the vast majority of roles across the company. Recognition, advancement, and compensation are not aligned with performance. Employees are expected to take on strategic initiatives or larger projects and scope of work with no end date in sight and without formal acknowledgment or pay equity. Concerns raised through appropriate channels were either ignored or met with vague responses, and in some cases, were followed by restructuring decisions that created unnecessary competition and instability.

Close to home,3.0,"Oct 7, 2023",Work is very close to home and my supervisor is probably the best supervisor I’ve ever had. He is very flexible with my hours being i and a single father who has split custody so some days I have to come in late or i am unable to stay late when it’s busy. But he also knows that I will come in in the middle of the night of on the weekends to finish repairs so we have enough truck to get the freight where it needs it to go on time.,Being it it a publicly traded company it is much more difficult to order and stock parts me need to do our jobs. Also tools for the shop that the employer would normally provide either never get purchased or a technician has to refuse to repair a machine/ truck until they have the proper tools for safety reasons. This is not at fault of our shop supervisor but more of the hoops that they would Have to Jump Through to get such purchases approved. Since americold purchased halls warehouses over 2 years ago we still have yet to receive a parts washer so we are forced to use far more brake clean than would be normally used. Not only a waste of money but a hit to employee health and safety. Also understaffing is a huge problem. I have a few friends who I would have apply but the income offers are laughable sometimes. I feel like if you pay good wages you will Get the people who want to work and take pride in it. And you can easily weed out the people who don’t want the money. But It just in our department that is understaffed but everywhere it seems. I have tried numerous times to get my child support payments taken out of payroll before direct deposit with no luck. Even been arrested and released due to this issue. But I also understand that the HR rep that I have has a lot of other people she is responsible for and things slip through the cracks. I do love working here and the people i directly work with but we were promised apt when americold took over like all brand new tools and lunches every month and much more and we haven’t seen any of it. And might I add when corporate reps came around after the acquisition of halls they talked a good game they said we brought each of u a gift… it was hats and water bottles. But they didn’t bring enough for everyone… that right there kinda set the tone. I did receive a raise when they took over which was nice but it was nowhere near what I was offer at other companies 2 years prior coming out of technical school.

In the long run, Americold will have a well integrated and competitive operation. There are some good learning opportunities for many people along the way.","A private equity company named Yucaipa calls the shots and Yucaipa is run by billionaire Ron Burkle. The strategy a few years ago was to invest, grow, and go public. The Versacold acquisition added a lot of debt and antiquated systems. The investment was made but the growth didn't follow, in part because of the economy. Going public turned out not to be an option. The management team that initiated and was executing the strategy has been fired or has quit and been replaced by a team that is charged with a strategy of cutting cost, leveraging the company with debt, and returning more profit to Yucaipa. This is why there have been layoffs the last couple of years and a difficult work environment for those that remain.

Mediocrity At Its Best,2.0,"Nov 19, 2014",My co-workers were good people to be around. There was room for growth early on. Tuition reimbursement option is a plus for students.,"Leadership has no vision. Leadership cares not about the culture or morale of the employees. Workload is not equivalent to the pay unless you are VP or above, and then the paradigm shifts in the other direction. Appreciation is only communicated in a halfhearted verbal method, and never interprets into pay increases or other benefits. ""Merit Increase"" program is actually an annual across-the-board cost of living increase. No matter how much merit you bring to the table, you will often see the same increase as some of your lazier and less-motivated counterparts. The Human Resources team is a toxic group with multiple agendas and unchecked power. They are very intrusive, manipulative and controlling. I worked for Americold for more than 5 years, and built tons of good personal relationships - NO ONE LIKES THEIR JOB. I have never heard anyone brag on this company, or defend it when someone else bashes it. The shame of it all is that Americold has the resources and funds to be the absolute best company in the industry, but no one wants to take the time to creatively motivate, incentivize or appreciate the people doing the legwork.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

Average company with alot of transitional turnover,2.0,"Apr 27, 2014",Because of the high turnover rate there is always an oportunity to start on 3rd shift and move to first or second shift. Hourly employees have good benefits as far as paid time off and the ability to work over - time to compensate for the mediocre wage. Health care is good for what you contribute each month.,"As a supervisor you are salaried 50 hours a week, this equates to less than an houlry wage of the people you are supervising. Because the headquarters are in Atlanta, I don't feel the company values trickle down to the facilities. Alot of focus is given on customer service, which is great for job security, but the employees are not recognized for the sacrifice. Unless you have obtained a network of friends within the company, you are left on the outside looking in.

Stay far away from this company,1.0,"Nov 6, 2021",There are zero pros to working for this company.,"No leadership. No training, you have to try to figure it out. If you’re in any supervisor or manager position, they expect you to work from 5am to 10-11pm with no additional compensation. They have a revolving door of temporary workers so they don’t have to invest in hiring anyone. Absolutely terrible employee treatment. Upper management will yell at anyone in front of other staff. Front line employees are treated as expendable and replaceable. Sexual harassment investigations are not followed through with HR, they claim they investigate it but take no action when multiple people are filing claims against the same person. Women are treated as gophers and expected to cater to General Managers on any whim they may have. If you try to take a day off, you are harassed by management and told you are not a “team player”. Then they will call you multiple times on your day off and tell you that you have to come in, or you will get fired - even if you’ve stated that you have consumed alcohol and cannot drive. Personal and confidential employee information is easily accessible, often times it’s left in folders around the office or just thrown in the trash can with no shredding. There is no long term plan for anything.

Disrespect,1.0,"Aug 10, 2012","Lots of OT. As a selector, its a physically challenging work place. Most employees loose 20-30lbs within a few months.","There are too many cons to list, so here's my top three. One can easily hurt themselves in this environment. Slips, trips, and falls are common. The organization lacks the man power to keep the floors clean. Ice cubes are everywhere, and one single ice cube can take you out permanently. Broken open boxes of food are everywhere, and everything is frozen, adding to slipping hazards. The equipment (pallet jacks) operate poorly, forcing you to strain when steering. There incentive program allows employees to make $4.00 an hour more if they exceed the formulated performance level by 35%, in other words, working at a rate equal to 135% effective. Mathematically, the extra 35% effort is rewarded at less than the starting wage. The company benefits greatly by paying an incentive vs. OT Finally, after injuring my back, I found the company's HR department completely disregard all my emails, phone calls, and requests to further investigate my particular circumstances. Fairness and Openness are two of the company's core values. In my opinion, they completely disregarded these values.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,Industrial,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

They seem to like their positions.","I've only been here for a couple of months, but I have a lot of cons. First, the work area where I am situated is right in front of the copier (Legal, 5th FL, corporate office, ATL, GA). Therefore, it is noisy when the printer is being used, people are in and out and talk REALLY LOUD as if I am not there. If I am taking a conf. call or trying to concentrate, it makes for a hard time. I've asked for a better spot, but no results yet. Secondly, I wasn't aware until my orientation day that the PTO is only 2 weeks, to include vacation AND sick time/personal time. I would expect that if PTO vs Vacation/sick time, the company would provide 15 days (3 weeks) at a minimum. There is not work life balance when an employee cant use at least one full week of vacation (deducting sick time, dr. appts, etc, there's not much left). Lastly, they need to increase the number of company holidays. For ex, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas eve, MLK (which is a national holiday so not sure why we aren't observing it). Offering the option to tele-commute once a week would also help. Most progressive companies allow this and it enhances employee moral.

You might even develop a backbone because of how much you get walked on here!,"Everything. Working at Americold incites the same feeling as entering a dangerous map in a video game: you hear the ominous music upon entry and immediately have your guard up in case of attack. The HR department is hostile territory. The People who work there are vindictive, conniving, and only interested in their own personal gain. ""Teamwork"" doesn't apply here, especially if younger than everyone else. Your ""Peers"" will see you as inferior and take advantage of you. Management, which is full of incompetent and biased individuals, will only look out for their favorites. It doesn't matter how hard you work or how far of the extra mile you go, it's never enough. If the ""favorites"" are against you, everyone is. Despite complaints and tip line calls, management does NOTHING to fix the problem. You might get the same motivational speech every single time instead... I was denied vacation time for an emergency when literally EVERYONE in the department got approved to use their time for leisure trips. I was forced in at unreasonably early times when they know I work a 2nd job at night. I've been handed large responsibilities that were not part of my job description without any sort of raise or bonus, and was still expected to get it done along with the 20 other things I did daily.

Horrible,1.0,"Oct 21, 2015",Nothing. There was nothing I liked about working here.,"Everything. This is the number one worst place I have worked my entire life. Too cold (obvious) but that was the least of the troubles. The management team was so, so terrible and unprofessional. They would belittle employees and treat them like they are children. God forbid you park your lift to use the restroom for 2 minutes. Or find an inventory error and have to drive out to the inventory (every 20 minutes this happened) to have those guys belittle you as well. The work was horrible. Case pick and full pallet pick all mixed together, from anywhere in the warehouse. Whatever pick you pull up on your screen, you must complete it. No freedom or control whatsoever of inventory or pick orders. You can't chsnge the location of anything in the warehouse. There are some orders where you have to scan each individual case on the full pallet. Sometimes you have to tear apart the entire skid to scan each case so the weight of the cases can be entered into the system. There is an option where you can enter the full weight of the skid manually into the system without having to do all this work, but of course the inventory guys won't let you do it. The other people who worked there were very rude. Probably because their job sucks. Everyone drove their lifts like idiots. There was NO safety involved. They preached safety at the orientation but no where did I see it when I got out to the floor. We had to stand on our forks to pull 40-50lb boxes down from the tops of 8ft tall skids, and do it fast, while freezing cold. The production was BS.

Cold is the key word,1.0,"Sep 15, 2018",Some of your colleagues are nice and fun people.,"Pay is average at best. Difficult to get promotions unless someone retires or quits. Bonuses are very hush hush. Most people don't even know they exist and there is no real consistency behind who gets them regardless of what they say. Leadership is laughable and will try to bully subordinates then brag about it in meetings while simultaneously cowering in the face of any executive. Some people in middle management will smile in your face then speak very negatively of you when they think you're not listening and will directly impede your work efforts if collaboration is needed. No cups in the break room. The workload is unapologetically unreasonable. Most people are working the jobs of an entire team on their own and they are not happy about it. Of course, they begin to lash out and develop poor attitude after being overworked by the company. During the review season, employees are encouraged to not rate themselves too high, making it easier to justify waiting ""another year"" for a promotion.

Toxic Workplace and an HR Nightmare,1.0,"Aug 4, 2022",Hardworking people.

Good luck trying to use your earned PTO while being interrogated with questions on what you are using your PTO for (it's no one's business). Using sick hours is almost impossible since you get bullied for pretending to be ""sick"" when it is apparent. How this is sanitary and safe for a food storage facility is beyond me. They are constantly understaffed due to the lack of quality hires and no one being able to withstand the toxic culture longterm. People are hardworking and push themselves to the point of exhaustion, health complications, and lack of self care and mental health, and I have witnessed so many employee deaths during my time here. Many women I have worked with have been harassed, but the agressor do not face any consequences. Instead, management will ask if you have done anything to provoke their behavior and advances. This is definitely the good ol' boys' club culture.

No Work Life Balance,1.0,"Jan 14, 2023",Hiring process was seamless and fast. Plenty of lighting in the warehouse. Most workers willing to help and answer any questions. Store and fast food right down the street for breaks.,"Inventory issues: Many racks/bays missing labels making location overrides difficult. Item not is designated locations and often in Bay above or below or either side or not at all. When doing directed work go to location and item is not there. Item is behind front pallet. why is system having us take 1 to 2 pallets down to get to one pallet very inefficient. Sometimes second pallet is also incorrect very frustrating. Missing pallets could be above below to the right or left or in/at end the aisles it’s a huge problem. Facilities Maintenance Issues: Battery Changing Room has dozens of bays without chargers. Labels don't make any sense.  Older batteries don't last nearly as long and new batteries are hit or miss 70-90% cap. No battery staged on carriage after changing.  Most batteries are lacking proper maintenance and look like they are in bad shape.  Deteriorating hoses, valves, caps, & wires… Floor is cracked and uneven throughout facility especially at cooler entryways. Damaged racking Men’s locker room is a mess and deteriorating. Many toilets and sinks not working. System Issues: When staging wall locations don't work with wireless scanners requiring hand input for staging. Confirmation/acknowledge screen lacks last 4 numbers of order number. Wired scanners continuously mis-scan due to the amount of bar codes all in one spot. Wireless scanners are difficult to pair to vmu LTO are not credentialed to make changes to vmu. Can't even get to Bluetooth settings to pair scanner because IT has vmu locked down running login log-on scripts preventing users from accessing basic settings and apps like clock/calc. Ridiculous! When scanning staging area codes with wireless scanner you get the wrong input data. When scanning with wired after successful scan goes to case field instead of quantity field. After scanning an invalid pallet and setting the pallet aside then scanning correct pallet the system adds a zero to the field. Should be able to scan...field gets cleared...new number is input in to field. Paper inspections instead of computerized like iwarehouse. In 2 deep racks there will be two different products and system will ask you to get the deep pallet instead of face pallet. This system issues is the worst imo…let's say Red Prairie asks you to go to a 4 deep bulk bay to get a pallet that has 79 instead of 80 that pallet could literally be anywhere in that bay so you go to a cooler bulk bay and the pallet could be on any level a-f front middle rear. You have to go digging to find it! Process Issues: A few times per shift there will be tags on the product that are considered dead tags...third party reprint and still doesn't work requiring you to manually type in and re label. Evidently this happens because personnel unloading trucks neglected to re-label. Then they putaway by manually entering the number. So when you get assigned to pick that pallet you are not able to scan. Having to fill out slip for every pallet despite all the same product/order. Having to get off the lift several times throughout the shift to scan a pallet because the tags are not in correct location or behind wrap or non existent. Quality of life/work life balance: Can't have coffee coco unless you're on break yet coffee maker and coco packets are in control room not break room. After being in the -10 cooler for a couple hours back and forth would be nice to have access to hot beverage or heated room for several minutes that doesn't count against breaks. Floor suspension does not provide shock and vibration protection on several lifts causing knee and back pain. No notice for extended shift. Do not adhere to set schedule. They expect people to work 6 days a week 11 hours per shift with an unpaid lunch. In the beginning they will lie to get you to work for them claiming 4on 4off $26 an hour easy to get the incentive. It’s all lies! Expect same amount of work with half the personnel. No incentive unless list picking you'll average -30% to -40% if doing replenishment, putaways, staging outbounds. Expect to be at  -40% to -20% with all the inventory issues, dumped pallets, incorrect or missing pallets, having to wait on other LTO's to list pick...On a good day you might hit 0. They claim it's possible to reach +15% which would be the $24.50 plus 1.50 night differential but I doubt it. With all of the inventory and system issues you'll rarely hit +15% and if you were to hit that percentage consistently they'll make accusations of cheating the system. I have 3 years reach truck experience and 6 total forklift experience and never hit +15%. Best percentage based on reports was -32% and that was with me running all the stop signs and horn blaring! Management issues: Supervisors spend majority of shift in office. Managers have no idea what's going on totally oblivious. Blame game for anything and everything. I’ve never worked at a warehouse that had a general manager…what for?! Supervisor mistreated everyone spent entire shift in office not doing anything.

Better Every Days,5.0,"May 27, 2025","Starting a new job can be a little nerve-wracking, but my experience with Centerspace has been nothing short of incredible. From day one, I've felt supported, valued, and genuinely welcomed. One of the biggest pros has been the flexibility in working style—there’s a strong sense of trust here, and you’re encouraged to work in a way that brings out your best. What truly sets this company apart is its leadership team. They're not only accessible but also incredibly open to new ideas and different ways of doing things. It’s refreshing to be part of an organization where innovation is encouraged and your voice matters. You’re empowered to think boldly and “Dare to Win”—an approach that creates a dynamic and energizing work environment. I’ve also had the chance to challenge myself and grow in ways that are both exciting and rewarding. The work is engaging, and I’ve already learned so much in just a short time. On top of that, my co-workers have been amazing—friendly, genuine, and eager to build connections. There’s a shared commitment to getting “Better Every Days,” and that mindset shows up in both individual efforts and team collaboration. The culture is warm and welcoming, and that starts from the top. Even our CEO, Anne, took the time to personally reach out to see how my first few weeks were going. It’s clear that people come first here. The leadership team checks in regularly and truly wants to hear from us—not just in group settings but on a personal level too. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful to be part of such a thoughtful, forward-thinking company. It’s a place where people and progress go hand in hand, and where we’re all encouraged to grow, innovate, and make every day better.","As with any new role, there’s always a learning curve—and for me, the most significant one has been getting up to speed with the technology platforms used at Centerspace. While each system has its strengths, I’ve noticed that not all platforms fully integrate with one another, which can lead to some manual work to ensure consistency and alignment across different tools. This has been a great opportunity for me to better understand the current processes, and I appreciate the transparency and support from my team as I’ve navigated through it. At the same time, I see a real opportunity for process improvement, particularly in exploring how AI could be leveraged at a system level to streamline workflows, reduce manual tasks, and improve overall efficiency. I’m excited to see how technology can evolve here, and I’m confident that, given the company’s openness to innovation and continuous improvement, these enhancements are not only possible but well within reach.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Top Notch Support & Culture,5.0,"Mar 9, 2023","Great work/life balance that is respected by leaders. Benefits are tough to beat. Culturally, having worked for multiple Multi-Family Housing Companies, CenterSpace talks the talk, and walks the walk. Support is amazing & every employee I've reached out to has been happy to lend a hand whenever necessary. One of their keys, is ""One Team"", which means that although we all work at our individual properties, we're one company and we are all on the same team. It's not just a key, or a hashtag, it's actually true.","Depending on the position, days can be heavy. We deal with the 4 most important things in peoples lives: their homes, pets, cars & money. That's not necessarily a con for the company but the industry. As managers, it's not a 24-hour job in reality, but it does feel like it. Only other item would be that due to the size of the teams, staffing is sometimes difficult without enough bodies to fill in.

Messy,1.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Endless funds to spend on the residents and staff, there's apparently no max to the party budget","Management doesn't care about Fair Housing or EEOC at all. There's a huge problem with fraternization. Lots of hooking up, drinking, and partying with the residents. Staff members get really cliquey with residents and are unable to impartially implement Fair Housing. One resident sexually harassed another resident at the pool, and when the victim complained, the manager said the victim was being sensitive and not understanding the perpetrator's humor (she was friends with perp). She refused to file an incident report. One teammate was regularly hooking up with a resident who was going through Eviction. It's unethical and convoluted. The exposure for a lawsuit is crazy high. It's like going back to high school in the worst way. If you don't go along with the status quo, you're told you're not a ""culture fit"" and your teammates will shun you like in The Crucible.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Industry Leader,5.0,"Feb 23, 2021","When I reflect on my time with Centerspace I can say with complete confidence that this company has helped me grow into a strong leader, mentor and really pathed my way to the successes I have experienced. They have a strong sense of their one team mantra and are adaptable to change laying the path to becoming a industry leader in property management. They took any obstacle over this last year and turned it into a learning experience, kept a positive outlook on every situation and really supported their employees through the ever changing times. I’m speaking out of first hand knowledge being at our Urban properties during COVID and the Civil Unrest in the communities my properties are in, they made the residents and employees safety and care a first priority. They made their appreciation known through listening to what we needed and what residents needed and acted on it instead of only thinking about the bottom line. The ability to work for such a excellent leadership team has shown me what working for a company should be, you should have work/life balance and time off, you should be heard and cared for and most importantly you should have the opportunity to grow and be given opportunities to show your passion, Centerspace gives you all of that and more.",There are none I can point out.,Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Unvalued employee,1.0,"Apr 10, 2018","Some positives would be the good hours, stable` pay, and the insurance. I love my residents so much and they are the only reason that I have been able to last this long in such a toxic environment.","It does not matter how hard you work, you will NEVER be recognized for it. They say they hire up within the company, however I have seen on numerous occasions, perfectly qualified, hard workers not even being considered with no good reason as to why. Corporate, upper management is completely untouchable, it does not matter what they do or how they treat people, nothing will ever change. I have seen employee turnover after turnover because of the regional manager and it doesn't seem to be looked at. It has been made very clear to everyone currently employed under them that nothing will change, and we have been told to go ahead and find a new job. IRET does NOT care about their employees in any way shape or form. They also do not offer a very high discount on rent, considering most property management companies offer free housing to employees. The pay is also considerably lower than competing properties. It has been empty promise, after promise.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Not stable,3.0,"Jul 3, 2019",The environment is good. If your full time the benefits are good too. I like that there is nothing after 6pm and nothing on sundays.,"The company is forever changing. They’ve implemented so many different things since I started. All which require online training. But they only give a week or two until something happens. You could be gone on vacation and come back and everything is different. They also claim to value costumer service, but between management being rude to residents all the time, the constant price hikes in amenities (garages going up 40% in one year), and only covering heat instead of any other utilities is obvious they are only interested in making money. Also, if you’re part time, your benefits suck. Only the discount of rent. Nothing else.",Centerspace,CSR,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Opportunities abound with this company, and they are always on the look out for people with a “can do” attitude.

Poor Manager,1.0,"Feb 4, 2013","Some good, engaged people at corporate but much apathy and laziness exists within this company","I guess I should have been more concerned during my interview when my future manager said ""one thing this company doesn't do well is train people"". I assumed she would train me but evidently she couldn't be bothered. I don't know if it is a regional problem in Billings or it is the culture throughout the company but IRET Properties does not treat its people well.

Mismanagement,1.0,"Dec 26, 2018",I will have to say that Pay is a factor to accepting a position with IRET.,"It may not be for each location, but mismanagement is a massive factor in my location. One thing is said to one employee, another is said to the next employee across the office; information essential to job performance is not given to be passed along to residents asking questions. Micro-managing is a culture practiced to full extent and there is an atmosphere of dictator, my-way-or-the-highway attitude. Training is null and I am lost in the realm of this money-hungry company. I could perform my duties much better if I had adequate training.

I will always recommend IRET,5.0,"Sep 10, 2020",IRET genuinely cares about their employees and their families. They took every precaution when COVID 19 had started and continues to do so. They allowed their teams to work remotely. They've made their voice clear regarding justice and equality. I am so proud to be able to work for a company that is so passionate in standing for what is right. They also even give out quarterly bonuses + even random ones. The senior team is very involved and you feel like a work family. Their training is extremely thorough and hands on. You will feel very confident jumping in after training. There is plenty of room to grow within the company and even to transfer out of state. I cannot recommend IRET enough!,You may have to work some nights or weekends.

I’m approaching a 1 year anniversary with this company and am extremely satisfied with my decision of employment.",Dealing with angry tenants has its downside and in my opinion is the hardest part of the job.

Dead End Job with Poor Management,2.0,"Jun 20, 2014","My coworkers are some of the best people around, but sadly are one of the only positive things about working for this company.","There is little to no room for advancement within the company. At times when more advanced positions have been open they have tended to hire outside the company rather than giving opportunity to existing staff members. Benefits have been slashed and salary is below market. Work as hard as you like, but there is little chance you will be recognized for it. Your reward will be yet more work, but with no pay increase.

You don’t have the ability to provide your own input or feedback. There is no room for growth within the company because they fill all the positions with people from outside the company that know someone. Your hard work is never recognized, no matter how dedicated you are to the company. You get little to no say in your budget, even though you are on expected to run the property. They also continually pile more work on you and don’t offer adequate staffing. Regional managers are non existent, they “work from home” and are rarely available.

I was emotionally neglected by the boss that hired me, bulldozed by my on-site management, and was publicly humiliated by the head bosses that hired me. As a queer person, I figured this was the most progressive company I could work for in the area. I never anticipated that not only would I be shunned, but publicly humiliated by the team that hired me after I turned in my notice. I would hire an attorney if I had the time and energy to fight the lawsuit. Turns out? I wasn’t the only one with bad experience. There’s a clear pattern.

If you say anything negative you ""don't believe in the product"". They don't trust site teams to do what needs to be done so they gatekeep everything and prolong any necessary process.

3 Year Analyst Program - Great foundation,5.0,"Apr 15, 2016",I went through DRH's 3 year analyst program after graduating from undergrad. It was a great place to start my career and build a foundation of knowledge in the hospitality / real estate industry. Upper management took an active interest in my development and got me involved in multiple facets of the company. Loved the team environment. Exit opportunities were solid and the C-level execs were very helpful with advice and recommendations when my analyst program was coming to an end.,Nothing major comes to mind.

Diamond Rocks!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2016","DiamondRock is a real estate company focused on the hospitality industry. The basic function of the company, to own hotels, is an exciting premise. I mean, who wouldn’t want an occupation that is the real-life equivalent of the Monopoly Man? The hotel business is an industry that is rooted in taking care of hotels that, in turn, take care of employees and travelers. It is an industry that has a meaningful impact on the daily lives of many people. The company is very well organized and operations run smoothly. The team is talented and motivated, with employees working hard to continue to help grow the company. DiamondRock is also a responsible corporate citizen and a great member of the Bethesda community by offering opportunities for employees to participate in local community service initiatives (also, read on to discover my notes about Bethesda later). The executives of the company are very approachable. The company prides itself on good communication, and it is easy to speak with the company’s key leaders. The executives make it a priority to ensure that all employees are aware of major directives, projects and goals. Also, the executives have an open door policy for questions, which is pretty cool. Now on to the important stuff. There is a snack room with unlimited, bottomless, snacks and soda (at least three types of pretzels at all times)! If you want to set a new personal best for afternoon soda consumption, there will be nothing stopping you. There’s even a really high-tech coffee machine that I’m convinced you can only operate if your previous employer was NASA. Also, there are a variety of entertaining informal and formal social events that help employees get to know each other in a more informal setting. And now to address a slightly controversial topic, the office’s location in Bethesda. Since the good folks at Glassdoor.com do not have a category for items that have both positive and negative attributes (NOTE TO GLASSDOOR: create a category for things that are boths pro's and con's), I’m placing this squarely into the positive attribute category. Pro because there are many hospitality industry companies in Bethesda, which creates a lot of networking opportunities. Pro because DiamondRock’s office occupies the best location in Bethesda, right on top of the Bethesda Metro Station (Red Line), and within three blocks of about 100 shops and restaurants (note, this is an approximate count and probably cannot be relied upon as an official statistic). Con because you are not in city-center Washington, DC. Bethesda is a small city where the majority of the workforce departs the area after the workday has concluded. However, Bethesda does have its perks if you need to finish up some last minute holiday shopping, replace an I-phone that you recently dropped while swimming in a lake, or find a tailor to mend your suit because your best friend decided to elope and only provided you with three days’ notice (it happened).","Although DiamondRock is a mid-cap public company traded on the NYSE, the workforce does not consist of that many people. Choosing to work at a small versus a large company is a lot like choosing to attend a liberal arts college or venture to State U. At a small college, everybody knows your name while at a large school you have the benefit of complete anonymity until a professor finally inquires where you have been all semester. Just note that at DiamondRock you won’t find an internal intranet with postings for 500 open positions, but you also won’t be required to attend a two-month training program at some spooky Upstate New York corporate campus.",DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
Three Year Analyst Program,5.0,"May 3, 2016",Amazing leadership and professional development in the three year analyst program!

Smoke and Mirrors... be careful,1.0,"Oct 28, 2025",There weren't too many things I liked about the organization other than meeting some cool people. The bright minds tended to be younger and most often would leave eventually. The salary was competitive... but benefits were pretty meh.,"Probably the most bizarre place I've ever worked. The constant stress of project deadlines that were deemed urgent, micro-managers and directors, executives being extremely toxic and overall just a weird sense of everyone being on edge at all times. They say they care about employee well being, but in the end most of the people that stay for more than a few years are just 'yes' people who play the corporate game. Most of the bright young minds leave after a few years (rightfully so) I often had to bite my tongue in response to how my manager and director would speak to me when something wasn't working as expected. The WFH is a joke.. they say 6 days a month but that comes with caveats... no 2 days in a row, has to have manager approval, can't come before a holiday or after a weekend... it wasn't flexible at all. Additionally, every team is extremely under-staffed... the amount of project requests that would come in.. the team I worked within never had enough time to complete anything with real quality, as it was a mad rush to get it out the door. The firm was extremely wary of hiring more people, yet executive level salaries were insane... just food for thought. Unless you are unemployed or have no other job prospects, I'd carefully consider other opportunities. Obviously everyone's experience is different.. but in a nutshell this was the worst place I ever worked at (my perspective)",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Good Entry Level Job,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Benefits are (were) the best I've experienced in the industry. Plus it's cool to say you work for the company that owns the ""world's most famous building"".","So, I've had the privilege of working at a worse company and a company on par with (or a little better than) ESRT. If you're right out of college, looking for an entry level property management job to spend a couple of years at to get your resume going (because you will not get promoted, not matter how good you are. Rewarding good work or hiring from within is not their jam) you could do worse. The benefits are really good, actually. Although, they changed their bonus structure in order to deny or lower bonuses arbitrarily and they switched their insurance to a lower quality one right as I left, so I can't speak to how the benefits are now. Bottom line--you have to remember that this is a corporation in AMERICA, of all places. They don't care about you beyond if you're losing or making them money, no matter how many free bagel days or lunches they give you. At the end of the day, they will sell your building to make a buck and kick you to the curb with a backdated termination letter (so that they don't have to pay for your insurance, of course), a callous denial of severance (even though they gave all other buildings severance before you), and not even a thank you or goodbye meal (upper management didn't even email the people whose lives they were upending despite knowing them for 10+ years), whether you've worked there for 2 years or 20. In fact, you're probably treated better if you've only been there for 2 years because the CEO or whatever his nepo baby title is has some kind of obsession with Gen Z and doesn't respect lifers. And everyone is TERRIFIED of him so no one will fight on your behalf if they risk going against him. So, yeah. It's a fine place to work if you don't expect to get a lot out of it. You get good experience and meet good people but you'll most likely get stuck in your position with no hope of upward mobility.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

Incompetent, incapable, and completely useless. The HR department experienced nearly 100% turnover since 2015. Everyone with talent in that department left. Pay increases, bonuses and payroll is horrendous and run by an incompetent manager. There is a huge lack of union and employee knowledge within the HR department.

Growth In the Right Direction,4.0,"May 10, 2019","I've been with ESRT for about a year now, serving in a variety of different capacities that have allowed me to witness multiple facets of what it's like to be an employee here. In my experience, there are two pros that stand out the most that have made it a great place to work for me: 1. A Challenging Environment - As mentioned in some of the other reviews here, when you put yourself out there at ESRT, you are rewarded with increasing professional and educational opportunities. I have found that management has consistently challenged me to go above and beyond and learn new things in my professional life. I've been given the opportunity to take great initiative on projects despite not being here for that long, simply because I've spoken up about wanting to be more involved. There are many opportunities for growth here at ESRT and professional improvement is actively encouraged by management. I have yet to be bored here. Obviously, this can vary by department, but I can say that I have been met with overwhelming support and encouragement from management in my department to grow professionally since I started here. 2. Increasingly Receptive Management - I have played witness to a good amount of institutional change here over the last year, all of which has ultimately been very encouraging to see as an employee. Management has been making an increasing effort to listen and respond to the concerns and desires of employees, which has manifested in a steadily growing number of ""office perks"" and the founding of a Culture Committee, as well as a general feeling of an overall culture shift within the organization as management learns to be a bit more relaxed and open to trying new things. Within the span of a year, I feel like management has gone from being very stuffy, close-minded, and out-of-touch to really being in touch with employees and actively engaged in finding new ways to improve the experience of working here at ESRT, which has been great to see and very reassuring. Aside from the aforementioned, I have also had a very positive experience with the work environment itself, and the people who work here. The job respects a work-life balance, the people are incredibly friendly and passionate about what they do, and the office itself is very upscale and conducive to collaboration and interaction among employees. I really do enjoy coming here every day!","Despite its recent progress, the organization is still very reliant on a top-down style of management which has allowed a very bureaucratic environment to thrive. My main frustrations with working here stem from: 1. A Heavy Dependence on Email - My inbox is inundated around the clock thanks to a culture of reliance on email as a primary mode of communication. Slack is not a universally-used application in our office, nor do we use any other sort of IM service for communication. I think this is definitely something that could be improved on in order to reduce inbox clutter and increase efficiency. 2. Lengthy Approval Processes - As I said above, the bureaucracy of the organization is most apparent when trying to accomplish tasks that require several levels of approval. It is understandable to have procedures in place to reduce the company's liability, however there is a such thing as too much. It is not uncommon to spend a great amount of time on a project only for it to be stymied by lengthy approval processes.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Good Pay / Bad Vibes,2.0,"May 26, 2022",Great pay and benefits package,Hosts are undervalued and treated as replaceable. There aren’t any options for progression.

Tyrannical Totalitarianism at its Best!,1.0,"Jun 10, 2015","Culture, what culture? If tyrannical totalitarianism is the culture you are striving for, this is the company to work for! The individuals working at the Empire State Building and its Observatory are some of the most talented professionals in the industry. Their other properties... not so much.","HR, like most professions, values ethical principles. People are the most important asset of an organization but also its biggest potential liability. One would assume that HR is ethically responsible for promoting and fostering fairness and justice for all employees throughout the organization; however, ESRT’s disparate, discriminatory, and retaliatory practices make HR’s position within the organization obsolete. The greatest liabilities in the organization are the individuals in charge of running it. The top-heavy tyrannical executive office is compiled of “bosses” not “leaders” (all of whom hate each other and refuse to communicate with each other). As Human Capital professionals and culture champions, you know something is deeply wrong with an organization when 80% of the HR department leaves in 6 months to go work for the company’s biggest competitors. The executive office chalks employee resignations up to those resigning as being “bad employees”. If resignations were coming from “bad employees”, I doubt your competitors would be hiring them at double their salaries. When resigning, expect to get shunned from senior management. It is pointless to put in 2 weeks’ notice. During the notice period, not a single person on the senior management team acknowledges your existence. My advice to existing staff is – Get out while you still have what’s left of your morals and dignity. Competitors are looking for your talent and are willing to equitability compensate you for it. My advice to prospective employees is – Unless you’re taking a position making $300K+ a year, its best to keep it moving. Even at $300K a year, employees are dropping like flies.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

Toxic with High Turnover - Stay Away,1.0,"Sep 27, 2014","Attractive Galleria location. Frequent ""Ordering-In"" of dinner (explained below), and jean fridays.","Extremely high turnover in the Accounting / Finance area (especially Corporate office). No work life balance. Unfortunately, accomplishment is measured on how many hours you put in (not the actual work performed). Dinner is ordered in just about every night and it's a big deal if you leave before 7pm (this is considered early). Employee morale is as low as I've witnessed at any organization of this size. Most people who are still hanging around are just waiting for their share grants to vest before they bolt. The joke of the place is that it's akin to Shawshank Prison (yes the movie). Existing employees actually joke when they see new hires join the team as they take bets on how many weeks the new person will last. **Last note - the financial systems are disjointed relics of the past. Running legacy software that is over 15 years old. It's really nothing short of a circus. If you are a candidate thinking of joining HHC, join at your own risk. My advice would be to make sure you ask them very detailed questions during the interview (and don't accept an offer until they let you interview with a couple peer level employees). Ask them pointed questions about the high rate of turnover (i.e.make them explain and defend it).

The lack of processes (or illogical ones with 15 hoops to jump through) has crippled execution. When you are new, or even have been there for several years, and ask what certain processes are, you just get shoved around to several different departments with no definitive answer. Senior leadership needs to step up and set these in place.

Any attempt at departmental leadership comes off as clearly feigned and people are set up to fail constantly. Tonally it feels like you're working in finance and any perks of the office being pretty is clearly for clients, not employees.

"Started Good, Ended Poorly",3.0,"Mar 18, 2021","Overall I would say I am grateful for the time and learning experiences I had at Howard Hughes. I was able to work on some pretty extensive projects and collaborate with people all across the company. I am grateful for my manager, they made working at HHC fun and always did their best to advocate for our team. Before the pandemic, I was able to travel quite a lot both for work and training. During my time there I also connected with a handful of pretty amazing people who genuinely wanted to make a difference in the world.","When I first started at Howard Hughes I was over the moon excited. I was experiencing that ""honeymoon phase"" at a new job where everything is just amazing. However, that started to fade out as I soon realized that actions spoke louder than words. The main reason why I left was that I was looking for career growth. My current role was not providing me the room to expand my experience or push my skill set to the max. Another reason I left was I essentially lived in fear of losing my job for over a year and a half for many reasons and to no fault of my own. – In June 2019 the company wanted to be purchased which meant looming potential layoffs if we merged with another company. – When no one wanted to buy the company they did a round of layoffs just before Thanksgiving and another just before the Holidays. – In March 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 they did another round of layoffs. I was fortunate to survive 3 rounds of layoffs, but it was scary waking up every day not knowing if I was next. Lastly, the culture is not what it is promised to be. Politics and Cliques run deep on every level in almost every region, and not just with senior leadership.

To add insult to injury, attached to the email was instructions on how to apply for food stamps. This is typical of operations of this company. The white, male leadership makes unilateral, ill-advised decisions without regard for the advice of those hired to help them steer the company in the right direction. Middle management acts as a barrier between the employees and leadership. Communication is a failure at every level: meetings are held to distribute old, contradictory, or useless information, while useful information is kept secret and employees are challenged to prove why they need critical details to do their jobs. Meanwhile, the nepotistic patriarchy is kept alive and well by creating special positions for the sons of white leadership. Well-designed lip service is paid to social causes on social media (when the lawyers and financial projections have determined it’s safe) but take a look at the leadership – that will speak louder than any pretty, convenient words.

As far as my department, i feel like i got pretty lucky. I enjoy working in my teammates and I appreciate their patience with teaching me and showing me new things.

Innovative leader in commercial real estate.",Leadership requires all 300+ employees to risk their health to go into the office unnecessarily 2x per week during the pandemic even though many employees have demonstrated they can do their work well from home. They repeatedly doubled down on this policy even after employees were exposed to numerous confirmed COVID cases at company offices. Very disappointing for a company that supposedly prides itself on how it takes care of employees.,"Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm
Great company to work for with amazing benefits,4.0,"Jan 5, 2022",I worked with an awesome team and an awesome boss. Everyone was very supportive. HPP is very busy with lots going on all the time so any role will be very fulfilling. Upper management listens and values feedback (even from the way down). They're still growing so thoughtful input is always appreciated. Lots of positive changes made in terms of benefits and offerings so I was grateful for that.,"I know they're working on this but diversity in the upper management is still a factor.

Counterpoint to the other reviews...,5.0,"Dec 14, 2015","Hudson knows how to treat their employees. Generous perks, benefits, etc. Contrary to other reviews listed here, the company provides ample opportunities for advancement and treats it's employees well. I have found the HR team to be responsive and fair. Overall, the executive team is top-notch and very skilled at what they do.","As with most growing companies, the expectation can lean towards long hours at times.

A start-up tech feel in a modern corporate culture,5.0,"Jun 17, 2016","The crux with sites like this is that everyone who is disgruntled or out for revenge is so quick to take to the “interweb” and air their grievances. Like Festivus is actually a real thing and they are so cleaver to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes and show how they were made a victim. In my lifetime of work experience, there’s always a valid reason why people are listed as “former” employees. A valid reason. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, perfectly happy, content employees are too busy doing their jobs to feel the need to broadcast to the world of how great they truly have it. Perhaps that’s a mistake on our part. One I intend to correct immediately. Hudson is not perfect. I have never met anyone here who has claimed otherwise. But, I have known that this company was special from the moment I stepped foot onto their property. Contrary to urban myth, there has never been a table of Kool-Aid set up for all new employees to drink. They don’t need to. The Kool-Aid is in the way the company is run, from the top-down. Open door policy? Check. Work-life balance? Check. Recognizing an employee’s commitment to go above and beyond? Check. Collaborative work force? Check. Perks? Check. Ability to grow? Check. I could go on and on here, but I think you get the picture. Hudson also has a very progressive mentality regarding change. They are not afraid to embrace it. Knowing that the past trends of the urban workforce may not be the most productive will never be set in stone with this company. The CEO is open to new things and excited to implement them. Like any job, I have my good days and my bad days. But, overall, they are mostly good and I’m incredibly fortunate and happy to be employed at Hudson.","It’s always a slippery slope when this subject is brought up, but there’s definitely a discrepancy in the XX to XY chromosome ratio in the senior management team. But let me clarify my, ahem, ""criticism"" for a moment. The current senior management team is comprised of amazing people with incredible talent who are truly shining stars in their respective roles. I don’t want to see more women in senior management to just fill a void. I also don’t want to see Hudson labeled as a “Boys Club” because it’s so much more than that. I want strong, intelligent and capable women to take more senior leadership roles alongside the current male heads of state.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

"Nice perks, bad management & HR",2.0,"Jun 16, 2017","Free lunches, free breakfast, good benefits, half day Fridays.","Hiring new people is a mess. They hire friends of management and executives, who don't actually want to work there, but get ridiculously high salaries. People who have been there for 10+ years have the job because they were there from the beginning, not because they are amazing employees. All of the interns that were hired were family or friends of executives, making it a nightmare to manage. TOTAL Boys club. Not many women can work there way to the top at HPP. HR is a disaster. Terrible, terrible HR staff. I've seen better HR management at small start-ups. There is no 'Open door policy' here, even though they want you to think there is. If you tell HR any concerns, they'll use it against you. If you're having any other issues, they will simply ignore you and not deal with situations. If there are any employees that are not meeting company standards, they simple demote them, and move them around the office, making the morale and work flow even worse. They do not know how to handle any problems or sticky situations, they'd rather ignore and cover it up with bandaids. Employee retention not great. A lot of turn over due to the extremely slow promotion rate. Again, you can get a promotion here easily if you know someone, if you are a ""random"" hire , hire based on skills and resume, most likely you will stay in your position for a very long time. Management is a mess, very toxic environment. If you're not a manager, it is VERY well known you're not. ie: ""retreats"", lots of closed door meetings, lots of management outings, and the lower level employees are not appreciated.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

The company has a strong market position with a diversified asset class and cares about being a leader in sustainability. In terms of life at Hudson Pacific, there are a lot of 'work perks' that come with the job.

Best in Class,5.0,"Jun 27, 2016","I've been with this company for a few years and watched it grow from having fewer than 50 employees in LA to a team of 250+ across a portfolio in major cities up and down the West Coast. Leadership has managed to keep priorities consistent over time -- they stress teamwork, collaboration and hard work, all while underscoring the importance of having fun together, and, of course, delivering best in class product and client service. Which, if you ask me, is about the most satisfying combination of goals for a company to tout. And they don't just talk the talk; the perqs of working at Hudson include state of the art work spaces, company outings, summer half day Fridays, stocked kitchens, catered lunches, and just about any other amenity you could want. All of it, of course, is designed to make the average employee feel as happy at work as possible, because Hudson gets it: happy employees = productive employees. I honestly can't speak to the experiences some have had regarding cliques and power, but I would not be the least bit surprised if the folks writing those reviews had some of their own issues going on. There will always be naysayers, but if you ask the average Hudson employee to give you a candid assessment of working here, I'd be surprised if you didn't get a completely positive, hopeful report. Not to mention that because there is such a premium on corporate culture and vision, recruiting is careful to select individuals who clearly embody the qualities mentioned above. No workplace is perfect, but as far as I can tell, this one comes about as close as you can get.",No drawbacks to report -- it is an honor to work (and play) here!,"Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

"Good from far, far from good",1.0,"Sep 13, 2018",The corporate office space is brand new and really nice. They have a kitchen with free food and drinks. On the surface it's a pretty cool place to work.,"1) The vast majority of the most important people at Hudson either worked with the CEO at his previous company or had some other pre-existing relationship. The board is an old boys' club and so is most of the executive team. As such, the culture at the top is very insular and that has negative effects for new employees and people at the bottom. 2) Company-wide communication is pretty much non-existent; there were at least a half dozen instances in which they bought a new building or sold an existing building but never bothered to tell any of the people who weren't directly involved with the transaction. Most employees didn't find out until reading the press releases. 3) If you run into any kind of HR issue that negatively affects your work and you don't have any ""friends at the top"" then my sincere advice is this: skip the HR department and start looking for an escape route. I watched multiple people try to make formal complaints about harassment, retaliation, etc and not only was there no action taken, the HR department didn't even bother to write anything down or pretend to investigate. I'm actually being pretty diplomatic - the reality is that there are some unprofessional, toxic people working at various levels of the company and HR actively enables them through some combination of malice and incompetence. I imagine it's only a matter of time before the company gets hit with a harassment or discrimination lawsuit, if it hasn't already.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

If you want to move up you must brown nose and show face in the office after hours and on weekends. Quantity of hours is more important than quality of work. Environment is competitive and toxic, resulting in high turnover of staff. Employees at the next level down avoid making decisions and prefer to throw their own team under the bus than to stick up for them.

It's very transparent what teams and departments are valued (i.e. asset management is a priority, accounting is not, etc.) and if you're not in one of the favored departments you won't have any room for growth. The only way to get your value recognized is to a) be a favorite of the executive over your department or b) threaten to leave. Communication between departments is abysmal. You'll be overworked and severely underpaid. Your work life balance depends on your manager; some are better than others.

Borderline Fair Housing violations were common in bad practices that allowed opportunities for some residents and not others in obscure “customer service gestures”. Over time, management implemented a cycle of requiring lower staff to enforce policies that they would then waive entirely when speaking to residents themselves, as if to deliberately make subordinate staff appear incompetent, uncaring, and mean in the eyes of residents. This created an environment in which constant negative reviews for leasing staff diminished any possibility of upward mobility no matter how strong their work ethic or sales skills.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

Pay is not worth it for the treatment you get here. The job itself is very overwhelming because they expect you to do your job while doing the job of others (in this case management) In my time here, I had seen two employers had breakdowns and walk out the job.

Fantastic Entry-Level Job,5.0,"Aug 25, 2020","Corporate has an awesome atmosphere, everyone is motivated, energetic, and ambitious. Great learning opportunities, and obvious room for growth/promotion since the company is rapidly growing/expanding. Coming from a company with a weak HR department, it's also refreshing to see that HR is responsive/actively reaches out to ensure that your transition is going well (for example, they have sent everyone 2 gift-baskets in the last 2 months during WFH!) Benefits/pay are also wonderful. Stock discount/401K matching is competitive, and healthcare/dental/vision is very affordable. Tuition reimbursement is also one of the highest in DC, plus the new office is unbelievable. Note to individuals considering JBG Smith: please remember that many of these reviews are from property staff, not from corporate staff. Not to discount property staff's experiences working for JBG Smith, but the corporate work experience is obviously going to be different than the property staff work experience.

Supposedly there's an annual booze cruise in October, but I'm guessing that is cancelled due to the pandemic. Either way, it could be nice if the company offered smaller virtual social events to get to know fellow co-workers/individuals in different departments since we aren't returning to the office until Spring. The only real ""con"" is that unlike other major REITS in the DC area (Avalon Bay Communities, etc.), JBG Smith does not offer an employee rent discount on company owned properties (but I can also see why so this isn't a real con and more of a wish). That said, with DC housing prices skyrocketing, I could easily see myself jumping to a REIT that offers such a program in the future if such an opportunity arose (just since rent is so expensive/huge part of any person living in DC's budget)",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

Within accounting, they are implementing new software that should make close more efficient and free up some time, however: - Regardless of how efficient they get, it seems expected that you will still have to work a ton to meet your deadlines. Throughout busy season, you'll have at least a couple of late nights per week on average, and will have to work on some weekends in order to meet close deadlines. - The accounting department has grown so much that advancement is becoming a bit more difficult.

I love working for JBG SMITH,5.0,"Apr 14, 2022","In my experience, JBG is an honest company and my morals align closely with their Core Values. I love that they are actively working to make housing affordable for those in need and they support other groups through JBG Cares. As a Residential employee, I really enjoy working with my direct supervisor and believe they would go to bat for me in just about any situation. I want to perform at a higher level because of them. JBG SMITH put a lot of thought and effort info how they operated through the pandemic. They took a conservative approach to re-opening which was difficult at times, but was ultimately for the health and wellbeing of its employees and customers. JBG paid team members that worked on site ""Hazard Pay"" in relation to COVID for about a year. All JBG employees working at the property level were eligible and we were automatically paid $3.50/hr in addition to their hourly wage. This was almost a 20% raise for many front line employees in a very uncertain time. The benefits package is very solid. JBG contributes 50% of what I contribute toward my 401k -- up to 3%. I feel that my PTO and mental health are prioritized at JBG SMITH. We now have a Cultural Reflection day each year that can be used as an additional personal day with no questions asked. JBG was on top of Juneteenth becoming a Federal Holiday and within hours of the presidential announcement, we were notified that offices would be closed the following Monday in observance of this Holiday. JBG Residential gave site team members two extra personal days to use between 1/1/22 and 2/28/22 citing that the teams working on site had been resilient through the pandemic and they wanted us to take time to mentally prepare for the upcoming season. JBG SMITH sent employees multiple care packages throughout the pandemic with food/snacks, board games, and a notes from the executive team. Matt Kelly (CEO) created weekly videos and sent them to the entire company to talk to us about new things happening at JBG to keep the entire company clued into how things were going. He often encouraged team members to stay healthy and stay home as our health was most important. Health/Dental takes care of practically wherever I want to go (including Georgetown MedStar). I cannot say enough about how great JBG SMITH has been as an employer.",Residential Property Management is an industry that I personally believe should see some salary increases across the board.,JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

"Toxic environment, poor management, & lack of advancement",1.0,"Dec 19, 2021",The new office & decent benefits (unlimited PTO & good insurance coverage),"I’m surprised by the amount of positive on this company considering the large turnover it has experience over the last couple of years, and the turnover continues even more so recently since the merger. This company loses quality employees because it lacks proper training structures within teams, an actual career path for many employees who are not in either accounting or development (as they are treated much differently than other teams), nepotism, negative/toxic work culture, and lack of work/life balance. The churn and burn from their field employees are even worse than corporate. They’re often left on their own and feel forgotten, unsupported, and less than next to corporate employees. There’s zero room for growth and this company has made it known they will keep their employee base status quo. Their retention strategies are to either offer to transfer an employee or promote them when it is too late. I see reviews that make claims about the positive direction the company is taking on diversity but it STILL severely lacks that across their executive management on down. Most of the executive leadership are there to stay and that makes it hard for others to attain upward movement unless those at the top leave. Not to mention, the executives and senior managers perpetuate the toxic culture, which was carried over from pre-merger. You’re seeing turnover in development, accounting, marketing, and HR. Very concerning to me, but not surprised. The management overseeing these groups are who cultivated and continue to perpetuate the negativity and toxicity. I don’t expect that to change unless they leave. You’ll either be pushed out or reach your breaking point here. It’s not worth it, especially for the below market pay that you’re given for the lack of work life balance. I would be cautious when reading these very vague, scripted positive reviews as it doesn’t reflect the current turn over they’re experiencing. Talk to any employee who is currently at the company and those who have left because you will hear the truth behind what goes on and this company is not headed in a positive, upward direction. Sad since this company has potential but I don’t see it succeeding.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

"Toxic work environment, lack of advancement, poor management",1.0,"Jul 2, 2021",Office space (new) & healthcare benefits,"Extremely toxic work environment where employees are overworked, under appreciated, under paid, and treated poorly by their managers (particularly if you are in accounting and HR). Very much an ‘old boys club’ or ‘frat’ culture, especially in development where employees of this department act entitled, pretentious, and have overinflated egos because of their Ivy League degrees. Other departments have a ‘bully’ culture within their teams, showing favoritism and promoting inappropriate office behavior (I.e. gossip and poor treatment towards their employees). The accounting department has very high turnover, lacking proper management and training of their new employees. HR has had a lot of turnover since the change in their management. HR executives have replaced many long standing employees with their friends or colleagues from Marriott. Hiring and recruiting practices are questionable — a lot of favoritism and nepotism occur and are mostly driven by executives and managers who hire employees as a favor. Discrimination and biased hiring decisions happen often here (I.e. hiring managers give preference to candidates with Ivy League degrees or specific brick & mortar universities versus hiring a candidate based on skills and experience). Executives hire employees in secret and make drastic changes to their staff without notice, which creates distrust amongst their employees and reflects poor recruiting practices. Their recruiting team experienced high turnover and what once was a positive team that cared about their employees, has been replaced with employees who further perpetuate the toxic work culture and don’t seem to know what they’re doing. The company has made slight improvements to their diversity and inclusion when looking at their demographics, but there’s still a lack of female and minority representation at the executive and management level. For non-corporate positions — there is an extremely high turnover rate at the property sites. The company lacks competitive pay and strong work culture that extends to their field employees. This company doesn’t provide you with any advancement or a clear career path. Onboarding and training don’t exist. You will sink or swim. One day you’re ‘in’ the next day you are ‘out’ without warning. Don’t let the fancy new office space fool you, you’re better off at a company that is employee-centric with stronger values and ethics.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

A Dynamic Journey of Growth and Opportunity at Kilroy,5.0,"Jan 2, 2025","Culture and Environment: Kilroy promotes a friendly and creative workplace where everyone collaborates and shares ideas. The company value their employees, making it easy to communicate and build lasting friendships within the team. Career Development: One of the standout aspects of Kilroy is its commitment to employee growth. I was encouraged to pursue professional development opportunities. I’ve had the privilege of being promoted multiple times, and each step along the way was supported by my managers, who genuinely invested in my success. Work-Life Balance: Kilroy understands that life outside of work is just as important as the work we do. I appreciate that my well-being is a priority. Innovation and Impact: Kilroy is at the forefront of innovation and sustainable practices in our industry that positively impact our communities and the environment. It’s inspiring to be part of a team that prioritizes not just profitability, but also social responsibility.","While my experience at Kilroy has been overwhelmingly positive, there are a few areas that could use improvement: Workload Fluctuations: There are times when workload can get heavy. During these times, it is hard to balance work and life; and some team members may find it tough to keep up. Communication Gaps: While the open-door policy is great, there are times when departments don't communicate well. Keeping all teams updated on projects/tasks can help everyone work better together and improved efficiency.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

Negative Work Environment,2.0,"Jul 26, 2024","As a former employee who dedicated many years with the company, the SD region doesn’t shine like it used to. I’ve seen the region in its glory days when we had talented leaderships who were competent at their jobs. They were professional, reasonable, supportive, and treated everyone like family. There was growth and clear directions for the team. It was the place where everyone wants to be.","The current upper management is selective about who they want to promote. In the last several years, promotion has been based on favoritism vs performance. Employees who are dedicated and show up are often overlooked with little to no recognition. Asset managers would talk badly about their own teammates in front of others. You can hear them outside the office complaining loudly and not even trying to be discreet about it. Instead of fixing known issues, bad behaviors are often ignored and rewarded with constant praises and promotions which greatly affects office morale. Management is aware of the issues but instead of reporting it, some choose to jump on the bandwagon and disregard the problem, while others fear retaliation. High turnover of employees is a good indicator that there is a problem within the department.

Their default is now to put people on PIPs to “guide them” but they really just destroy morale with no actual feedback or path. No matter your role you are micromanaged to death and expected to run everything you do (literally every thing) by your manager. The lack of autonomy is inefficient and you’re left with Senior leadership who miss deadlines, don’t sign things for weeks, constantly canceling and rescheduling meetings. They will throw you under the bus to cover for their own inadequacies the first chance they get.

Tread carefully and proceed with caution,2.0,"Dec 12, 2024","As far as corporate America goes, Kite's probably pretty standard. There is nothing particularly extraordinary about them; they're not going to win ""best place to work"" anytime soon. The benefits at Kite are where it's at. While their base pay is subpar for the tenured employees, the bonus structure, benefits plans, stock options, PTO policy, and other fringe benefits are top-notch. There is a handful of amazing employees that go above and beyond for the team and company and will make the endless job so much more manageable. The financials and the numbers are good for Kite. They're a solid company with a secure future - number wise. If they don't shape up some of the personnel issues, the numbers might start suffering.","You will be overworked while they tout work/life balance in your face. They (meaning the Leadership group) like to run as lean as possible. And yes, while this saves overhead costs, it runs employees ragged. You're given an above average amount of PTO but will struggle to find time to use it without digging yourself a nearly impossible hole upon return. Good news is that if you're a bad employee, it's almost impossible for you to get terminated from your job. The phrase ""it's better to have a butt in the seat than a cold seat"" was said a few times. It's an awful mindset and kills the morale of your good employees. The salary discrepancy between tenured employees and new employees is in the stratosphere. New employees are hired in lightyears above tenured employees and yet they wonder why tenured employees are few and far between these days. The only fairly compensated tenured employees are those at the VP or higher level. There is a boys-club and the Employee Experience (HR) team doesn't aid in curbing this perception. There is clear favoritism towards the males at the company. The bulk of the Senior Leadership team is white males; there are only 3 women in the senior leadership team. The lack of overall diversity in the leadership team also can't go unmentioned. Be careful who you tell things to at Kite; nothing is kept secret. It's a gossip mill. NOTHING is sacred at Kite. If you're lucky, you'll find a little group who you can confide in but be cautious of the bulk of people. It's a dog-eat-dog environment at Kite and people will use things you've said against you in a heartbeat if they think it will get them ahead. After the merger in October 2021, the company more than doubled in size. This was primarily handled okay, but Kite's been unsuccessful in bringing some departments around to Kite protocol. Asset Management is the biggest issue in this front - the leadership, or lack thereof, needs revamping here. They're running amuck for the most part in that department; doing their own thing on their own timelines, not following SOPs, throwing bottlenecks into processes. And with no repercussions.",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm

The environment is so toxic you can't escape it unless you leave on your own terms or get terminated. The latter is more likely to happen if you don't ""play the game."" Employee's want to trust each other, but it's hard. You don't know who's been turned and will run and tell HR every word spoken. If you read many of these reviews you'll see a pattern relating to the HR department. I won't delve into it, but can verify it's factual. There is an extremely high rate of turnover at this company, for it's size it's unheard of. While I was employed there statistics showed over a 5 year period 150 people left the company.

Management is poor at Kite. Both upper and lower management. Upper management hides behind doors and doesn't value employees. Poor management and leadership in the Asset Management team. Lack of communication. Lots of favoritism. Both VP's of this department lack leadership. Not allowed to speak to upper management as you must go through the ""chain of command"". They tell you not to speak to upper management, instead you must go to your reporting supervisor. Said supervisor will stab you in the back and run to the VP's to throw you under the bus. Yearly goals are expected to be met. Though you don't receive your goals until mid-year. This company has too many people in management that shouldn't be in their position. Their are policies to follow, yet it seems to only apply to certain people. Let's talk about the HR department. It is horrid! The VP is the most cold-hearted, unfriendly, dreadful person to ever run an HR department. I've yet to meet one person that has anything nice to say about her. She will look you up and down with distaste, it is uncomfortable. Very unapproachable. Holds grudges. Eventually most employees with end up with a target on their back. Employee turnover is extremely high at this company. In all my years in the workforce, I've never seen a company with turnover of employees as this company has. I believe more people are terminated versus leaving on their own. It's sad that upper management can't see this and doesn't question it. No room for growth at this company.

Security,1.0,"Jun 10, 2014",All the Pro's left when Gene Thompson and Dennis Scott passed. They really understood what security is and the important role that they played within the company.,"All the security staff is poorly trained, underpaid and constantly under pressure by a spineless manager. Never willing to stand up for the employees and only siding with his wife who works within the mall. Which is a company violation (fraternizing with mall tenants). The work environment was so hostile that everybody was back stabbing each other at every turn. Management treated the security staff like 3rd rate janitors. Some of the security supervisors would show up drunk or start drinking while on the job! It took one property manager 4 months to finally introduce himself to the staff. During those 4 months he just walked around and complained about every single bad detail the mall had and how the staff failed to observe it. The only growth here, is to quickly grow out of this property into a better place. Better yet, dump security and grow into a REAL CAREER and never look back. Macerich will never be the same and this mall (Pavilion) will end up like the Hawthorne Plaza. Time Off policies? Well, everyone steals from the time clock because they sign it themselves. They also steal from the lost and found via manipulating the report information. You can't count on the employees there. They will back stab you. If you're not part of the ""click"", you're in for a hard time.

Based upon my experience, hostile working environment, not-so-great pay (not even really market competitive), micromanagement hell, heavy workload, few growth opportunities, upper management absolutely does not care about employees, high turnover. Typically there are layoffs every year in February like clockwork. I write all this not to be vindictive but in the hopes that someone gets some brutally honest information from a former employee’s perspective based upon their experience and that I help offer a good person some things to consider before making a decision to work there. Also, don’t believe what you read about ability to work from home. They are not flexible in that way. Raises and bonuses (if you get either) are done with extreme scrutiny and penny pinching even for the better employees.

They have no professionals in HR that stand up to the bullying managers found in most parts of the company. I have heard that within HR that employee treatment is the WORST! So many at SVP and VP level continue to manage like it's 1960. The executive management team has no use for the staff level employee, they are very self-motivated and barely know employee names.

One mistake, and they're quick to write you off and make you feel like garbage. Micro managing doesn't exist and if you ask a question, you get lectured.

The pay and location were also favorable.,Upper management was incredibly inept and it felt that a lot of people in top positions got there due to past friendships or family connections.

Used to be a GREAT place to build a career,3.0,"Feb 1, 2015","The dept where I worked was full of mostly great people. There was a real team mentality and support from the C-suite down. The Westcor team always seemed to try and maintain the values and culture to keep the Macerich culture of kill or be killed at bay. If you worked in IT, the rest of the company trusted and believed in you to get things done. They really listened to the voice of the customer.","Some within the team were rsther backstabbing and/or just plain incompetent. Yet, they were kept on because they hoodwinked the manager into liking them. Some managers and up should have never gotten the position they were given. It's just that some senior personnel get too attached and won't fire them. Some of those people and managers are still there today. The Macerich culture is what has ruined the brand, overall. The flippant nature of direction, without sharing with and empowering employees to make it reality, yet holding them accountable, has driven the company into a hole. I believe Macerich will end up being taken over by the likes of Simon or GGP within the decade, as they continue to back themselves into a smaller and smaller footprint to the point of irrelevancy. HR is a complete joke. One HR senior person brags of her augmentation, yet removes good people on the flimsiest of circumstances.

The only people that are promoted are 95% men and only if they are friends with the CEO's or executives. There are many work environment issues such as bullying and harassment. I experienced harassment at this company after 1 year working for Macerich. Nothing happens to the people that causes problems. Even if you complain. I complained of harassment to my boss and he assured me that it was reported to corporate.

"Good corporate vision, but management needs more oversight.",2.0,"Apr 25, 2016","They pay was a bit above average for the position. IT is available for any help you need. Some staff that have been there a long time balance out the whole office. The leasing staff was friendly despite having a lot going on. I liked working with guest services, they are huge asset, and keep a great relationship with the stores that management is ignoring. The maintenance staff was also great, they did their jobs and their management had a great work ethic and understanding of the property.","Working at Broadway Plaza was a negative professional experience. The environment is negative, management projects an image of perfection and kindness to the staff and the store managers, but their own agenda and expectations are the first priority. When people considered “important” would visit our site, the expectations of perfection by property management were unrealistic. If someone in the office made a mistake during one of those visits, they would be shunned. The other staff tiptoed around the upper property management in the office. I've worked at places with the CEO in the office, and they did not expect the treatment the property management of this location did. The middle managers in the office go back and forth from being great to treating the admin staff, guest services, security, housekeeping and valet management very poorly. I witnessed other employees cry, and another employee call in sick from the parking lot because she was afraid to come in. There were relations problems with the store managers that were not the big few in the mall. The management staff would spend a week planning a lunch with 2 people and ignore problems from the majority of store managers. Employees paid hourly were asked to work overtime without compensation on multiple occasions. When I and other co-workers asked to take time off to make up for unpaid overtime it was rarely given, and never offered. In addition, while working there I and other co-workers found it very difficult when we became ill. I understand the strain on co-workers and management when an employee goes through something like that, but I and other co-workers were met with zero understanding when it came to illness. I was threatened to be let go, despite not even coming close to using all allotted sick time. No, I would not recommend working here. The lack of opportunities for training and no outreach from HR about open positions makes the negative environment not worth it.",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

"A waste of my time... if I could do it over again, would not have taken the job.",1.0,"Oct 11, 2013","The co-CEOS of the firm mean well. I think they really want a company like Zappos, a company they went to visit to learn how they developed a positive work environment in a corporate world. That's about all the positive I can muster up. It was that bad.","While the co-CEOs mean well, the problems start at the top with the Partners, all the way down to the Managers, and into the HR department. The Partners play favorites, ignoring those they dislike or don't care about. They give you a fake smile and then talk behind your back. I think there was maybe 4-5 Partners throughout the firm that I met who actually were genuine, and really cared about their staff. The rest just use the staff to make themselves look good. The managers in this firm were a mix of good and bad. The bad being those who were abusive to staff. Everyone, including Partners and HR, knew about the reputations of the bad managers, but nothing was ever done. Why? Because the abusive managers brown nosed the partners, and of course, they were friends with everyone in HR. They knew the right people to befriend, so they would be untouchable. Shameful how they allowed people to be treated. The HR department is unable to keep their mouth shut, so if you have a real complaint, your best bet is to tough it out or find another job, because if you complain about them, they usually notify the offending party, and your life becomes hell then. I saw it happen to numerous people, so I knew better than to go to HR to complain about harassment. And forget about a career here. How can you have a career when the turnover rate is ridiculous, and on top of that is the massive layoffs every 2 years (they laid off nearly 7-8% of their staff (77 people) in May, while also having another 150-200 quit or get fired after the layoff (fired separately to avoid having the layoff number be higher than it already was).",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

Limited advancement potential for individuals in non revenue generating operational positions, as those departments tend to have a much leaner organizational structure - not to mention a constant battle to justify one's own existence through countless reports and metrics since you're not bringing in money.

If one of your managers are off you are expected to cover that store. if more than one is off you are expected to cover all of them. All your stores will have low staffing and few if any contengency managers. Culture is toxic overall. It is focused on accountability particularly for regional managers or below. The only excuse why something did not get completed is that you failed and nothing else matters. Need to be in 3 different places at once and work 16 plus hours days. Thats not an excuse not to get another thing done. They will send you out test asking you take a picture in front of an object in front of your store within 30 minutes to verify you are there. Upper management is obsessed with change. you will constantly get bombarded with new systems and processes. These are not veted before you get them so there will be bugs. Current push is mobility.

Only if you’re desperate for a job come here.,1.0,"Jan 23, 2024","The people are nice, and the pay is good. That’s really it.","So just a side note that is review only pertains to the Berkeley office. Other Outfront offices do things differently, so I can’t say anything about them. Unfortunately the general manager to this location isn’t that great. He’s a nice guy, however he’s very unpredictable and unprepared. He doesn’t have a good plan for new hires, and expects them to know everything on their first week. He also shuffles his employees around to several other people, and they’re not given a heads up from the GM on how to help them. He’s also not transparent, and will leave out a lot of important details during the job interviews. He also doesn’t allow some employees to do their jobs, and will do it himself instead of giving them a chance. The office itself is also not ready and still under construction. The GM doesn’t really care that the noise and debris is bothering some employees and expects them to still show up to work, even under uncomfortable circumstances. The ceilings and walls keep leaking from the rains, and it’s uncomfortable for some employees to work with. The building also isn’t really up to code, and it looks like they cut some corners. For example, if you have a disability you won’t be able to work upstairs with everyone else because there’s no elevator. You’ll have to stay downstairs where it’s freezing cold, and not handicap accessible. IT takes forever to assist you to help, and the laptops are kind of out date. Bonuses are hardly given out, and there’s really no perks offered. Quite a bit of turnover here, as well. And the benefits are super expensive. The company may pay a lot, but they also take a lot from your paychecks. Overall, I say if you’re still in need of a job, and the job market isn’t getting better, then apply here, but don’t stay too long.",OUTFRONT Media Inc.,OUT,Specialty,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Outfront-Media-Reviews-E930001.htm

Unprofessional and hostile work environment,1.0,"Aug 3, 2023",Competitive salary and decent benefits.,"I worked at OUTFRONT for three months. I wanted to share my experiences working for this company to help inform others considering working here. I was discharged from my cybersecurity position after just over three months of employment. I was given a performance review where I was given a plan to improve my performance. Then, less than a week later, I was terminated on the spot with no warning. My manager asked me for a quick ""chat."" When I joined the call, he told me someone else was joining, which I hadn't been informed of prior to the call. Then an HR representative joined the call and immediately told me I was being terminated. When they were about to end the call, I asked if I could give my input. They told me they don't usually allow employees being terminated to speak up, but I did anyway. I told them that it was unethical what they were doing and told them how I felt about my experiences. I then left the call. In my experience at OUTFRONT, I felt the work environment was unprofessional and hostile. My manager would regularly adopt a combative stance against everyone on calls and emails, he would regularly raise his voice and swear at us, say belittling comments to me about my work (e.g. criticize me for not rolling out a simulated phishing awareness campaign on time, despite him shelving the task for two years), and almost never gave any praise to anyone for their accomplishments. In my performance review, he criticized me for my self assessment in which I said I try hard to create an inclusive environment for all races, genders, religions, and creeds. However, he himself had not hired anyone except for white men. Out of the whole team of 15 or so people, we had 1 woman and fewer than 5 non-white employees. Despite claiming he had tried to create an inclusive environment, his team was composed overwhelmingly of white men. As a new employee fairly new in my career, I was given no chance whatsoever to improve my performance and grow in my career. I had never received any written or verbal warnings or detected any signs of disapproval from management for my performance. After my one and only performance review, I was falsely led to believe I would have tome to improve my performance. I felt I was in a cutthroat environment in which the communication between managers and engineers was lacking, good work was not praised, and every mistake was harshly criticized. I do not recommend working in this company to anyone. I was terminated right on the spot with no other job lined up and given no time whatsoever to improve my performance. I had no salary, no health benefits, and it took me months to find a new job to be able to support myself. It was an extremely upsetting and stressful experience for me and I an thankful I found a professional and respectful work environment afterwards.",OUTFRONT Media Inc.,OUT,Specialty,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Outfront-Media-Reviews-E930001.htm

Still About 40 years Behind - Both in Culture and Technology,2.0,"Apr 16, 2020",Salaried employees are paid pretty well. Good 401K benefits.

Management has absolutely zero interest in technology - even though they sure pretend to in pitch meetings to clients. Meanwhile, the inventory tracking system runs on a platform from the 80s. You literally open up to a black screen with a blinking neon green cursor. I feel like I might as well be in an SNL sketch. When I left at the end of 2019, they still did not even have Salesforce ... they said they were just about to launch it when I started in 2016. When the possibility of actually moving the company into the 21st century is raised to management there is a lot of push back from high level sales people who just feel more comfortable selling the same billboard the same way they've been selling it for the past 15 years.

Toxic Culture That Destroys Morale and Wellbeing,1.0,"Sep 11, 2025",One manager at the site level genuinely cared and tried to support their team. Talented coworkers who do their best despite the environment. Strong name recognition.,"This is not just a “high-pressure sales job.” It’s a culture built on fear, intimidation, and exhaustion. The division prioritizes metrics over people, and it shows in every aspect of the employee experience. Fear Over Feedback: Speaking up is dangerous. Employees who voice concerns are quickly labeled as negative or a “problem.” HR is not a safe option, and feedback sessions are tightly controlled to avoid real criticism. Unrealistic Metrics: Success is measured by spreadsheets, not actual effort or customer experience. Performance standards are punishing and often based on factors outside employees’ control. Call Distribution Games: Leads are not distributed evenly. Some get better calls while others are left with recycled, low-quality prospects—yet everyone is held to the same national targets. The system is fundamentally unfair. Health Toll: The stress here is extreme. Employees report anxiety, burnout, sleeplessness, and the feeling that work consumes their lives. The lack of acknowledgment from leadership only deepens the damage. Revolving Door: Turnover is constant. People leave burned out and disillusioned. Many return briefly out of necessity, only to leave again once they find something healthier.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

You’re thrown in blind and blamed when you sink. • Non-tenure lasts ~3 months. Sounds safe—until your last non-tenured month rolls over and drags down your first three months of tenure. You’re haunted by numbers you had no chance to escape. • Calls are a trap: you can lock as many as you want, but if they don’t fund, you’re accused of “costing the company” thousands. Instead of coaching, you get public shaming. • Leadership is chaos. Some managers hide, others panic, all live in fear. Genuine support is extinct. The culture is built on intimidation, finger-pointing, and fear. • Toxicity is woven into every metric. You can fund loans and still be told you’re failing. The system is designed to chew you up and spit you out. • Upcoming comp plan change—expect to work harder each year for less.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm
Wizard of OZ,1.0,"Sep 20, 2025","Stress, wrinkles and annoying managers","Working at PennyMac was a highly discouraging experience. The culture is heavily micromanaged, leaving little room for trust or autonomy. Compensation is below industry standards, and the workload is consistently overwhelming due to chronic understaffing. Employees are expected to take on far more than is reasonable, which quickly leads to burnout and frustration. Opportunities for career growth are minimal, and employee well-being doesn’t seem to be a priority.

Friendly and supportive management that let you play into your strengths and develop new skills.,"Very pushy on the in office collaboration and resistance of remote and hybrid options. Culture is very college fraternity/sorority feeling. Very slow at pay raises. There are no yearly cost of living or merit raises only ""market adjustments"" every 2-3 years. Bonuses are capped at a certain percentage. So even if you do go ""above and beyond"" you get the same bonus as your slacker teammate. The mortgage industry is very feast or famine. I survived 2 layoffs at the beginning and then working a skeleton crews until rates got better. In busy season management tends to give all resources and energy to new hires and leaves more senior people to figure things out on there own.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm
Upper Management is too much,3.0,"Sep 25, 2024",The people here are great and mostly all of us get along.,"Upper management has turned into control freaks. Employees are judged and viewed based on numbers on a screen but not the quality of their work. Most departments have to report to the office every day. Some still have hybrid, but if you utilize their hybrid schedule you will get scolded and will have it used against you if you want a promotion or raise (not that they’d give you one anyways). The company has a whole has a “control” problem where they have this old school mentality of wanting to control people. They will find every excuse in the book to delay and put off raises/promotions, but will swing and change an entire organization over night. They will constantly tell you why they “can’t” do things that would benefit the employee, but will change the entire dynamic of the department on a moments notice when it does t benefit the employees.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

You miss one word and you are hit with a critical fail, which not only places you in the termination pile-but the company then keeps your commission on that loan when it funds.

"Training is horrible, access to data takes forever",1.0,"Apr 16, 2024","I liked the culture, most people were friendly","I worked there for only a month, and wasn't able to even start doing my job for 2 weeks due to bad training and no access to the data that I required. The team I worked with was on a hybrid schedule, so they worked M-F in office, then Th- Fri were from home. I was only trained a couple of hours a day for the first 3 days I was there, then left to figure it out. This means figuring out a new system, new processes, etc. The Processes and Procedures was horribly written and left out a lot of important material, especially if you got an Error message which happened a lot with the horrible system they use, so on Thursdays and Fridays I tried using them when I was finally given work to do, but made mistakes due to the P/P's missing a whole lot of information. Then if I wanted to ask a question I got dirty looks and slow answers to my questions. When I was let go I still didn't have access to all of the databases that I needed, (it took them 2 weeks just to get me a phone) so I don't feel like they even gave me a chance to prove myself, and the team lead seemed like she didn't want to help or answer any questions. But then when I made a mistake she was all over me for it, and not in a positive way. I appreciate feedback when it is constructive, but they way she did it was demeaning and demoralizing. I was moving work along by the 3rd week and completing the tasks they gave me, and doing my best to figure it out on my own, but that wasn't enough I guess. Some of they other teams seemed to work together, this team didn't want to help or work as a team. If I asked the manager for help, which wasn't often because she was so busy, I would get a patronizing look and answer, like "" you should know this"".

A Company Trying to be New School with Old School Toxicity,2.0,"Sep 8, 2023",There's hybrid flexibility for most roles. I would say the pay is decent. Work-life balance is ok to a point. There is some attempt at employee engagement but I did not see a lot in my time there.,"There was a major focus on production for my role, which was not clearly defined as a production role when I agreed to the position. Loans reviewed per hour are heavily scrutinized by management in order to maximize employee productivity. Failing to hit a certain number per hour meant that an employee would be reprimanded for productivity. The department's ultimate goal is to have a team of 2 to 3 employees do as much as possible within a workday, rather than employing the appropriate number of employees to handle the workload. The end result is employees become micromanaged to ensure that a rigid production schedule is met that isn't necessary and can be obtained by other means. When the workload is very heavy, other departments are often recruited to help disposition files. As one may have guessed, the end result is that many arbitrary errors are found when the files are reviewed. There is no consistency about what the job is meant to be or how day-to-day processes should be conducted between frontline employees, middle management, and top management. Front-line specialists may have. completely different understanding of how certain scenarios should be handled than management. Because of this, new employees may become frustrated or confused because of the different answers that may receive when asking questions. Management lacks actual managerial skills and many are in leadership roles due to being high producers in their past positions. This is a common trope within the mortgage industry, and it would even seem like an appropriate idea if managers were expected to produce just as their subordinates are. However, this is not the case. Managers in this department are strictly salaried supervisors and their expectations are to lead, coach, and give feedback. Since they were promoted for past production and not their potential to motivate and influence employees, they lack the necessary skills to accomplish their intended goal. The end result is that there is a hyper-fixation on production with little to no feedback detailing how to improve or a realistic view that some days production can vary. Essentially middle management views their position as literal micromanagement, leading to a toxic work culture. From personal experience, not only was my hourly production monitored closely, but my emails were monitored by management to ensure screenshots looked appropriate. There are also times when I was reprimanded for not answering an email quickly enough, even when the email had been received within 30 minutes and not marked as urgent. Not only is severe micromanagement an issue, but some managers have no way to conduct themselves in the office. My manager made a habit of frequent inappropriate remarks/stories. These ranged from stories of drug use to a remark made regarding a physical I had requested PTO for.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

They are pretty flexible with you within reason when you have urgent matters come up when life happens. They cater in lunch from time to time and do employee appreciation events. Cafeteria with awesome food options at an affordable cost to employees.,"Very segmented workflows and processes comparatively to other companies which results in terrible pay. This also slows down your production drastically which makes it difficult to hit quotas that are necessary to bonus. The pay is way below industry standards and upper management is the problem, like above the VP, etc. They hire people with decades of experience at very entry level cost. New loan operating system for some of the departments has a lot of kinks, but they are actively working on this. Training and development of new hires needs some work, but they are also actively working on it. The bonus structure is abysmal too, way over complicated and is paid quarterly.

I Was Warned…,3.0,"May 15, 2023",- I had THEE absolute BEST manager on the PLANET (RW) and I honestly couldn’t have handpicked a better group of coworkers. - Decent benefits - Decent pay - Received a promotion while working from home,"*sigh* - As trainers, we were on a rolling 6 week class schedule with literally ZERO time off. When I first began, I went five months without so much as a half day to go to a doctor’s appointment. Every trainer was on this schedule, so there was no opportunity for backup or standby in case the primary trainer had any kind of emergency. I worked sick, with a broke down car in my garage that I couldn’t take to the shop…yeah. - No continuity with the line of business. Our procedures and manuals were embarrassingly outdated and I always felt horrible knowing that the information we were giving participants would be COMPLETELY different once they actually started doing the work. - We were forced to turn in report cards weekly to track individual improvement…not the easiest feat when there are 20 people in your class - and again, you don’t have any type of help. - I went on leave and had to email HR and ask them when I was returning. They took three days to answer me. I returned on the day they gave me, reached out to them and again…three days of nothing. Once they finally acknowledged me, I received a check with two instead of five days of pay because THEY chose to disregard the fact that I was there. - Everything had changed when I returned. We’d returned to the office and gone to a “modular” training style, where we could share one another’s load and not train every single day. Seemed cool, but I wondered why we had to come into the office if we 1) were still training virtually, and 2) not working on a particular day. No joke…out of a 6 week class, I was only scheduled to train 4 days - but was still expected to come in the office every day (in terrible traffic)? Made NO sense. I would go to work, literally sit and do nothing, and go home. I’d ask for extra work/projects to no avail. - What kind of company pushes their employees to go back into the office when gas prices were literally the highest in HISTORY?! A California based company at that, where gas prices are the highest! Completely insensitive and callous call. Also, I was told that going back into the office helped with revenue for the county/city…but I live in the same county/city as the building, so they could have kept that lie for somebody else. - Of the three departments in our division, one was totally remote and the other was Hybrid. It was hard not to take having to come in daily (again, most days for nothing) personally. We kept hearing “PennyMac is a WFO company”, but kept pulling up to a half empty building every day. Whatever the COMPANY is doing, that’s what the COMPANY as a WHOLE needs to do. - Three hours of vacation a paycheck is an absolute joke. You have to work a year just to get a week’s vacation. It’s insane!!!! And I’ve heard “HR is working on it” since I got there in 2019.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Must Avoid,1.0,"May 5, 2023",You can make a lot of money quickly. Many of my coworkers were nice people,"I was originally part of the college development program. If you’re a student this company is a must avoid. They constantly lie to tell you how great of a company they are and how going to any other company to do the job would be a mistake. This was my first red flag here. In my 6 months as a loan officer for Pennymac I had 3 different managers. My first one I was in office still in training and they put me on the only remote team there. Following that they demoted my manager and put me on an in office team, only to demote my manager again. Finally I was put on a more secure team although management at that point was all micromanagement. The work life balance is terrible. Overtime is not optional or is required by the company although they disguise it as optional. The recruiter who hired me told me multiple different lies that I then realized we’re not true when I came to the job. There is tons of micromanagement at the company and upper management always plays favorites. Unless you are a favorite, don’t expect to be treated well by anyone there. The office culture is horrible. The people working there never faced consequences for making jokes about other employees that were often times hurtful and terrible to even witness. I’ve witnessed people out loud make school shooter jokes and racist jokes about other employees and everything is shrugged off. I almost felt uncomfortable speaking to others in the office as I did not want to be at the end of a joke they found humorous that I found offensive. Our site (tampa) constantly finished the lowest of any site for production and this isn’t because of the loan officers there. This is because of the poor management spearheaded by the site lead who proceeded to mismanage the site from the moment I was there. If you’re looking for a place of employment you feel comfortable in, I would avoid Pennymac at all costs unless you find racism and hatred a part of your daily life. I’m glad I no longer work for Pennymac as it was the worst choice I could have ever made graduating university.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Additionally, if you're a new hire and you don't meet their unrealistic goals the ""bonus"" they give you will have to be paid back too. It would be a lot easier to stomach if everyone else in the process wasn't salaried so they don't care if your loans fund.

Which is handy, considering they practically wanted you to live there.","I predict that PennyMac will have severe issues within the next 2 years similar to Countrywide. Upper management has an extremely adversarial stance against all internal governance efforts; to the point that they browbeat you into removing findings from reports. They are compensated for not having findings, so rather than work on fixing anything, they just fight and whine until they are removed off reports. Everyone loses when that happens. On a personal note they expected 60 hrs a week to be normal starting point, so a normal work-life balance was impossible; and I had recently been laid off my prior job so they brought me in at 2 levels lower and a severely cut paycheck because they knew they could take advantage of my situation. It wasn't until I resigned, and they realized just how much I brought to the table, that they attempted to bring me back to a level near what I had previous.

Every time management made a trip out which was about 2 weeks to a month you were called into a one on one review of your performance, production and quality scores. Very hard to get praise.

Pretty good or kinda lame depending on department,3.0,"Mar 10, 2022","If you are not working on the production side of things, you will enjoy good work life balance. I actually really enjoyed the first three years at PennyMac in the office before they closed down two other offices and crammed everyone in. WLB was great, and I didn't mind the lower salary because of that. Once I switched to production, WLB was not always great, and we were often asked to work weekends and work past 5. Mind-numbing multi-hour meetings were also the norm. Final Assessment: If you're early on in your programming career, this is a good place to build some experience and then bounce. If you're later in your career, it's a good place to coast until you retire.","- Will not allow fully remote workers - Less than market rate salary. As a senior, you can expect to make 40k less than the current average - Kind of a boring industry to be in, and it's often difficult to bridge the gap of understanding between the ""business people"" and the programmers unless you already have knowledge of this industry - Working on production = working on the weekends, a million slack channels with people fighting fires, 1+ hour long zoom calls. - Periodic layoffs - Every month you have to do these boring compliance training courses that take at least an hour and have jack squat to do with your job",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

I'll start by saying there is absolutely no job security. People get fired or laid-off all the time on the whim of management. Stan and the other executives will fire anyone and everyone who is not in the C-suite if it will save them a dollar. The company swings from one focus to another depending on what can earn the executives the most money. One day they're focused on servicing, the next on technology, then commercial. Whole groups are turned over or transferred without warning. PennyMac has horrible benefits. They don't care about there employees so why provide benefits? Again, the only thing that matters is how much money can the executives make. Employees are costs to them. The place is basically an arena for unemployable Countrywide Home Loans / BofA alumni to reunite. Bonuses are promised and never paid. The 401K plan doesn't let you in until 1 year of service.

Glad I switched careers,5.0,"Oct 20, 2020","Penny Mac is an amazing company to work for. I have been working for over a year now and enjoy it very much. They always put their employees first. Within days of the pandemic outbreak, they had almost 100% of the company working from home. In addition to keeping our jobs through the crisis, they sent us care packages letting us know they appreciate us. Nothing like opening a package with 4 pints of ice cream in the middle of summer. I can't thank them enough for that. In addition they have this amazing app called vitality that allows you to work towards health goals. When you reach certain metrics, your health insurance is reduced. I love this app and wish I had known about it in my previous career. The managers are great and there is room for advancement which is very nice. I am so thankful to be working here.",There really are no cons.

Pnmac is a compliance company that also happens to originate loans. The LO comes first and it funnels down to mgmt. As a Sales manager of a team of 9 LO's I can tell you we take very good care of our staff. Even in the changing market PNMAC is big enough to have great rates to offer and small enough to be mobile and navigate the market. Pay is excellent as are the benefits",It may shock some folks out there but you actually have to work for your income here.

Not a loan processing position - beware,1.0,"Sep 7, 2022",Some people that work here are nice. That’s it.,"Management is terrible and out of touch. Pay is below average. No opportunities to move up. No raises. Loan Processors are more like glorified customers service, nothing like other mortgage companies that have files assigned to you. In this place they assign you files but expect you to also get involved in other files that you have nothing to do with. There are so many people involved in the file yet the surveys they send only reflect on you (bonus is affected by bad surveys) . So if you did a great job, if someone answered my call and did a bad job my survey is affected. I have never been so confused as to what managements intentions are with this ridiculous process that they can fix by just letting us work like normal loan processors. I have done loan processing before and PennyMac has another idea of what it is. Most of out customers are upset because they are confused on who to speak to. If PennyMacs focus was on customer service, well they failed miserably. If you are looking for a loan processing job, save yourself the grief and dissatisfaction you will feel once you realize its just a customer service job.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

They over-hire and then they mass fire. They just laid off hundred of employees after over-hiring AGAIN. They have done this twice in the last year alone. If you were smart enough to look them up before accepting the job and are reading this review, just know that they will drop you the very second business slows down. In the meeting they just held announcing the mass layoffs, they reassured us that those remaining would not be laid off and they may actually be looking to hire in third quarter (three months from right now). Just goes to show you how they ""value"" employees. They also will not give you a raise. You know who got a raise this year? The CEO.

Technical issues never get better, they are repetitive with no improvement from the start of the company. Lots of downtime due to technical issues. Increased responsibilities with no increase in compensation. New hires with less experience and less responsibilities are making much more than people who've been with the company for years with more experience and responsibilities. In some cases, manager's are making less than their employees. There is so much politics involved in this place, the same people involved in Countrywide's fraud work at the company. The company requires some dept. to work from Monday - Sunday. Absolutely to work/life balance. This company brings the worse out of people and is not worth the stress.

Managers in the tax department sleep around with each other and hire and promote their friends from past employers. Everyone higher up is related to someone either by blood or marriage. The Nepotism is horrendous and the vibe is very high school clique. ""Yes"" people get promoted yet complain about their management. Management makes up their own way of how things should be processed without consulting the actual employees doing the work. The company is a joke and human resources does nothing to investigate the horrible management even when entire departments quit.

Multi-state footprint.,"Processing is lacking, many aspects had to be handled by sales or it wouldn't get done. Slow turn times. Files closing is 60-90 days. Standard pricing not competitive. Special incentive pricing closer to where rest of the market is. Sales managers are do little to provide support when needed most. PennyMac doesn't operate as a sales-based organization, but rather focuses on processors and pays them very well.

Overworked and overtired,2.0,"Jul 14, 2022","It took a few minutes to think of some pros.... and I still haven't really come up with anything. I think the only thing I can really say is that the goal to try to deliver a great consumer experience is admirable. That was what I bought into - a company with a mission to truly help homebuyers. I've been there and the process can be overwhelming, so the mission became really important to me.","There's constant change in management and direction. So that mission that you signed on for? Sometimes you're able to work toward it and sometimes it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, it's about the company being profitable - just like most companies out there. You are literally treated like a child and god forbid if you are paid salary - that means you just have open availability to work whenever they want you to work. You can't do that? Be prepared to hear about it. The expectation is when they call, you run. Life/work balance? What's that? Are you a hard worker? That's great. But don't expect a raise or promotion anytime soon - that takes a few years.

Culture of Incompetence,2.0,"Dec 5, 2020",Company facilities always located close to freeway exits.,"Ineptitude and incompetence at all levels is treated as an open secret and widely tolerated with seldom, if any, consequences for shoddy output. Far too much time is wasted looking for and correcting the errors of lower level employees upon which critical work is based. Management is wildly unimpressive, lacking strong leadership abilities and the basic capability to command a staff effectively to accomplish goals and tasks in a timely manner with positive results. Company has a seat-of-the-pants, Wild West style. “Let’s throw this at the wall and see if it sticks” is not an efficient corporate governance strategy. Pay is mediocre, at best.

He's a top performer too. This company is where careers go to die. They will tell you everything you want to hear to get you in, but then you're trapped. I never realized how much I hated this place until I wasn't there anymore. Ran by all the old Countrywide execs.

Extremely micromanaged. Your entire day is monitored from the moment you sign in until you sign out, including all your bathroom breaks. If you get stuck on a long call and go late to your breaks or lunch, it counts against your metrics for the month. Everything is recorded and managers will plug into a call from the desk to listen in. As well as the control tower( who monitors how the call queue.) if your calls are longer then 6 minutes it will count against your monthly metrics. New employees get 3 sick days, so use them wisely. You will get written up if you go over them. Vacation time must be accrued before any request can be made.

A true work family environment,5.0,"Aug 22, 2017","First of all the pay is amazing. Also, when it comes to your work experience they give you a real chance to learn about the mortgage industry.

There is also opportunity for overtime all of the time. Which is nice if you are ever in need of extra money and you want to do that math you know what you need to do how many hours into work, in order to get the money that you need. I would say the best part about working here is that you really feel like you are working with friends and family. You get a supervisor who has a team, and you have meetings at least once or twice a month. Outside of that there is the opportunity to get sale bonuses each month, but it is not required in a sense of you have to push sales it is nearly an opportunity while having a conversation with a customer. Oh and not to mention, they have their own cafeteria that you get a free meal tickets for whenever you work 30 minute lunches.","If you are used to having your weekends to yourself, then working at PennyMac may not be a good idea for you.

With mortgage rates at 6%+, PesoMac is a sinking ship. Upper management has overseen the loss of hundreds of jobs multiple times this year, even veterans to the company. HR literally teaches managers that raises don't improve performance or morale.

If you can't hit a deadline because of quality concerns -- the senior leaders listen and don't push the teams into delivering poor quality. Halloween is super fun at PennyMac!,Where to begin. Very stingy company. Was told during the interview process I would never get a raise -- ever. There is no real review system in place -- so they don't really rank your performance. The vacation plan is two weeks only and you have to accrue. Been a professional in my space for 25 years -- treated the same as a first time employee in terms of vacation. If i want a few days more than 10 -- i have to take it without pay. No comp time for all the overtime. In Moorpark there is nowhere to park. If you go out to lunch you won't find parking when you return. I get to work 30 minutes early just to park. The worst is no sense of work life balance. Basically this is a call center company -- so they base all decisions on how it impacts call center performance. Even if you're in IT or accounting. No working from home ever. They demand you work from 8:30 - 5:30 -- which puts you squarely in terrible traffic. Must wear business casual -- jeans are ok on Friday.

,3.0,"Feb 29, 2016",Penny Pantry is very convenient for lunch (if you work at the Moorpark office) For the most part the people are nice,"Pennymac is the type of company that wants to squeeze the most possible out of employees while giving as little as possible in return. - vacation policy - 2 weeks (3 weeks after five years). pretty pathetic compared to what some companies are offering - holidays - only 8 per year. So if you are accustomed to getting the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas eve off, you'll be spending two of your meager 10 vacation days for that. - health insurance is expensive and not very good - even stingy about bathrooms. Never have I been at a company where on a daily basis I had to go to another bathroom because the one I went to was full - seems gung ho about open seating (I think this is so they can watch you continuously). there seems to be a mistrust of employees, assuming people will not do their jobs if they aren't out in the open. (also reflected in the policy that nobody can work from home because they won't know if you are working). I guess they don't realize they can look at your work output / quality to see if you are doing a good job? - no raises for cost of living. If you are just doing your job and not striving for promotion (some people don't want more money for more responsibility, they are happy at their level), you won't get a raise. Which means as the years go by, you are effectively paid a little less each year. Of course they say that they are working to improve the culture. I seriously don't expect much to change.

What You Need to Know as a Loan Officer,5.0,"Aug 3, 2022","PennyMac is a land of opportunity if you are willing to work. I am forever thankful for the opportunities that were given to me. In the 2.5 years I was here, I found myself holding different roles and taking on different responsibilities I never thought I'd take on. I have gained skills and knowledge that go far beyond mortgage origination that will serve me well in my career. My relationships with my colleagues have evolved into life long friends. I had cool bosses, who I learned more from than my college professors. Now as far as mortgage origination goes, the biggest perks to me are: Paid training, all licenses paid for, inbound leads that know nothing but PennyMac, pricing exceptions to keep your product competitive, rate lock extension costs are 99% of the time eaten by the company and cool people to work with.","Ideas to help management retain more employees: Communication is not as effective as it could be. Key announcements are distributed via email or Google chat. Simply put, they get lost. Steep learning curve to digest all systems needed to originate. Town halls with the managing director would help build the culture as well as company happy hours. Paper plates, company paid for healthy snacks and some signage on the wall would spruce up the place. Certainly fixing the broken glass window and patching the dry wall. It is cool that we have foosball and corn hole though. Give and take I suppose.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Don't even get me started on the location too, I live in my car traveling to and from this frontier outpost... Those unfortunate to be hired in the 2008-2011 era can be extremely under-pad, I mean they make maybe 50% of what they should or would make other places. There is this insane attitude that raisers can only be 10% unless you have serious backing from the chosen ones. I've never had a raise in my 2+ years and keep being told ""it's coming"". Stan apparently approves EVERY SINGLE RAISE for any level, micro-manage much? Oh, and bonuses? Well they get paid out in halfs, once in March, once in October thanks guys, makes it feel so special (my bonus was literally less than paycheck each time). We've lost some great folks so far as people realize they have opportunities elsewhere and that is only the beginning.

There aren't much opportunities for the Flex Ops after College in the Fort Worth office (can't speak for other locations). With the various majors each person has, there's not a way [for us] to transition here and continue to grow with the company.

Simply the BEST,5.0,"May 26, 2021","I began working with PennyMac as a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator in December or 2020; prior to my transition, I had minor reservations due to it essentially being one of the most unique, extraordinary, and pressurized times to make such a career transition… let alone into this high volume industry. However, my reservations were cleared soon enough- PennyMac was incredibly easy to work with during my transition, and provided all of the support and training that was needed and beyond. Transitioning to PennyMac allowed me to obtain 27 state licenses within just one short month of being on-boarded to the company, which easily exceeded my expectations! The company culture, including the kindness and diversity of individuals here, the willingness of the leadership team to jump in to assist, the every-day never ending fresh and viable leads, the excellent online reviews that I may refer my borrowers to, the A+ with the Better Business Bureau, being a publically traded company, the millions of borrowers that are already inherently trusting the company with their mortgages, Benefits, 401K’s, compensation, employees being shown that they are valued and treated as the greatest asset every day, loans NEVER being sold to competitors, costs being competitive, and Pricing Exceptions turning around SO QUICKLY, are just a FEW of the praises I could go on about regarding benefits with PennyMac!! I feel incredibly lucky and valued with this company every day, and it clearly shows to each borrower that I meet. The company is rightfully stringent on compliance and takes the laws incredibly seriously- the objective, moral, logical thing for a federally regulated type of organization. However, in addition: Loan Officers such as myself are rewarded for literally doing our job and maintaining the laws that govern our role, i.e., keeping up with compliance in our conversations borrowers, and our monthly/annual continuing education. The compensation has the ability to be extraordinary; for an extraordinary individual, the sky is the limit. Ultimately, it is both the individuals who are selected to drive the leadership team, and the employees who assist in driving the company to success, that are the highlight of the day to day. Each day is one to feel valued, feeling as though the company is fully supported towards running such as a well-oiled machine. Well done PennyMac…it is beyond easy to recognize why this company is widely regarded as one of the OVERALL BEST mortgage companies around.","Would like a procedure booklet for miscellaneous hard-stops for one particular system, but these typically get sorted out quickly anyhow.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Best call center mortgage lender,4.0,"May 5, 2022","Company is very focused on transparency, following regulations, and doing the right thing. Sometimes (perhaps even often) to a fault. But I'd much rather work for a company too focused on being honest than work for one that doesn't care about it at all. Pay is great and the company is very proactive about shifting pay tiers to current market conditions. Coworkers are great. Most everyone enjoys coming into work and enjoys their job, even in this rising rate environmeout, UNBEATABLE pricing and when we do rarely get beat out, it's very easy to verbally negotiate to win the business. Lots of autonomy and respect for how you run your business. As long as you stay on top of everything and have solid production. You pull credit, price out the file, run AUS, and lock the loan without any required interference from anyone else. Overtime has been cut back on, but it isn't much of an issue. You're required to work one scheduled Saturday a month, and can put in occasional overtime outside of that as long as it's for follow up work. I didn't start my time in the mortgage industry here, but I wouldn't work for any other call center mortgage lender other than PennyMac. I was fortunate enough to not be one of the many who were inevitably laid off these past few months. But that wasn't PM specific. The whole industry is in shambles right now.","No sales training. If you're new to sales you'll either need to learn that stuff through: trial and error, advice from coworkers and managers, sales videos, and books. You are only taught the technical aspects of the mortgage origination software here. No training on how to pitch a loan either. This is a good place to end up at after being with one or two other companies. As I said, overly concerned with compliance to a fault. Lots of unnecessary and trivial tasks to submit a loan. It feels like there's a large disconnect from compliance and the sales department. There's a very very lengthy ""wrap-up script"" you have to read to lock any loan. They are somewhat aware of this annoyance and so they give you a $500 bonus every month as long as you don't get any compliance fails. It often feels like the company would love us to be robots, only capable of reciting the very limited scripts they give us. But obviously thats not enforced because otherwise no one would want to do business with us.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

"Great Job, Poor Leadership",3.0,"Mar 28, 2021","The job is not exactly as advertised, but could certainly be a great one to have if led by better management. Coworkers were awesome and easy to socialize with. Job was challenging enough to keep engagement, while remaining an easy task.","The reason why I would not recommend this job is because there is no ambition to strive for greater. Leadership does not appreciate any collaboration to boost job performance. From my experience, my manager preferred to control and dictate the way in which a person must do their daily job functions. Manager was allowed to force the team to take lunch at a specific time with set times to take a break with no regards to the preferences of the the customers in regards to contacting them in relation to their loans. Also, the hours constantly changed. Management provided that hours would change from training to the official start, but they did not explain that hours would also change after you started the job. If this is the job that you would like to work, be prepared to be treated as a robot that is expected to do exactly as told. Free thinking is not allowed, even if it optimizes your job performance. Be sure to keep tabs on all of your job processes, but do not make it known. Screenshots are a necessity to have, but not need rather than to need and not have. I would also recommend that you get management to provide you either written or recorded affirmations of what you have been told. This is not to say that management is to not be trusted, but it is to say that you want to be well prepared just in case the job starts to become stressful and records start to age into a forgotten zone.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

From Great Team & SM to Finding out the True Company Colors,3.0,"Jul 6, 2022",The *people* in the office truly got along in most cases and supported one another. My sales manager and team specifically were amazing! Great dynamic we personally had; nearby teams essentially followed! Most of the tenure was great with these individuals! Picked mostly wonderful staff. ********************************** The Con is a review of the Finale of most of their employees. I will still provide 3 stars for an average rating. I could’ve been tricked into giving 5 for how great my team was but it would not be fair. The following Con was true in my experience and shows the company colors (tiger stripes) when looked beyond the team pond and out.,"When the industry changed due to this year’s tip in inflation, they demoted every female SM in my branch to LO. Many of the males retained their positions and fewer were demoted. Loyal employees were mislead though to the end with the Ultimate Layoff; almost every single LO terminated. (No prior official warning) In general, a member of senior management verbally assured employees that they were built for such changes via the company structure; throughout the beginning of the year to the very end. They said essentially “we always pivot and succeed.” Pivoted their staff off the roster, and the opposite of being direct, I see. Some leadership even commented on other companies doing such layoffs with distaste. Can you spell h y p o c r i c y? Assuming they surely knew their own plans all along they’d have been best to have prepared their employees to step aside and find new opportunities before other companies in the same industry did just the same. Disrespectful to employees efforts. I had a feeling it was coming months ahead but asking a couple peers privately if they thought it would happen, they said, “no way!” Because of assurances. Then they all became unprepared, unlike me, I left very shortly before The Event. I felt tension, I felt fake, and like I was being lied to not by my SM but by those above about that certain reality, and felt expected to smile, and not ask questions as those leadership pawns talked of assurance and how they’d PIVOT and get better. Thanks PNMAC, loved your staff! Glad to see you valued them immensely and let them down easy! (not..) Last con: this probably won’t matter because of capitalism; they seem to have demonstrated at the end they cared less for those who had supported the company for months or years and their livelihood/quality of life than their bottom dollar. Least they could do it was say it than leave everyone else unprepared in the market. Things likely won’t change next time. But they hurt a lot of people I knew in an already historically bad year with cold regard. Surely this is not all the Phoenix branch and could be corporate orders, but that is to say it should not have been the case.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

It was a nice gesture. Sadly, the rest of the culture is just awful. It’s just another lender ran by “the good old boys” from the now defunct lenders who created the turmoil of the last lending crisis. The pay was decent but could be better. Benefits were fairly priced. Met many great managers and fellow LO’s and Ops members. Tremendous talent there until the mass layoffs. The good talented people got cut, leaving just the good old boys and their BFF’s like it’s high school all over again. Top performers with stellar quarterly and annual reviews IN writing/documented. ALL gone! If you don’t know mortgage they do have decent training program. I came on as a Senior LO so I didn’t need the training but got to see it firsthand and it’s good. Office is very nice. Modern. HQ has a restaurant inside! Very cool facilities. Coffee is good. That is important too for any hard working LO. Get rid of the toxic old school individuals here and you’ve got a company that will last! Many things could be solved by asking the hard working employees who work there. I’d go back in a heartbeat if the flaws were addressed head first. I truly believe in this company.","Low Comp, Leads aren’t consistent. You can’t go from making $200K to $60K due to lead inconsistency. Don’t blame the market because I’m referencing the time before rates went up. Lack of true culture that’s inclusive and welcoming to everyone including women and minorities. It’s 2023 soon! Not 1990! The diversity and inclusion program is a joke currently. Upper Management is aged out, stuck in their old toxic ways. Too buddy buddy/ high school popularity contest nonsense. Trim the true fat. Them! Stop laying off all the talented folks who have given years of hard work here. Give both the LO and Processors more control over their files. Then you’ll stop the crazy fallout! Listen to your employees from the bottom up. Less micromanagement of preforming employees. It’s counterproductive to many. The company gave up too quick, too easily just to keep stockholders happy. Mass layoffs could’ve been avoided and done more strategically. Stop lying to the media and fess up on layoffs. Soon you will need quality employees again and a lot of those same people who were displaced by the mass layoff will still be looking for a job while you do not have enough individuals to run the business. It’s just a vicious circle and very avoidable.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place,1.0,"Jun 23, 2015","The company is growing out of control, the amount of work that it's creating for itself means that there will always be insufficient staffing, and therefore you will always be tasked with learning a new skill because no one else will be put into the position that actually handles those tasks.","Where do I start? This company's projections are irrational. They are biting off more than they can chew, stressing out employees and every single department. They are lacking in infrastructure, aside for being understaffed and having the feel of a sweatshop. You get 10 vacation days per year, which you have to accumulate. Also the case with sick time, you accumulate 4 hours per month. Things here are grim on every perspective. starting with lack of parking spots, (translating into having to walk from a different company's parking lot on a different street for 10 minutes until you get to your building), continued with the crowded work environment (which is often so loud you can't actually focus on work) to the poor computing technology that hardly supports the tasks needed to be done on a regular basis. The absolute worst of this company is that management is severely lacking in leadership skills. often managers will not acknowledge their employees or even realize how knowledgeable and experienced they are. Career pathing is formally not on the agenda. nepotism rages out of control. You will most likely not get a raise, ever. I have seen people get promoted 2 or 3 times, without getting a raise, with the title change being delayed up to 3 months, and taking on additional responsibilities while minimizing their personal life outside of work for the sake of being able to function. HR is a joke, they take forever to handle claims, and in some cases they even drop the ball to a point where medical workers comp claims get denied because they don't provide forms in due time. Executives pretty much will not acknowledge your existence even if you interact with them on a daily basis. Unless a manager need something from you, he will not even say hello. Promotions are often based on veterancy and position availability. most of the time because of the high turnover rate - positions will just become available and it will be cheaper for the company to promote somebody from within without giving them a raise, rather than hiring somebody from the outside and to try and match market salaries.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

The cafeteria also served decent food at times. The gym is decent given the size of the room.","I would describe the company culture as being TOXIC at best due to WEAK MANAGEMENT. I had the misfortune of working with managers who were very unapproachable (even narcissistic) and only talked to you when they needed something ASAP (not even a “Good Morning”). In addition, there were many managers who were INCOMPETENT and LACKED FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS to do the job as managed with an “IRON FIST”. Many times, they will take credit for your ideas and work to cover up their own shortcomings. I also felt there was a LACK OF TRANSPARENCY working on projects since I was NOT INVITED TO CRITICAL MEETINGS and UNREALISTIC DEADLINES WERE PROMISED to the stakeholder. To make matters worse, I wasted more time having to re-clarify what deliverables are needed as well as being under intense pressure to get things done. In addition to WEAK MANAGEMENT, I would also describe the atmosphere as being a “SECRET SOCIETY” where privileged people (those that have tight connections as a result of nepotism) are allowed to prosper and surpass me (in terms of growth and future opportunities) after I’ve shared all of my valuable knowledge (which took years to develop) with them. Largely, I felt that whatever significant contributions that I have made to the department go unnoticed by upper management unless one of their “privileged” kids had done it (or stolen credit for it). If you decide to join PennyMac, just know that: 1. The commute is horrible and parking is problematic (no work from options allowed). 2. You will be low-balled on salary. 3. Their health benefits are expensive. 4. It will take a very, very long time to accrue any vacation time. 5. You must wait 1 year after start date before you can enroll in 401k program. 6. No work/life balance. 7. No raises or merit increases or promotions unless the CEO approved it (which can take an eternity – this is where it helps to have “tight connections”). 8. Be prepared to be exploited and/or marginalized. 9. Have headphones on to drown out obnoxious, fake laughs. Do not have headphones on when the CEO is in the vicinity (as this is one of his pet peeves). Although I am grateful for the skills that I’ve learned and for the relationships that I’ve developed there, but if I had a do-over, I would have only USED the PennyMac OFFER letter as LEVERAGE (without any intent of ever joining).",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

The worst company I have ever worked for,1.0,"May 13, 2019",The meal plan is excellent. For $125 you have unlimited lunch and breakfast.

Normal business hours are 9 to 7, but you will often have meetings as early as 8 am; that doesn't mean you get to leave earlier. During certain times of the year you will be expected to come in on Saturday and/or Sunday. - They purposely don't provide laptops, so you have to be in the office to do your work. It's considered a great honor if you're lucky enough to ask for and receive a laptop, but even then, you're expected to work from the office. - 2 weeks of vacation until you've been at the company for 5 years. 3 weeks after that. - Day after Thanksgiving and day after Christmas are not off. - During the fires last year, even if your office was closed, you were expected to show up at another office. People were scrambling to find seats. They just didn't want to give you a 'day off.' - Coworkers are generally pretty unimpressive and one-dimensional. - Mediocre health insurance benefits. - You get half of your bonus every 6 months, so if you need to leave between April and October, you're forfeiting half of your bonus. This is done deliberately to make you stay at the company, or maybe it's another indication of PennyMac nickel and diming literally everything. - No company holiday party, but a couple times a year they bring food trucks and you get to wait in long lines to get a bite to eat and a lukewarm beer. - Extremely steep organization with layers upon layers of middle management. A VP title means squat. They also don't promote quickly, both in title and pay. - They lowball on salary but bonus targets are high.

You're a passionate Engineer? Don't work here. Period.,1.0,"Nov 2, 2014",Great cafeteria options (although a little expensive) Great gym and facilities,"If you're a passionate software or infrastructure engineer, just stay away from this place. Not only is there unnecessary process and office politics at every turn, but you have to deal with bully managers and a systemic toxic culture that leaves no room for work/life balance. And as others have mentioned, you will never get a raise at this place, ever. No bonus for you either, while most managers and executives roll into work in their $60k+ cars and have performance incentives in the form of QUARTERLY bonuses. Engineering is seen as nothing more than overhead and a bottom pyramid servicing department (like is the case with most financial services companies). This means they need you to follow orders, and not ask too many questions. Don't expect to have any freedom at all while writing code, or architecting systems either. They might lead you on to thinking you have control, but you have no authority over projects, yet are expected to be responsible for the outcome. Responsibility and authority are inseparable. This dynamic does inevitably lead to failures, that will hang over your head. Still feel like you wanna give this company a try and see for yourself? Well, you'll be looking at legacy code and poorly documented systems all day and working on a ton of dead end projects. Hard work will earn you no credibility whatsoever. You'll spend hours stuck in meetings and managers will then wonder why you're still debugging. You will then be asked to work weekends because ""things just need to get done around here"". If this is what you want day in and day out, then go for it.

God forbid we have transparency... I'll echo what many have said below: 1) Poor systems - yes, your loan application will take anywhere from 1-4+ hours, and don't complain about the systems, all roads lead to: It's your fault 2) Hours - plan on gaining weight, eating microwave food, never seeing the light of day, and putting family time on hold 3) Plan on having any/all ""concerns"" dismissed by the sociopaths in charge. They've sold their souls, and they expect you to do the same. 4) Without going into detail, if you're a highly ethical/empathetic/caring individual, it's not the place for you to work. You'll continually get to deliver bad news to clients for reasons I cannot discuss here. 5) They put the ""Cult"" in ""Culture"" - So anyone that's caught speaking up, will be tracked down and pulled into meetings; So if you want a taste of what employment might be like in China, or other authoritarian dictatorships, PNMAC is a great place to learn what that's like. 6) Fundings - Anytime you think you're going to have that ""great month"" watch as fulfillment/processing and others that you count on simply disappear at key points in the process, leaving your clients calling you asking why the notary didn't show up. 7) Expect contradictory guidance - at one moment you're told to do X, then plan on being pulled into a meeting for doing too much of X. 8) Watch as people are promoted SOLELY for parroting management. It truly is like High School 9) Plan on having your loans purposefully and strategically delayed so that by the time you DO decide you want out, you'll be forced to walk away from many clients you worked hard at covering up all of the shortcomings of the company and keeping them on board with the process, because you wont' get paid and in fact, PNMAC hires ""special"" bean counters to go through your pipeline to try to reduce any/all income before you leave. They love what they do and will send you condescending emails with voice of resentment, as if it's your fault that the company has made poor choices and you're now leaving. 10) Finale' time!!! Good luck finding employement anywhere else in a direct to consumer MLO role. When recruiters see PennyMac on your resume, you'll be passed up, OR if you do actually go through the long list of reasons why you left, they simply will not believe you and label you as ""jaded."" Recruiters have zero clue as to how tragically poor the operation here is, that they will actually believe you're just making it up. My advice to recruiters: Believe the reviews here.

Wolves in Sheeps Clothing,1.0,"May 25, 2022",Pay was decent and overtime was offered when 'they' needed us and WE pulled through for 'them'. I did take away more knowledge in a particular area of mortgage from this job.,"I was laid off 5/9/22. The 'WE' I speak of are the numerous 'bodies/numbers' that handled the load when the market was exploding when covid hit and all the bodies before me that gave their best to PennyMac over the years, namely many veterans, including myself, who were there in the trenches when it counted. Upper management has no idea of key employee contributions and stellar records because they don't care to know. I was under a management team that came to the company connected to each other and used our knowledge and ideas making them their own promising help and support to advance in the company when, in the end, they cut us loose once they had what they needed. No efforts by management to communicate with other managers in the company to move key, talented employees into other areas of interest. They say they will do this but never follow through with the support of their statements that they will do all they can to help you succeed. I felt used in the end and taken advantage of, BUT knew in my heart all along the kind of 'clickish' people I was under anyway. I still showed up to my job each day and proved my worth so felt good having helped 'MY clients' in my role with PennyMac on a personal level. I felt sad when I was laid off, BUT also felt a weight of lies and deceipt lifted off my life of which I am the wiser for. You always hear of large companies in this manner. ""It's corporate America, they (the big fishes) are all about revenue never thinking of the LOYAL LITTLE FISHES that are helping them swimming in the trenches, taking care of the customers each day going above and beyond."" From the biggest fishes (upper management) down to lower management, unless you fit their idea of staying a subservient employee ALWAYS, never having a desire to advance your career, you will lose in the end with PennyMac. Save yourself the trouble and STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY! OR, take advantage of learning 1 thing really well expecting once you do, you will be ready to move on to another company cause' this one does not have an interest in paying you your worth in the end. I believe one of the reasons PennyMac is set up the way it is, namely people working only 1 specific area of the loan process is to keep them hungry for more knowledge and leaving them trapped with expertise only in only one skill set as many they hire don't have broad experience in the mortgage industry. They can't have people learning and knowing too much because it's NOT this companies practice to advance people in their careers and PAY THEM MORE MONEY. This is truly a revolving door company where advancement is not based on merit. I saw MANY talented AND CLASSY people leave the company on their own, wise to this practice, before lay offs and even after the first round of layoffs. I happened to be laid off in the second round having top production numbers for 2 and 1/2 years while having the best record of helping loans to close on time, etc.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Great place to work if you’re looking for a “Good ‘Ol Boys Club”!!,1.0,"Sep 30, 2022",Sadly the only two things I can think of are decent benefits and a subsidized cafeteria.,"They do not treat women as equals, and even border on sexual harassment, which seems to be a part of their culture. Right before the pandemic, any managers with employees working under them were pulled into a meeting, not shockingly, most of them were men. When they returned, they gathered around near my desk and joked and laughed at a mandate to hire more women. My manager turned to me, and said, “yeah, I was pretty much told I HAD to hire you because you were female.” Another incident with an MD, reviewing presentation materials with my group. It was stressed that everything needed to be perfect, to which the male MD turned and looked at me (the only female in the room), and said, “well that’s why she’s here. To make things pretty.” I also witnessed my male colleague, hired at the same time as me, get one on one training on a daily basis. I was never afforded the same, and in fact, when I asked questions I was treated like I was stupid and told to figure it out myself. Not only was he given more training, but also more work to do. There would be hours upon hours that I was given little to no work to do, but he would be kept busy…it was so obvious that the manager in charge of our work actually said to me, “I know I’m giving him all the work right now, but he needs to learn how to use Excel.” So…because he was under qualified he gets all the work? Or is it because Im female and they were trying to squeeze me out? It’s truly a wonder they haven’t seen sued. Steer clear unless you have thick skin and are prepared to put up with this 1950’s mentality.

Disappointing.,1.0,"Dec 28, 2013",Parking is free and there is an on-site cafeteria.,"Unfriendly and unprofessional environment. The middle manager over our department delegated a lot of responsibility to seniors or ""team-leads"". The people in these positions were not only very young and inexperienced but also downright immature and catty. They clearly held their personal friends to more lenient standards than the rest of us and took good care of their friends when doling out various work assignments. There were times when people at adjacent desks would be supposedly working on important projects and I would hear nothing but whispering and giggling (not exaggerating here) or in some cases loud talking and flirting for 10, 15, and 20 minutes at a time as I was working my hardest during a very busy day. I eventually invested in some earbuds. Also, I witnessed cases of well-connected people getting picked for promotions over those who were clearly superior candidates in terms of tenure and performance. I noticed that (shocker) young entry-level people whose parents or family members worked at the company or BoA/CW managed to move out of the trenches and into much better positions with the most incredible speed. The Moorpark location is a long drive from most parts of L.A. It is actually in a business park on the outskirts of town which is even worse because you have to drive 5-10 minutes into town if you want to eat somewhere other than the company cafeteria. It was announced to us that everyone in the company would lose one of their discretionary days but the exact explanation given was that both discretionary days were to be replaced with a single ""religious freedom"" day. Interesting. Around the same time, the company became much more aggressive about hiring many more new workers as temps and also keeping them at temp status for as long as possible. Many temps (I was not a temp) of over 6 months tenure who had proven themselves to be solid employees were still being denied conversion to full employee status (and therefore all benefits). Given what I know and what I've heard about the history of Countrywide and Kurland's involvement in it, I probably should have come in with lower expectations.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Crazy Metrics High turn over,1.0,"May 11, 2021",Cool colleagues. Clean bathrooms. Good training.,"One of the highest turnovers in the industry. I think their goal is to have a high turnover so you work yourself to death trying to meet their metrics only to get fired or resign and walk away from your pipeline so they don't have to pay you. Terrible upper management who puts pressure on lower management and in turn all others suffer. Unattainable metrics (everyone has had a write-up at some point at this company). As your call #'s go up, your call-to-app will go down because it's impossible to do an application on people who were transferred to you who have no intention of refinancing. As your call-to-app goes down, you will receive a write-up. If you increase the number of applications you take to increase those numbers (doing applications on people who you know the loan won't close), your call to app will go up but your app to funding will go down. Micromanaged to death. No work-life balance. I have a friend who still works there. He is in the top 15 Loan Officers by funding and currently has a write-up. He has to hear his manager complain on a daily basis about his call volume. Nothing anyone does is good enough at this company. They care more about metrics than the bottom line. This goes to show, even if your end goal is to close many loans, you still aren't good enough. Their goal is to get you to meet their metrics, not close loans. While I was there (one of the only females), I had a perverted manager who always stood really close and when I was sitting down he'd lunge his crotch in my face when my head was at his waist level.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

"Should have taken these other reviews as warning. Single parents, listen up.",1.0,"Jun 1, 2023","The wonderful history within the Ryman and the Grand Ole Opry. Saying that you work for either of them always garners impressive comments from others. But that don't pay the bills. Pay is okay, but not for the amount of unneeded stress you'll endure.","HR department is terrified of communicating with anyone who's not ""top-floor"". Highly tout ""hybrid, flexible workplace"" when interviewing, but please don't be fooled. You'll get one day WFH/week at best, and they make you feel bad about it. The corporate office is more cliquey and catty than a teen movie. The amount of bickering that goes on between leadership roles over the dumbest projects and deadlines is laughable. If they'd spend half of the energy expended on that (or the inane team-building exercises you're forced to endure) lord knows what kind of heights this company would be taken to... And it's not like the company is doing terribly - they're rich as balls and like to tell you about it, as if it's also in your bank account as well. ""Hey everybody, come see how good I look!"" As I said, single parents - listen up. I'm a single father of 2 very young children, and from the day that I was hired, I was up-front in communicating that I needed to make full use of their so-called flex-time and remote policies, as there are times where I have no control over what time I need to leave the office in order to pick up my kids on-time. I was CONSTANTLY bullied by my direct supervisor over this, requesting that I submit my arrival/departure schedule to her WEEKLY for approval, though it never changed. Well, that wasn't going to happen. I was terminated because of this, and it's wrong on so many levels. Mental health is not a concern for leadership or HR. If you disclose you have a problem and need help, they will single you out. Also, get ready for all of the most cliché meme-worthy moments possible in a corporate setting. Pizza parties to celebrate record earnings in Q1! Teambuilding exercises at an escape room. All the gaslighting you can take. Take heed and go elsewhere. This place doesn't have the legacy of any of these historic brands they manage in mind, just how much they can earn. I get it, we're all in business for money, but take care of your people. Lastly - Diversity & Inclusion is touted as a top priority in this organization, but it's laughable.

The Peter Principle At Work,2.0,"Feb 7, 2019","The company has some great benefits for full-time team members (health, dental, + vision with a very reasonable employee contribution, a 401k with a 4% match vested immediately) and they rely very heavily on their long-standing reputation as meccas within the entertainment industry. They talk all the time about how cool it is to work there because of the Ryman Auditorium and the Grand Ole Opry, and depending on your role, you will get to interface with some great music business connections, as well as go to some fun destinations along with the hotel properties they own and new Ole Red restaurant chain. If you work in the corporate building, you have access to some perks such as $4 lunch in the cafeteria on Tuesdays and Thursdays, a gym, Crossfit and Yoga classes, and if you are at a certain level within the company, you can request tickets in the suite at Bridgestone Arena for concerts, events, and Predators games.","The company has an internal identity that is completely at odds with the actual working experience. HR and C-Suite level team members talk all the time about the great culture and how cool it is to work there, but the culture is very condescending, mainly held as a standard for front line and hourly employees while salaried and senior leaders are not held equally accountable and are not well versed in the culture themselves. The culture on paper looks good at first glance, but upon a little closer observation, you realize it's just leftovers from the days when the company operated the hotel, and most leaders couldn't tell you the Vision Statement if their life depended on it, let alone the other components of the aspirational, cartoony fluff being passed off as core to the company's values. Speaking of Salaried and Hourly Employees... the pay is good if you are an exempt team member, but if you are hourly you have to fight for every cent you have. There is no consistent policy for team outings (birthday lunches- am I expected to participate as a volunteer or stay on the clock?), and in general the pay is less than what you can make elsewhere in Nashville. There are lots of leaders that are holdovers from the Gaylord days, and many of them have risen to a level in the organization that is completely beyond their capabilities and skillsets. As a result, many of these mid- to high level leaders work constantly (several of my leaders have sent me emails at 3am and no, they aren't working the entertainment shows on these nights) in order to try to outpace their inadequacy and inability to delegate properly. There is a culture that you have to give everything to work, which would be one thing if people worked well together. On the contrary, the organization is extremely disconnected, with each team operating as its own silo, and communication is abysmal, with lots of duplicate work because the culture does not encourage sharing of resources and knowledge. There is no regular feedback process for team members to go through to voice concerns and frustrations other than going directly to HR, who rarely make an effort to correct the situation. The only real time an employee can voluntarily voice feedback is when leaving the company, and then the HR team discounts the perspectives as disgruntled employees. When feedback is done, it is in the form of handpicking team members to talk to the CEO so that he gets a very sanitized view of the perception within the organization. Voluntary development tools are also lacking; leaders are expected to attend mandatory training periodically, but there is no accountability if a leader decides not to participate. They only offer tuition reimbursement on college degree programs, so if you want to get a certificate or other training that would positively impact your abilities in your role, it is dependent on if your leader is willing to part with a few dollars from their budget (precious few leaders see the value in this). Most disturbing is the fact that all the C-suite leaders have surrounded themselves with yes men. Anytime an executive changes direction or priority, the whole team is expected to jump up and immediately get to work on the passion project du jour. The leaders can get ugly and aggressive in meetings and lash out at team members, but there is no culture of open dialogue and feedback, so rather than having a heated but open conversation on the goals and direction of strategy, mid-level leaders kowtow to this behavior, come back to their teams, and have truly unreasonable expectations for the team members to then meet these new deadlines and project achievements. There is no solid priority set for the future, so the minute a C-suite leader makes an offhanded comment about one area, everyone jumps to make a difference in that business area (think of rats skittering from side to side on a ship). This means that when new leadership is brought in, the selection process is very short sited or expectations are grandiose (we've had 3 new CMOs in 2 years, and multiple people are starting to count on 2 hands the number of bosses they've reported to in the same time period). Some leaders overstep their bounds to assert their dominance on areas of the business they shouldn't be involved in; meanwhile, other leaders don't hold their team accountable.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

It happened multiple times during my years with the company. Often times, the restructures were not well thought out and caused more issues than anything, which eventually lead to more restructuring. Depending on the position, there isn't a great work-life balance. Corporate is very political. The Opry will always be the ""golden child"". As a whole, the company will talk about all the growth potential, but realistically, the opportunities for promotions are few and far between.

In fact, at this point I feel major guilt when we interview/hire amazing candidates because I know their talents are going to be wasted coming in here. RHP claims to want to be hiring ""experts in their fields"" but really they only want yes-men that will jump when C-Suite (or the select few individuals that hold tremendous amounts of power) says “jump”. Between constantly sticking up for your work (your manager/director will not) through a spider web of red-tape and approvals, and the horrendous work-life balance you will quickly burn-out. But that's okay! There are members of C-Suite that have been on record saying they want younger employees that they can pay less and work harder. Unfortunately, that's probably why we are sitting at a 50%+ turnover rate. Many members of my team (and I know to be true of other departments in the organization) have attempted to go to their leaders and tell them that things are not working, and we need to come together and find ways to fix things or we are going to see a lot of people leave. These conversations are all met the same way with harsh defenses and ""your feelings are incorrect"". Feedback given to the HR team is swept under the rug.

Occasionally, we have a farmers market that showcases local produce and vendors.","This company suffers from poor leadership from the top down. The CEO surrounds himself with ""yes men"" who reinforce his outlook and priorities. At one point, one of our weaker business ventures had been poorly performing for months and the CEO became aware of this last, mostly due to no one telling him about the failure. Other C-suites remain out of touch regarding day to day tasks and responsibilities of their team but remain mercurial. When they do decide to jump in and work with the team, they cause more confusion in their effort to catch up on the business. When it becomes apparent that the leadership is out of the loop, has not read emails, etc, they become defensive or act out. Poor leadership at this company has created a company culture where employees (who are trained adults and experts in their fields) have zero autonomy or authority in their work --- everything is second guessed after the fact and minute details that don't jive with the absent c-suites are deemed as ""big misses"" and projects grind to a screeching halt over elements that are not business impacting or revenue driving. This company does not reinvest in their employees encouraging additional training, certificates, conferences, etc. Many employees at Managerial levels have simply stayed with the company for a decade (sometimes starting on the Hotel side) and have been systematically promoted/rewarded regardless of their competence or skill set that best suits the role. Perhaps most alarming, feedback given to HR is met with blank stares as if a robot received a programming error. Recently, the company decided to offer vacation accrual (because prior, no vacation was offered for an employee's first year). HR presented this change like some grand innovation when really, this is the bare minimum offered by companies country-wide. It's like someone getting the iPhone 3 and being really impressed with the new technology and having no clue that they're 7 generations behind. Another contradiction, the company maintains that they are the leader in entertainment and want to remain competitive in the space. Everyone I have spoken to at this company has admitted they took a significant pay cut to work for RHP.

How is it that a company so proud to reach the coveted title of ""Billion dollar company"" has so many elderly employees working for 8.25/hr, some of which have worked there for 47 years, that have never received a raise? They keep their non-corporate management in the dark which leads to confusion throughout all of the departments. Communication in general between departments is lacking. The non-corporate management dictated by the uncaring, unseen, arcane corporate side neglects being direct in instruction in order to perpetuate the faux family atmosphere of the staff. The staff themselves live up to these standards of family, but the management continually makes new and confusing policies that do the exact opposite. Company propaganda has recently been pushed through that at the very least asks the employees to memorize and recite the company motto, and they go as far as to ask employees to attend wellness fairs with health screenings-- that basically hands over their personal information to the company to use how they see fit. Pay is horrendous. Even after a small raise I was still well under the reasonable living wage in my area. The management above me was not fairing much better as well as the management above them. No one there is satisfied with what they are paid. Where is the money going? Meanwhile the CEO, gave himself a bonus in the higher end of six figures while his lowest level employees are working for poverty wages. There are more than one employees who are sexually harassing other employees, as well as guests, who have yet to be reprimanded or let go. One employee, who was gender non-conforming, only discussing it through their personal social media , was even shamed into leaving the company by other employees without anyone in management addressing the bullying. This was not an isolated incident. Don't be fooled by the faux positivity and friendly atmosphere, the closer you look the more sour it will become.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

PTO and benefits pretty generous, I was fortunate to receive great bonuses and some raises over the course of my two years there. Met some amazing people","Senior management thinks they're above everyone else. Advancement is few and far between. You can fulfill the role of the missing puzzle piece in property management and get told you're not good enough to get a promotion even though they tell you, you're doing a great job at your annual reviews. You can be doing all the spreadsheets, tenant engagement, and a ton of stuff that is not in your job description--however, the reason you can't be promoted is because you occasionally forget a comma or don't write the actual day of the week in an incident report. Nothing you do will be considered unless you out your coworkers and put on a front that you're good at your job. But, the people who have been there for significantly less time than you and who are the most complained about amongst the company regarding work ethic will get promotions. The company claims to care about opportunities for women and for people of color but at the end of the day, they don't really care it's all a front. There are no POC in property management (I say this as white indivual). If you're not blond haired and blue eyed or in a sorority or fraternity, it's very rare that you get put in the position of a client facing role. The company only cares about making money and looking good (this is valid). But, they do not care about how the mental health of their workers is affected. Someone close to you passes way? I'm so sorry but there's no bereavement period--not even one day. Sorry--you have to be right back at work the day of because SLG is more important than your personal life.",SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm

Information Technologies - Technical Analyst Role,1.0,"Oct 4, 2017",There's a few really talented members of the team that were great mentors.,"If you're looking at this role, be aware that this role is no where near as technical as it's made out to be in the interview. Work/Life Balance - Basically non existent. You're expected to be on call 24/7, be regularly updating tickets on nights and weekends, as well as being available for overtime everyday. While the expectation of any IT job is to be ready to put in extra hours, the expectation here leaves no time for any sort of balance. Every team meeting, the VP stated that the team needs to clear any upcoming plans outside of business hours, in order to be on stand by or to be on site. This became a regular demand, not a request. On top of this, vacation requests were routinely denied, with reasons cited that go against the company time off policy. It is frowned upon if you're not basically living from your desk. Leadership - The leadership of the Information Technologies is non-existent. There are some serious communication issues that are not being addressed, and in the span of 1 1/2 years, 4 members of the Information Technologies team have chosen to resign.

The mentality is always; I need this done now or why isn't this already done? with no forewarning or set expectation. Not a great culture to learn. This leads to - Poor morale and high turnover. The long hours and lack of communication have caused some departments to lose over half the staff in less than a year. Pushes work to the few who remain. - The above is fine if properly compensated or evaluated.

TPG Fort Worth is where dreams come to die,2.0,"Mar 28, 2021","-Everyone is interested in doing what’s right for investors -Great business- TPG is always ahead of the curve and thinking outside of the box -TPG hires great people. Just about everyone is intelligent and competent, and nice to work with -Senior management is out of San Francisco and holds high standards in terms of diversity and inclusion, which is heavily supported by FW management. The company is especially supportive of LGBT employees -The support employees give to charitable initiatives is truly heartwarming. There are some ongoing charities the firm supports, and employees go above and beyond to support these causes. For example- care packages for the troops, fundraising for the cystic fibrosis foundation, and a clothing drive for an LGBT teen homeless shelter showed everyone jumping in with their donations and their time -All the free food you can dream of (pre-pandemic) -Company is taking the pandemic seriously - everyone is working from home","-Massive divide between the “front office” (SF) and “back office” (FW). From the perspective of SF, back office is nothing and the only interaction between the two offices is through a few very senior individuals. There’s no understanding or appreciation of all the work that goes on in FW to support front office. -Crazy amounts of turnover. Considering that TPG has a great business, a respected name, pays well for the market, and hires the best, this shouldn’t be. -Crushingly hierarchical. Strong attitude by management that everyone should “stay in their place” and that only the most senior should have their voices heard. And even then, even the most senior often have no control over their careers. Job functions will change on the whims of management, even if it doesn’t make sense. Some of it has to do with the high amount of turnover, but uprooting the entire way the system works isn’t the way to plug a hole -While there are so many smart and competent people around, it’s more likely that an incompetent person who knows how to throw around business buzzwords and play the politics game will get promoted -I’ve never seen so many great people so beaten down by a place – management has no regards at all for the interests, background, or skill sets of employees. It doesn’t matter what you are hired to do- the job you were hired into can change out from under you out of nowhere, or you could be plucked out of your job at any moment and thrown into a new role you have no interest or experience in. Don’t get too comfortable with the manager who hired you- that’s very likely to change multiple times -Nothing ever improves- people are rarely left in a role long enough to become proficient and begin to improve the process and make things more efficient. Constant thrown-in learning mode. If someone doesn’t feel like doing something, they can just ignore it until everyone’s job changes again and it’s someone else’s problem. Manual processes galore thanks to expensive new systems put in that are only 90% of the way integrated -No training. Sink or swim mentality -Culture of fear. When something goes wrong (and it will) and it makes the “back office” look bad, management is very quick to point a finger at someone and fire them. Because of this blame culture, people are hesitant to take ownership of things. Because nobody takes ownership and jobs change so often, there’s a lot left up in that air that doesn’t end up getting done","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

We had a very good working relationship.

Great benefits but...,3.0,"Aug 18, 2015","In general, people are very nice if you talk to them (don't expect people to go out of their way to get to know you though) High quality company benefits: Top notch healthcare Lunch provided every day 401K Salary + bonus","No corporate culture. At all. Very hierarchical. Administrative staff at the very bottom of the chain and indirectly, made to feel that way. Perks abound at all levels but not if you are an admin (firm conferences, new hire dinners, team building retreats...not if you are an admin). Huge dichotomy between investment teams and administrative professionals. Very little (almost zero) training. A few sessions are offered here and there for new technologies, but don't expect any new hire training as an admin. You'll receive an administrative handbook, desk, computer and access to all the supplies you need, but there is no ramp up and no formal new hire training for administrative staff. None. As a result, people are left to sink or swim and sadly, some good people leave b/c they weren't afforded the resources or time to find their feet. High turnover. Mostly admins seem to be fed up or find something more interesting, in light of all the benefits and pay. Senior management doesn't seem to know anything about what the administrative staff experiences and they don't inquire about it either. Some tenured administrative assistants have moved up the chain in to interesting roles, but that is few and far between. Overall, if you are an admin and corporate culture is important to you, then this is not the place. I cannot speak for the investment teams that seem to bond and get together frequently at sponsored events.","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

A dichotomy of both good and horrifically bad,2.0,"Mar 17, 2021","Perks were good when in the office. Exposure to new and changing things within PE. It's a dynamic work environment and not a place where you'll be bored to tears. There are some great people here, but also some atrocious personalities.","Where to begin... it can be extremely political. It's not who you hitch your wagon to, but who they hitch your wagon to. You will watch people continue to get promoted not necessarily for their skills/knowledge, but because they are visible and have a director who fights for them. Other directors and senior managers will deliberately hold people back from progressing in their careers. Some junior to early management level staff go above and beyond and the response from upper management is ""that's what is expected"" while others just do their job and are deemed to be promotable. They'll also promote you if they think you're going to quit, so people have successfully played that card (something to consider). There is no sense of development of skills and knowledge. No true and comprehensive training. They want people to stay in the position they are in because it's too difficult to replace them. They will say that the firm promotes and encourages lateral movement between teams, but that is seldom the case, and they will likely pay recruiters heaps of money to hire externally before ever considering someone internally. Many of the senior managers and managers are not true ""managers"" or leaders; they are subject matter experts on their funds, and have little ability to grow, develop, and teach the people reporting to them. The culture is very poor under a thinly veiled attempt at fun and friendly. Be very ready to be thrown under the bus by your Manager/Sr. Manager if something goes wrong, and for them to withhold promotion because of it.

Company that challenges you everyday,4.0,"Mar 23, 2019","This company is a challenge, and if you meet that challenge head on and give them 110% of your effort you will be rewarded. We are extremely tech savvy, implementing software and efficiencies on a regular basis to keep up with the times. If you don't know excel and aren't good with adapting to change then this is not the company for you. Senior management is demanding, and most likely know the answer before they even ask you the question, which only challenges you to be on top of your game at a moments notice. I am putting this in the pros section, because I firmly believe it has made me a better/stronger/efficient employee. With regards to the comments in other reviews about Vornado employees getting fired/let go... from what I have witnessed, they weren't making the cut because most of them were unwilling to accept the changes that the company needed to make in order to complete in the retail market, so I wouldn't read to far into that. As long as you don't abuse it, they are flexible with you working from home when needed (kids sick/doctors appointment/etc.)",- Health insurance could be better. - Work/Life balance isn't always high priority among senior management - overtime during busy times is expected - overloaded with work at times.,Urban Edge Properties,UE,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Urban-Edge-Properties-Reviews-E1266179.htm

The marketing team and our supervisors (Katie, Susan, and Nicole) provided great support annd encouragement to our department. Even during challenging times, especially during budget buts and company-wide layoffs, it felt like we were able to communicate any struggles with our supervisors and were met with the appropriate support. - The benefits and company culture made the corporate employees feel appreciated. While the workload could be rigorous during certain seasons of peak projects, the effort didn’t go unnoticed.","- Unfortunately, Veris and HR specifically has a lot of growing to do when it comes to handling situations involving ADA/disabilities. My accommodations request was treated with a lot of disrespect and unethical practice. After medical leave and what turned into a contentious battle with HR, I was unable to return to work. - There was a lot of tension between certain departments while others worked very closely. It almost felt clique-y depending on which department you were a part of/worked with. - There was an obvious disconnect between the corporate teams and on-site teams.

"Dishonest Leadership, Toxic Culture – Beware",1.0,"Aug 13, 2025",Free brunches at the end of the month.,"This company has a serious transparency problem — both internally and externally. Many honest, critical reviews on this site have mysteriously disappeared over time, which is why you’re likely not seeing the full picture. If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance this review will also be deleted, just like the others that dared to speak the truth. The work culture at WhiteStone REIT is toxic, fear-driven, and unsustainable. The constant pressure, hostility, and lack of support took a real toll on my health — so much so that I ended up in the hospital for 10 days. No job should ever push an employee to that point, yet leadership here shows no concern for employee well-being. The Chief People Officer in particular operates with alarming dishonesty. After my departure, she attempted to twist facts and submit misleading information to block my unemployment benefits. Thankfully, the truth came out and I was awarded benefits, but no one should have to go through such a vindictive process after already enduring a damaging workplace. The company’s downward spiral is not just internal. Their stock has been in sharp decline since the beginning of the year, reflecting the poor decisions and lack of effective leadership at the top. High turnover, low morale, and retaliation against those who speak up are the norm. If you value your health, career, and integrity, avoid WhiteStone REIT. The truth is hidden behind carefully curated PR and removed reviews — but the problems are very real.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Poor Culture and Lack of Support,1.0,"Sep 7, 2025",Some of the benefits are decent.,"My experience at Whitestone REIT was unfortunately very negative. The work environment felt disorganized and unsupportive, and communication from leadership was often unclear. Employee development and recognition were minimal, which made it difficult to feel valued or motivated. The culture leaned more toward stress and frustration than collaboration, and opportunities for growth were limited. While the company may be a fit for some, in my opinion there are healthier and more supportive workplaces out there.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Great Outlook,5.0,"Jun 22, 2023","CSuite genuinely cares about their employees. They go above and beyond to try to accommodate everyone, no matter the title or rank. Bad reviews prior to the CEO change in 2022 may have some validity. Post leadership change, they are from bad apples that have benefited for too long doing below the bare minimum. Those that continue to criticize the COO or the company in general, need to take a step back and realize that accountability fosters professionalism and more efficiency. The problem isn’t the COO or Whitestone, it’s you. Instead of taking everything personally and retaliating with petty reviews, look at ways of improving your skills and work ethic and lessen your ego. I have found a work family here and look forward to coming to the office. Never have felt this way about a job before.",There’s a few bad apples left that management still sees potential in.

"Toxic, Manipulative Management",1.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Hotel discounts Occasional free lunches,"Management is not receptive to new ideas, nor do they respect boundaries. I requested we discontinue using a group texting chat (on personal phones) for communication between approximately twenty-five staff members and instead use Teams, a software already used by the team. This would streamline communication and allow for boundaries around personal time. Management dismissed this idea. After leaving the company, I was still receiving texts from that group chat. Management does not listen to or respect support staff. Parent company received violent threats against their newspaper company, which was in the suite next door. I told my boss, I was not comfortable working from the office & I would like to finish the day from home. She said I was the only one who felt that way, and declined my request. Days later, the CEO hired armed security to protect his family and office, and we all worked from home for the following weeks until the threat was dissolved. The way she treated me with such manipulation and dismissal has stuck with me nearly 1.5 years later. Senior staff members were consistently late to meetings with support staff and frequently did not show up at all. The office was a very loud environment with senior staff speaking loudly around the cubicle area, filled with support staff. My work was disturbed and needlessly interrupted multiple times a day. There was even a day the SVPs were loudly cheering on the World Cup game, merely feet away from my cubicle. I requested a hybrid schedule to partially remove the office interruptions for my productivity, and it took 2 weeks to receive any feedback, and then declined altogether. After leaving the company, I learned my replacement was fully remote. Employees, including the president, consistently commented things like “leaving already?!” at my departure at the end of the scheduled, contracted work day.",Ashford Hospitality Trust,AHT,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ashford-Inc-Reviews-E16208.htm
