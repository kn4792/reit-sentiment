"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",3.0,"Nov 27, 2017","There is no better place to learn real estate. You will be working with dynamic real estate professionals who know and love what they do. Free gym onsite, free parking, kitchen with free coffee and sodas. Free breakfast weekly. Many parties and other activities with coworkers. Truly casual dress from the top down.","No telecommuting even though most support staff positions are perfect candidates. Unless you are upper management you will work in an 80's era cubicle. Consultants and auditors work crammed together in windowless conference rooms. So-so benefits and a three year vesting cliff for 401k matches.

High rate of turnover.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
Outstanding Leaders,4.0,"Apr 17, 2017","Federal hasn't gained its reputation for no reason. It is a company that challenges the status quo, makes sound decisions with the long-term vision always in mind and excellence can be seen in everything we do. I attribute all this to upper management; we are truly surrounded by industry superstars that you can learn a lot from. You just have to make it a point to do this. Also, the sense of pride in belonging to FRIT is a huge plus.","Although it is admirable that we are technically small in size for all we do, that has its downsides. In my opinion, systems and technology are in desperate need for improvement (investing in efficiency will pay off in the long run), middle management needs to be carefully chosen (ability to manage needs to be looked at vs. years of service) and we must invest in more personnel (most departments seem to be spread too thin which makes it difficult for talented employees to think outside the box, shine and grow)",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
"Most people are great, Benefits are awesome, Still give bonuses in this economic climate",4.0,"Mar 5, 2015","I really liked the personalities of most of the people I worked with. The work load was doable and there was minimal supervision, and when questions arose, they were answered promptly. The benefits are second to none. I was impressed that employees still received bonuses and raises, given the economic climate.","When there are people underperforming, they are not reprimanded. At times, it seems like mediocrity is tolerated or sometimes encouraged. There was not any cross-department transitions, however much they emphasize it. While there are annual raises, the initial salary is low compared to similar positions at other companies.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
"An already excellent company, continuously striving to be better.",4.0,"Apr 12, 2017","What initially drew me to FRIT were its local properties, which change, grow and change again. It seemed that improvement was a priority, and after working here, I still believe that is so. This is a place people come and often stay. It is the least gossipy atmosphere I have ever worked in; friendly and real. FRIT mgmt. tries to listen, promote from within and to assist those who show interest in advancing.","Probably the biggest ""con"" is also a big ""pro"" - longevity. Some people who've been here for years are eager and willing to change as needed, others forget to listen to those who have outside experience.

Truly a great place to work,5.0,"Jan 23, 2018","I've been given so many opportunities to learn and grow over the years. The team is generally lean which has given me the opportunity to be exposed to more than I would likely be exposed to elsewhere. Federal is fast paced, fun and there is a true sense of family among the team. Federal promotes a culture of out of the box thinking. The leadership team is open to listening to new ideas. Overall, there is a sense that people at Federal Realty not only care about the success of the company but they also genuinely care about one another. This is truly a great place to work. Pros: Competitive salary, excellent benefits, free bagels on Wednesday, free sodas, drinks, good coffee options, fun holiday parties and picnics, great leadership team.",There is not always a vertical career path given the size of the company.,Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
"Big corporate scope, but limited insight",3.0,"May 11, 2018","FRIT engages in a lot of complex transactions and acquisitions, and has public company reporting requirements so everything is done by the book. This provides good opportunity for exposure in these areas but you have to fight for it. Health insurance was good and there are several events/occasions where employees are shown appreciation. Coworkers were friendly.","If you are ambitious, you better be patient too. Did not seem like there was any room for promotion. Turnover is high because of this (e.g. read the other reviews).

They will spend money on projects and do things that others cannot b/c FRIT carries so little property-secured debt.,"Unnecessary culture of fear and favorites played.

Lucky for them the locations attract good tenants.","Does not listen to front line employees, executives seem to always know better and turn a blind eye when negative thing are brought to their attention. Executives, you should take the time to talk to your PM’s one on one and don’t leave it up to the poorly run HR Department, they kinda suck. Company wastes tons of money by its failure to communicate with their managers, company could pay its REIT investors soooo much more dividends if they would slow down just a bit and concentrate, stop thinking you are so smart and look a little closer at your employees you think are so great, they are not as good as you think. Company looses so many good quality hard working folks due to their unwillingness to listen and try to adjust a little when issues are pointed out. Top officials should be ashamed for taking so much compensation while they continue to allow great people to leave. Exit interviews conducted are a joke. Take time to talk to your tenants, you may be surprised at how negative they will be regarding their treatment by the company, lastly, if you are a tenant you should exercise your option to audit your CAM if your lease allows, you will be stunned at what you might find.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm

"Good for shareholders, bad for employees.",2.0,"May 5, 2024","Mostly nice people, good stock performance.","FRIT openly admits that they ask for very high performance from their employees while paying less than competitors. In other words, employees are overworked and underpaid. But that's essential for them to maintain their competitive advantage as the REIT with the longest record of annual dividend rate increases. They will do whatever it takes to hold onto that record, including laying off employees when the workload actually calls for additional hires. Most jobs with FRIT are not secure, especially in the current market. They are also transparent about their expectations that you perform the duties of a higher position before getting a promotion or raise. FRIT expects you to prove you can do the work first to earn that higher title and pay. However, they tend to take advantage of this and let employees continue to do extra work without giving them that promotion. They're walking a fine line with the legality of this practice, but they always come up with excuses to make it seem legitimate and justified. Shareholders can feel pretty secure about their investment choice. Employees should recognize that they'll never be prioritized and find a workplace that can provide them with a better environment. One problem with the workload at FRIT is a major lack of systems. Their business processes have not grown as fast as their portfolio. They operate with outdated and inefficient methods and their offices/teams are disconnected from each other. This leaves employees too overwhelmed with tedious daily tasks to achieve any kind of innovation. The management says they're open to new ideas but they do not foster an environment that allows for developing new methods, trying things that could prove unsuccessful, or time available to review any recommendations. Those who do try to focus on innovation don't last long with FRIT. FRIT does have good people; Many smart business people who mean well and executives who are actually approachable. They have lots of loyal employees who stick around because they remember how good things were when it was a smaller company (or they just don't have the time/initiative to find a new job). Unfortunately, the good intentions of FRIT don't translate to creating a good work environment. I would not recommend working at FRIT.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
"Solid performance, but horrible employee retention and moral.",2.0,"May 7, 2010","REIT understands its bottom line and is focused on results. Could be a fantastic company to work for if the firm intelligently communicated and invested in its employees. Unfortunately, this is its achilles heel.","Disfunctional interoffice communication. Poor training. Horrendous employee retention rate. While sr. mgt. is great at attaining company directives, little effort is invested in cultivating or motivating performing talent. Many talented individuals leave due to the firm's inability to communicate honestly in a forthright manner. Although senior mgt is for the most part talented, certain key roles are currently posted by ""pretenders"". A solid firm should be able to recognize such liabilities and root them out.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
A well run Retail REIT,4.0,"Mar 3, 2010",Great opportunity to really understand a well run Retail REIT. Employees and colleagues are professional and respectful of one another.,"The management style from the top down is one that is focused on results more than people. In this economy, the company is less of a risk taker than it has been in the past, which is good for shareholders and probably good for long term stability, but hard on the people who are working there.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
The company does excellent work but demands a lot from its employees and rewards high achievers.,4.0,"Oct 15, 2011","Pays well, smart management, good benefits, good growth opportunities. It's a good place to work for ambitious, hard-working individuals, who are team players and are prepared to work a lot.","This is not specific to this company, but it has a sink or swim mentality. If you're not excellent you might be summarily terminated - but that's not surprising.",Federal Realty Investment Trust,FRT,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Federal-Realty-Investment-Trust-Reviews-E248.htm
