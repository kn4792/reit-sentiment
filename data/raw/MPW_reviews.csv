Great Compensation but Toxic Culture,1.0,"May 28, 2025",Best available medical benefits at extremely low cost to the employee. Really good base pay and generous annual bonus.,Toxic culture that starts at the top. A lot of nepotism. They rule their employees through fear and threats.

The PTO is not great.,Medical Properties Trust Inc.,MPW,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Medical-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E37806.htm
Outlook is not looking good,1.0,"Jan 12, 2025",Benefits were some of the best that I’ve seen.,"Fear based culture, not family friendly, coworkers seemed unhappy, subpar portfolio of tenants that seem to have regular liquidity issues. Employees seem to be younger and more impressionable. They’ve never worked in a good culture so don’t know any better. Only like to promote within.",Medical Properties Trust Inc.,MPW,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Medical-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E37806.htm
Toxic work environment,1.0,"May 15, 2024",They pay very well and have great benefits,"The work environment is very toxic. They manage with fear and intimidation. No encouragement or appreciation.

Friends and family members of the CEO are assured to get a job and promotions, while doing NOTHING!!!",Medical Properties Trust Inc.,MPW,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Medical-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E37806.htm
Horrible Company Horrible Culture,1.0,"Mar 29, 2024",Benefits are amazing and low cost to employees.,This place is horrible.
