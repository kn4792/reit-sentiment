Slowly dying company time to go to pasture,1.0,"Sep 18, 2021",A spin out of the now defunct Highland Capital Management. It is great to be back at the Crescent. Some cool coworkers but most are poor quality individuals.,"Compensation is well below market. Zero opportunity for growth yes it will be touted but is nonexistent. Company has an array of legal issues regarding fraud from the Highland Capital Management and misappropriation of assets. Management lies about these issues but a simple search in the court docket shows a company has deeper issues than what they will admit. I will be shocked if NexPoint is in business in 24 months. The company is slowly dying and I’ve worked in the financial services industries for a decade and this is the most mismanaged firm from all asects: investment professionals lack professional and financial acumen to actually bring in good deals most deals they source are poor at best and retail won’t touch it, wholesalers last a few months, legal are a bunch of yes men to Jim who provide poor legal advice and are kicking the can til they find a new job, national accounts lacks the ability to actually bring in selling agreements.

Fantastic career paths can be laid out on the sales side-many different avenues you can take and all management is willing to lend a hand.

Lack of communication is horribly obnoxious. Company continues to try to grow without having a stable foundation. CEO throws his power around and affects the entire company poorly.

Better oportunites elsewhere,1.0,"May 2, 2025",Working with your team. not much esle,As an area manager your day is typically spent putting out fires. You are dragged to and fro just trying to stay afloat with constant immediate priority task. Your nights will be spent trying to catch up on administrative work from the day before. your weekends are spent on adminstrative and payroll based task as well as answering priorty calls from the call center. You will not have a day off. You are expected to be in stores all day monday through friday. They strongly encourage you to be in stores saturday. If one of your managers are off you are expected to cover that store. if more than one is off you are expected to cover all of them. All your stores will have low staffing and few if any contengency managers. Culture is toxic overall. It is focused on accountability particularly for regional managers or below. The only excuse why something did not get completed is that you failed and nothing else matters. Need to be in 3 different places at once and work 16 plus hours days. Thats not an excuse not to get another thing done. They will send you out test asking you take a picture in front of an object in front of your store within 30 minutes to verify you are there. Upper management is obsessed with change. you will constantly get bombarded with new systems and processes. These are not veted before you get them so there will be bugs. Current push is mobility. AMs no longer get laptops or cellphones. Everything must be done through a tablet or an AM's personal phone.,National Storage Affiliates,NSA,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/National-Storage-Affiliates-Reviews-E2469764.htm

They have been unable to assist me in rolling over my 401k for almost a year since I was let go. They don’t respond to emails about the matter and when they do they barely read the email that I sent to them. Also management is generally cliquey and immature. I was fired after less than 4 months without ever having a serious conversation with a manager. You might think I’m exaggerating but I’m not. The week before I was fired the director personally told me I was doing well. The next time I saw him they were terminating my for “performance reasons.” They never went into detail past that. Even after me asking just for feedback, wanting to know what I did wrong so I wouldn’t do it again, they never told me.

Employees who'd been there a super long time are always put above others. Their turn over average was one year at corporate.

Only if you’re desperate for a job come here.,1.0,"Jan 23, 2024","The people are nice, and the pay is good. That’s really it.","So just a side note that is review only pertains to the Berkeley office. Other Outfront offices do things differently, so I can’t say anything about them. Unfortunately the general manager to this location isn’t that great. He’s a nice guy, however he’s very unpredictable and unprepared. He doesn’t have a good plan for new hires, and expects them to know everything on their first week. He also shuffles his employees around to several other people, and they’re not given a heads up from the GM on how to help them. He’s also not transparent, and will leave out a lot of important details during the job interviews. He also doesn’t allow some employees to do their jobs, and will do it himself instead of giving them a chance. The office itself is also not ready and still under construction. The GM doesn’t really care that the noise and debris is bothering some employees and expects them to still show up to work, even under uncomfortable circumstances. The ceilings and walls keep leaking from the rains, and it’s uncomfortable for some employees to work with. The building also isn’t really up to code, and it looks like they cut some corners. For example, if you have a disability you won’t be able to work upstairs with everyone else because there’s no elevator. You’ll have to stay downstairs where it’s freezing cold, and not handicap accessible. IT takes forever to assist you to help, and the laptops are kind of out date. Bonuses are hardly given out, and there’s really no perks offered. Quite a bit of turnover here, as well. And the benefits are super expensive.

Unprofessional and hostile work environment,1.0,"Aug 3, 2023",Competitive salary and decent benefits.,"I worked at OUTFRONT for three months. I wanted to share my experiences working for this company to help inform others considering working here. I was discharged from my cybersecurity position after just over three months of employment. I was given a performance review where I was given a plan to improve my performance. Then, less than a week later, I was terminated on the spot with no warning. My manager asked me for a quick ""chat."" When I joined the call, he told me someone else was joining, which I hadn't been informed of prior to the call. Then an HR representative joined the call and immediately told me I was being terminated. When they were about to end the call, I asked if I could give my input. They told me they don't usually allow employees being terminated to speak up, but I did anyway. I told them that it was unethical what they were doing and told them how I felt about my experiences. I then left the call. In my experience at OUTFRONT, I felt the work environment was unprofessional and hostile. My manager would regularly adopt a combative stance against everyone on calls and emails, he would regularly raise his voice and swear at us, say belittling comments to me about my work (e.g. criticize me for not rolling out a simulated phishing awareness campaign on time, despite him shelving the task for two years), and almost never gave any praise to anyone for their accomplishments. In my performance review, he criticized me for my self assessment in which I said I try hard to create an inclusive environment for all races, genders, religions, and creeds. However, he himself had not hired anyone except for white men. Out of the whole team of 15 or so people, we had 1 woman and fewer than 5 non-white employees. Despite claiming he had tried to create an inclusive environment, his team was composed overwhelmingly of white men. As a new employee fairly new in my career, I was given no chance whatsoever to improve my performance and grow in my career. I had never received any written or verbal warnings or detected any signs of disapproval from management for my performance. After my one and only performance review, I was falsely led to believe I would have tome to improve my performance. I felt I was in a cutthroat environment in which the communication between managers and engineers was lacking, good work was not praised, and every mistake was harshly criticized. I do not recommend working in this company to anyone. I was terminated right on the spot with no other job lined up and given no time whatsoever to improve my performance. I had no salary, no health benefits, and it took me months to find a new job to be able to support myself. It was an extremely upsetting and stressful experience for me and I an thankful I found a professional and respectful work environment afterwards.",OUTFRONT Media Inc.,OUT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Outfront-Media-Reviews-E930001.htm

Still About 40 years Behind - Both in Culture and Technology,2.0,"Apr 16, 2020",Salaried employees are paid pretty well. Good 401K benefits.

Management has absolutely zero interest in technology - even though they sure pretend to in pitch meetings to clients. Meanwhile, the inventory tracking system runs on a platform from the 80s. You literally open up to a black screen with a blinking neon green cursor. I feel like I might as well be in an SNL sketch. When I left at the end of 2019, they still did not even have Salesforce ... they said they were just about to launch it when I started in 2016. When the possibility of actually moving the company into the 21st century is raised to management there is a lot of push back from high level sales people who just feel more comfortable selling the same billboard the same way they've been selling it for the past 15 years.

Toxic Culture That Destroys Morale and Wellbeing,1.0,"Sep 11, 2025",One manager at the site level genuinely cared and tried to support their team. Talented coworkers who do their best despite the environment. Strong name recognition.,"This is not just a “high-pressure sales job.” It’s a culture built on fear, intimidation, and exhaustion. The division prioritizes metrics over people, and it shows in every aspect of the employee experience. Fear Over Feedback: Speaking up is dangerous. Employees who voice concerns are quickly labeled as negative or a “problem.” HR is not a safe option, and feedback sessions are tightly controlled to avoid real criticism. Unrealistic Metrics: Success is measured by spreadsheets, not actual effort or customer experience. Performance standards are punishing and often based on factors outside employees’ control. Call Distribution Games: Leads are not distributed evenly. Some get better calls while others are left with recycled, low-quality prospects—yet everyone is held to the same national targets. The system is fundamentally unfair. Health Toll: The stress here is extreme. Employees report anxiety, burnout, sleeplessness, and the feeling that work consumes their lives. The lack of acknowledgment from leadership only deepens the damage. Revolving Door: Turnover is constant. People leave burned out and disillusioned. Many return briefly out of necessity, only to leave again once they find something healthier.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

You’re thrown in blind and blamed when you sink. • Non-tenure lasts ~3 months. Sounds safe—until your last non-tenured month rolls over and drags down your first three months of tenure. You’re haunted by numbers you had no chance to escape. • Calls are a trap: you can lock as many as you want, but if they don’t fund, you’re accused of “costing the company” thousands. Instead of coaching, you get public shaming. • Leadership is chaos. Some managers hide, others panic, all live in fear. Genuine support is extinct. The culture is built on intimidation, finger-pointing, and fear. • Toxicity is woven into every metric. You can fund loans and still be told you’re failing. The system is designed to chew you up and spit you out. • Upcoming comp plan change—expect to work harder each year for less.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Wizard of OZ,1.0,"Sep 20, 2025","Stress, wrinkles and annoying managers","Working at PennyMac was a highly discouraging experience. The culture is heavily micromanaged, leaving little room for trust or autonomy. Compensation is below industry standards, and the workload is consistently overwhelming due to chronic understaffing. Employees are expected to take on far more than is reasonable, which quickly leads to burnout and frustration. Opportunities for career growth are minimal, and employee well-being doesn’t seem to be a priority.

You miss one word and you are hit with a critical fail, which not only places you in the termination pile-but the company then keeps your commission on that loan when it funds. Technology that is spotty at best, taking up to 30 minutes simply to get logged into the system. If you're more than 5 minutes late logging in to your shift, you are written up -all because Pennymacs servers are bogged down and won't let you in. Multiple months in which I would miss hitting 125% payouts on commission by 1 funding unit-only to see that unit literally fund the very next day on the 1st of the next month.

"Training is horrible, access to data takes forever",1.0,"Apr 16, 2024","I liked the culture, most people were friendly","I worked there for only a month, and wasn't able to even start doing my job for 2 weeks due to bad training and no access to the data that I required. The team I worked with was on a hybrid schedule, so they worked M-F in office, then Th- Fri were from home. I was only trained a couple of hours a day for the first 3 days I was there, then left to figure it out. This means figuring out a new system, new processes, etc. The Processes and Procedures was horribly written and left out a lot of important material, especially if you got an Error message which happened a lot with the horrible system they use, so on Thursdays and Fridays I tried using them when I was finally given work to do, but made mistakes due to the P/P's missing a whole lot of information. Then if I wanted to ask a question I got dirty looks and slow answers to my questions. When I was let go I still didn't have access to all of the databases that I needed, (it took them 2 weeks just to get me a phone) so I don't feel like they even gave me a chance to prove myself, and the team lead seemed like she didn't want to help or answer any questions. But then when I made a mistake she was all over me for it, and not in a positive way. I appreciate feedback when it is constructive, but they way she did it was demeaning and demoralizing. I was moving work along by the 3rd week and completing the tasks they gave me, and doing my best to figure it out on my own, but that wasn't enough I guess. Some of they other teams seemed to work together, this team didn't want to help or work as a team. If I asked the manager for help, which wasn't often because she was so busy, I would get a patronizing look and answer, like "" you should know this"". Well, if I would have had real training and P&P's that were written well, I wouldn't have to be asking you questions. would I?",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

The local government issued mandatory emergency evacuations and told people to stay home. The US government suspended mail service. Bridges in the Tampa Bay area were closed to traffic, as well as city streets. Yet Pennymac told us to ignore these orders and come into the office. We are constantly told how important employees are, but we only seem to matter when we're closing loans, not when you and your family's safety is on the line.

A Company Trying to be New School with Old School Toxicity,2.0,"Sep 8, 2023",There's hybrid flexibility for most roles. I would say the pay is decent. Work-life balance is ok to a point. There is some attempt at employee engagement but I did not see a lot in my time there.,"There was a major focus on production for my role, which was not clearly defined as a production role when I agreed to the position. Loans reviewed per hour are heavily scrutinized by management in order to maximize employee productivity. Failing to hit a certain number per hour meant that an employee would be reprimanded for productivity. The department's ultimate goal is to have a team of 2 to 3 employees do as much as possible within a workday, rather than employing the appropriate number of employees to handle the workload. The end result is employees become micromanaged to ensure that a rigid production schedule is met that isn't necessary and can be obtained by other means. When the workload is very heavy, other departments are often recruited to help disposition files. As one may have guessed, the end result is that many arbitrary errors are found when the files are reviewed. There is no consistency about what the job is meant to be or how day-to-day processes should be conducted between frontline employees, middle management, and top management. Front-line specialists may have. completely different understanding of how certain scenarios should be handled than management. Because of this, new employees may become frustrated or confused because of the different answers that may receive when asking questions. Management lacks actual managerial skills and many are in leadership roles due to being high producers in their past positions. This is a common trope within the mortgage industry, and it would even seem like an appropriate idea if managers were expected to produce just as their subordinates are. However, this is not the case. Managers in this department are strictly salaried supervisors and their expectations are to lead, coach, and give feedback. Since they were promoted for past production and not their potential to motivate and influence employees, they lack the necessary skills to accomplish their intended goal. The end result is that there is a hyper-fixation on production with little to no feedback detailing how to improve or a realistic view that some days production can vary. Essentially middle management views their position as literal micromanagement, leading to a toxic work culture. From personal experience, not only was my hourly production monitored closely, but my emails were monitored by management to ensure screenshots looked appropriate. There are also times when I was reprimanded for not answering an email quickly enough, even when the email had been received within 30 minutes and not marked as urgent. Not only is severe micromanagement an issue, but some managers have no way to conduct themselves in the office. My manager made a habit of frequent inappropriate remarks/stories. These ranged from stories of drug use to a remark made regarding a physical I had requested PTO for.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

I Was Warned…,3.0,"May 15, 2023",- I had THEE absolute BEST manager on the PLANET (RW) and I honestly couldn’t have handpicked a better group of coworkers. - Decent benefits - Decent pay - Received a promotion while working from home,"*sigh* - As trainers, we were on a rolling 6 week class schedule with literally ZERO time off. When I first began, I went five months without so much as a half day to go to a doctor’s appointment. Every trainer was on this schedule, so there was no opportunity for backup or standby in case the primary trainer had any kind of emergency. I worked sick, with a broke down car in my garage that I couldn’t take to the shop…yeah. - No continuity with the line of business. Our procedures and manuals were embarrassingly outdated and I always felt horrible knowing that the information we were giving participants would be COMPLETELY different once they actually started doing the work. - We were forced to turn in report cards weekly to track individual improvement…not the easiest feat when there are 20 people in your class - and again, you don’t have any type of help. - I went on leave and had to email HR and ask them when I was returning. They took three days to answer me. I returned on the day they gave me, reached out to them and again…three days of nothing. Once they finally acknowledged me, I received a check with two instead of five days of pay because THEY chose to disregard the fact that I was there. - Everything had changed when I returned. We’d returned to the office and gone to a “modular” training style, where we could share one another’s load and not train every single day. Seemed cool, but I wondered why we had to come into the office if we 1) were still training virtually, and 2) not working on a particular day. No joke…out of a 6 week class, I was only scheduled to train 4 days - but was still expected to come in the office every day (in terrible traffic)? Made NO sense. I would go to work, literally sit and do nothing, and go home. I’d ask for extra work/projects to no avail. - What kind of company pushes their employees to go back into the office when gas prices were literally the highest in HISTORY?! A California based company at that, where gas prices are the highest! Completely insensitive and callous call. Also, I was told that going back into the office helped with revenue for the county/city…but I live in the same county/city as the building, so they could have kept that lie for somebody else. - Of the three departments in our division, one was totally remote and the other was Hybrid. It was hard not to take having to come in daily (again, most days for nothing) personally. We kept hearing “PennyMac is a WFO company”, but kept pulling up to a half empty building every day. Whatever the COMPANY is doing, that’s what the COMPANY as a WHOLE needs to do. - Three hours of vacation a paycheck is an absolute joke. You have to work a year just to get a week’s vacation. It’s insane!!!! And I’ve heard “HR is working on it” since I got there in 2019.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Must Avoid,1.0,"May 5, 2023",You can make a lot of money quickly. Many of my coworkers were nice people,"I was originally part of the college development program. If you’re a student this company is a must avoid. They constantly lie to tell you how great of a company they are and how going to any other company to do the job would be a mistake. This was my first red flag here. In my 6 months as a loan officer for Pennymac I had 3 different managers. My first one I was in office still in training and they put me on the only remote team there. Following that they demoted my manager and put me on an in office team, only to demote my manager again. Finally I was put on a more secure team although management at that point was all micromanagement. The work life balance is terrible. Overtime is not optional or is required by the company although they disguise it as optional. The recruiter who hired me told me multiple different lies that I then realized we’re not true when I came to the job. There is tons of micromanagement at the company and upper management always plays favorites. Unless you are a favorite, don’t expect to be treated well by anyone there. The office culture is horrible. The people working there never faced consequences for making jokes about other employees that were often times hurtful and terrible to even witness. I’ve witnessed people out loud make school shooter jokes and racist jokes about other employees and everything is shrugged off. I almost felt uncomfortable speaking to others in the office as I did not want to be at the end of a joke they found humorous that I found offensive. Our site (tampa) constantly finished the lowest of any site for production and this isn’t because of the loan officers there. This is because of the poor management spearheaded by the site lead who proceeded to mismanage the site from the moment I was there. If you’re looking for a place of employment you feel comfortable in, I would avoid Pennymac at all costs unless you find racism and hatred a part of your daily life. I’m glad I no longer work for Pennymac as it was the worst choice I could have ever made graduating university.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Additionally, if you're a new hire and you don't meet their unrealistic goals the ""bonus"" they give you will have to be paid back too.

Upper management has an extremely adversarial stance against all internal governance efforts; to the point that they browbeat you into removing findings from reports. They are compensated for not having findings, so rather than work on fixing anything, they just fight and whine until they are removed off reports. Everyone loses when that happens. On a personal note they expected 60 hrs a week to be normal starting point, so a normal work-life balance was impossible; and I had recently been laid off my prior job so they brought me in at 2 levels lower and a severely cut paycheck because they knew they could take advantage of my situation. It wasn't until I resigned, and they realized just how much I brought to the table, that they attempted to bring me back to a level near what I had previous.

Pretty good or kinda lame depending on department,3.0,"Mar 10, 2022","If you are not working on the production side of things, you will enjoy good work life balance. I actually really enjoyed the first three years at PennyMac in the office before they closed down two other offices and crammed everyone in. WLB was great, and I didn't mind the lower salary because of that. Once I switched to production, WLB was not always great, and we were often asked to work weekends and work past 5. Mind-numbing multi-hour meetings were also the norm. Final Assessment: If you're early on in your programming career, this is a good place to build some experience and then bounce. If you're later in your career, it's a good place to coast until you retire.","- Will not allow fully remote workers - Less than market rate salary. As a senior, you can expect to make 40k less than the current average - Kind of a boring industry to be in, and it's often difficult to bridge the gap of understanding between the ""business people"" and the programmers unless you already have knowledge of this industry - Working on production = working on the weekends, a million slack channels with people fighting fires, 1+ hour long zoom calls. - Periodic layoffs - Every month you have to do these boring compliance training courses that take at least an hour and have jack squat to do with your job",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

I'll start by saying there is absolutely no job security. People get fired or laid-off all the time on the whim of management. Stan and the other executives will fire anyone and everyone who is not in the C-suite if it will save them a dollar. The company swings from one focus to another depending on what can earn the executives the most money. One day they're focused on servicing, the next on technology, then commercial. Whole groups are turned over or transferred without warning. PennyMac has horrible benefits. They don't care about there employees so why provide benefits? Again, the only thing that matters is how much money can the executives make. Employees are costs to them. The place is basically an arena for unemployable Countrywide Home Loans / BofA alumni to reunite. Bonuses are promised and never paid. The 401K plan doesn't let you in until 1 year of service.

I have done loan processing before and PennyMac has another idea of what it is. Most of out customers are upset because they are confused on who to speak to.

There are some cool people working here,but your common hate for your management isn't a healthy environment enough to stay.","Nepotism runs rampant. Managers in the tax department sleep around with each other and hire and promote their friends from past employers. Everyone higher up is related to someone either by blood or marriage. The Nepotism is horrendous and the vibe is very high school clique. ""Yes"" people get promoted yet complain about their management. Management makes up their own way of how things should be processed without consulting the actual employees doing the work. The company is a joke and human resources does nothing to investigate the horrible management even when entire departments quit.

I've been there and the process can be overwhelming, so the mission became really important to me.","There's constant change in management and direction. So that mission that you signed on for? Sometimes you're able to work toward it and sometimes it doesn't really matter. At the end of the day, it's about the company being profitable - just like most companies out there. You are literally treated like a child and god forbid if you are paid salary - that means you just have open availability to work whenever they want you to work. You can't do that? Be prepared to hear about it. The expectation is when they call, you run. Life/work balance? What's that? Are you a hard worker? That's great.

Far too much time is wasted looking for and correcting the errors of lower level employees upon which critical work is based. Management is wildly unimpressive, lacking strong leadership abilities and the basic capability to command a staff effectively to accomplish goals and tasks in a timely manner with positive results. Company has a seat-of-the-pants, Wild West style. “Let’s throw this at the wall and see if it sticks” is not an efficient corporate governance strategy. Pay is mediocre, at best. Career advancement appears based on lunchtime and after work socializing prowess rather than hard skills, demonstration of competence and documented accomplishments.

You will get written up if you go over them. Vacation time must be accrued before any request can be made.

There is also opportunity for overtime all of the time. Which is nice if you are ever in need of extra money and you want to do that math you know what you need to do how many hours into work, in order to get the money that you need. I would say the best part about working here is that you really feel like you are working with friends and family. You get a supervisor who has a team, and you have meetings at least once or twice a month. Outside of that there is the opportunity to get sale bonuses each month, but it is not required in a sense of you have to push sales it is nearly an opportunity while having a conversation with a customer. Oh and not to mention, they have their own cafeteria that you get a free meal tickets for whenever you work 30 minute lunches.","If you are used to having your weekends to yourself, then working at PennyMac may not be a good idea for you.

On top of stress and ZERO work/life balance then this is the place for you.","All of the above and to add insult to injury you get paid semi monthly, no PTO you have to Accrue the time so if you have kids or health issues then this is not the company for you.

Major layoffs and way to many hands in the pot. I think there where 200+ VPs and AVPs. Layoffs = promotions for those that remain.

,3.0,"Feb 29, 2016",Penny Pantry is very convenient for lunch (if you work at the Moorpark office) For the most part the people are nice,"Pennymac is the type of company that wants to squeeze the most possible out of employees while giving as little as possible in return. - vacation policy - 2 weeks (3 weeks after five years). pretty pathetic compared to what some companies are offering - holidays - only 8 per year. So if you are accustomed to getting the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas eve off, you'll be spending two of your meager 10 vacation days for that. - health insurance is expensive and not very good - even stingy about bathrooms. Never have I been at a company where on a daily basis I had to go to another bathroom because the one I went to was full - seems gung ho about open seating (I think this is so they can watch you continuously). there seems to be a mistrust of employees, assuming people will not do their jobs if they aren't out in the open. (also reflected in the policy that nobody can work from home because they won't know if you are working). I guess they don't realize they can look at your work output / quality to see if you are doing a good job? - no raises for cost of living. If you are just doing your job and not striving for promotion (some people don't want more money for more responsibility, they are happy at their level), you won't get a raise. Which means as the years go by, you are effectively paid a little less each year. Of course they say that they are working to improve the culture. I seriously don't expect much to change.

In the 2.5 years I was here, I found myself holding different roles and taking on different responsibilities I never thought I'd take on. I have gained skills and knowledge that go far beyond mortgage origination that will serve me well in my career. My relationships with my colleagues have evolved into life long friends. I had cool bosses, who I learned more from than my college professors. Now as far as mortgage origination goes, the biggest perks to me are: Paid training, all licenses paid for, inbound leads that know nothing but PennyMac, pricing exceptions to keep your product competitive, rate lock extension costs are 99% of the time eaten by the company and cool people to work with.","Ideas to help management retain more employees: Communication is not as effective as it could be. Key announcements are distributed via email or Google chat. Simply put, they get lost. Steep learning curve to digest all systems needed to originate. Town halls with the managing director would help build the culture as well as company happy hours. Paper plates, company paid for healthy snacks and some signage on the wall would spruce up the place. Certainly fixing the broken glass window and patching the dry wall.

Don't even get me started on the location too, I live in my car traveling to and from this frontier outpost... Those unfortunate to be hired in the 2008-2011 era can be extremely under-pad, I mean they make maybe 50% of what they should or would make other places.

Simply the BEST,5.0,"May 26, 2021","I began working with PennyMac as a licensed Mortgage Loan Originator in December or 2020; prior to my transition, I had minor reservations due to it essentially being one of the most unique, extraordinary, and pressurized times to make such a career transition… let alone into this high volume industry. However, my reservations were cleared soon enough- PennyMac was incredibly easy to work with during my transition, and provided all of the support and training that was needed and beyond. Transitioning to PennyMac allowed me to obtain 27 state licenses within just one short month of being on-boarded to the company, which easily exceeded my expectations! The company culture, including the kindness and diversity of individuals here, the willingness of the leadership team to jump in to assist, the every-day never ending fresh and viable leads, the excellent online reviews that I may refer my borrowers to, the A+ with the Better Business Bureau, being a publically traded company, the millions of borrowers that are already inherently trusting the company with their mortgages, Benefits, 401K’s, compensation, employees being shown that they are valued and treated as the greatest asset every day, loans NEVER being sold to competitors, costs being competitive, and Pricing Exceptions turning around SO QUICKLY, are just a FEW of the praises I could go on about regarding benefits with PennyMac!! I feel incredibly lucky and valued with this company every day, and it clearly shows to each borrower that I meet. The company is rightfully stringent on compliance and takes the laws incredibly seriously- the objective, moral, logical thing for a federally regulated type of organization. However, in addition: Loan Officers such as myself are rewarded for literally doing our job and maintaining the laws that govern our role, i.e., keeping up with compliance in our conversations borrowers, and our monthly/annual continuing education. The compensation has the ability to be extraordinary; for an extraordinary individual, the sky is the limit. Ultimately, it is both the individuals who are selected to drive the leadership team, and the employees who assist in driving the company to success, that are the highlight of the day to day. Each day is one to feel valued, feeling as though the company is fully supported towards running such as a well-oiled machine. Well done PennyMac…it is beyond easy to recognize why this company is widely regarded as one of the OVERALL BEST mortgage companies around.","Would like a procedure booklet for miscellaneous hard-stops for one particular system, but these typically get sorted out quickly anyhow.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Best call center mortgage lender,4.0,"May 5, 2022","Company is very focused on transparency, following regulations, and doing the right thing. Sometimes (perhaps even often) to a fault. But I'd much rather work for a company too focused on being honest than work for one that doesn't care about it at all. Pay is great and the company is very proactive about shifting pay tiers to current market conditions. Coworkers are great. Most everyone enjoys coming into work and enjoys their job, even in this rising rate environmeout, UNBEATABLE pricing and when we do rarely get beat out, it's very easy to verbally negotiate to win the business. Lots of autonomy and respect for how you run your business. As long as you stay on top of everything and have solid production. You pull credit, price out the file, run AUS, and lock the loan without any required interference from anyone else. Overtime has been cut back on, but it isn't much of an issue. You're required to work one scheduled Saturday a month, and can put in occasional overtime outside of that as long as it's for follow up work. I didn't start my time in the mortgage industry here, but I wouldn't work for any other call center mortgage lender other than PennyMac. I was fortunate enough to not be one of the many who were inevitably laid off these past few months. But that wasn't PM specific. The whole industry is in shambles right now.","No sales training. If you're new to sales you'll either need to learn that stuff through: trial and error, advice from coworkers and managers, sales videos, and books. You are only taught the technical aspects of the mortgage origination software here. No training on how to pitch a loan either. This is a good place to end up at after being with one or two other companies. As I said, overly concerned with compliance to a fault. Lots of unnecessary and trivial tasks to submit a loan. It feels like there's a large disconnect from compliance and the sales department. There's a very very lengthy ""wrap-up script"" you have to read to lock any loan. They are somewhat aware of this annoyance and so they give you a $500 bonus every month as long as you don't get any compliance fails. It often feels like the company would love us to be robots, only capable of reciting the very limited scripts they give us.

Coworkers were awesome and easy to socialize with. Job was challenging enough to keep engagement, while remaining an easy task.","The reason why I would not recommend this job is because there is no ambition to strive for greater. Leadership does not appreciate any collaboration to boost job performance. From my experience, my manager preferred to control and dictate the way in which a person must do their daily job functions. Manager was allowed to force the team to take lunch at a specific time with set times to take a break with no regards to the preferences of the the customers in regards to contacting them in relation to their loans. Also, the hours constantly changed. Management provided that hours would change from training to the official start, but they did not explain that hours would also change after you started the job. If this is the job that you would like to work, be prepared to be treated as a robot that is expected to do exactly as told. Free thinking is not allowed, even if it optimizes your job performance. Be sure to keep tabs on all of your job processes, but do not make it known. Screenshots are a necessity to have, but not need rather than to need and not have. I would also recommend that you get management to provide you either written or recorded affirmations of what you have been told. This is not to say that management is to not be trusted, but it is to say that you want to be well prepared just in case the job starts to become stressful and records start to age into a forgotten zone.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

From Great Team & SM to Finding out the True Company Colors,3.0,"Jul 6, 2022",The *people* in the office truly got along in most cases and supported one another. My sales manager and team specifically were amazing! Great dynamic we personally had; nearby teams essentially followed! Most of the tenure was great with these individuals! Picked mostly wonderful staff. ********************************** The Con is a review of the Finale of most of their employees. I will still provide 3 stars for an average rating. I could’ve been tricked into giving 5 for how great my team was but it would not be fair. The following Con was true in my experience and shows the company colors (tiger stripes) when looked beyond the team pond and out.,"When the industry changed due to this year’s tip in inflation, they demoted every female SM in my branch to LO. Many of the males retained their positions and fewer were demoted. Loyal employees were mislead though to the end with the Ultimate Layoff; almost every single LO terminated. (No prior official warning) In general, a member of senior management verbally assured employees that they were built for such changes via the company structure; throughout the beginning of the year to the very end. They said essentially “we always pivot and succeed.” Pivoted their staff off the roster, and the opposite of being direct, I see. Some leadership even commented on other companies doing such layoffs with distaste. Can you spell h y p o c r i c y? Assuming they surely knew their own plans all along they’d have been best to have prepared their employees to step aside and find new opportunities before other companies in the same industry did just the same. Disrespectful to employees efforts. I had a feeling it was coming months ahead but asking a couple peers privately if they thought it would happen, they said, “no way!” Because of assurances. Then they all became unprepared, unlike me, I left very shortly before The Event. I felt tension, I felt fake, and like I was being lied to not by my SM but by those above about that certain reality, and felt expected to smile, and not ask questions as those leadership pawns talked of assurance and how they’d PIVOT and get better. Thanks PNMAC, loved your staff! Glad to see you valued them immensely and let them down easy! (not..) Last con: this probably won’t matter because of capitalism; they seem to have demonstrated at the end they cared less for those who had supported the company for months or years and their livelihood/quality of life than their bottom dollar. Least they could do it was say it than leave everyone else unprepared in the market. Things likely won’t change next time. But they hurt a lot of people I knew in an already historically bad year with cold regard.

"Extremely happy loan officer, but extremely disappointed by the company in the end.",2.0,"Nov 29, 2022","During COVID the executive team sent very thoughtful gifts out almost monthly to help keep the camaraderie going. It was a nice gesture. Sadly, the rest of the culture is just awful. It’s just another lender ran by “the good old boys” from the now defunct lenders who created the turmoil of the last lending crisis. The pay was decent but could be better. Benefits were fairly priced. Met many great managers and fellow LO’s and Ops members. Tremendous talent there until the mass layoffs. The good talented people got cut, leaving just the good old boys and their BFF’s like it’s high school all over again. Top performers with stellar quarterly and annual reviews IN writing/documented. ALL gone! If you don’t know mortgage they do have decent training program. I came on as a Senior LO so I didn’t need the training but got to see it firsthand and it’s good. Office is very nice. Modern. HQ has a restaurant inside! Very cool facilities. Coffee is good. That is important too for any hard working LO. Get rid of the toxic old school individuals here and you’ve got a company that will last! Many things could be solved by asking the hard working employees who work there. I’d go back in a heartbeat if the flaws were addressed head first. I truly believe in this company.","Low Comp, Leads aren’t consistent. You can’t go from making $200K to $60K due to lead inconsistency. Don’t blame the market because I’m referencing the time before rates went up.

Upper Management is aged out, stuck in their old toxic ways. Too buddy buddy/ high school popularity contest nonsense. Trim the true fat. Them! Stop laying off all the talented folks who have given years of hard work here. Give both the LO and Processors more control over their files. Then you’ll stop the crazy fallout! Listen to your employees from the bottom up. Less micromanagement of preforming employees. It’s counterproductive to many. The company gave up too quick, too easily just to keep stockholders happy. Mass layoffs could’ve been avoided and done more strategically. Stop lying to the media and fess up on layoffs. Soon you will need quality employees again and a lot of those same people who were displaced by the mass layoff will still be looking for a job while you do not have enough individuals to run the business.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place,1.0,"Jun 23, 2015","The company is growing out of control, the amount of work that it's creating for itself means that there will always be insufficient staffing, and therefore you will always be tasked with learning a new skill because no one else will be put into the position that actually handles those tasks.","Where do I start? This company's projections are irrational. They are biting off more than they can chew, stressing out employees and every single department. They are lacking in infrastructure, aside for being understaffed and having the feel of a sweatshop. You get 10 vacation days per year, which you have to accumulate. Also the case with sick time, you accumulate 4 hours per month. Things here are grim on every perspective. starting with lack of parking spots, (translating into having to walk from a different company's parking lot on a different street for 10 minutes until you get to your building), continued with the crowded work environment (which is often so loud you can't actually focus on work) to the poor computing technology that hardly supports the tasks needed to be done on a regular basis. The absolute worst of this company is that management is severely lacking in leadership skills. often managers will not acknowledge their employees or even realize how knowledgeable and experienced they are. Career pathing is formally not on the agenda. nepotism rages out of control. You will most likely not get a raise, ever. I have seen people get promoted 2 or 3 times, without getting a raise, with the title change being delayed up to 3 months, and taking on additional responsibilities while minimizing their personal life outside of work for the sake of being able to function. HR is a joke, they take forever to handle claims, and in some cases they even drop the ball to a point where medical workers comp claims get denied because they don't provide forms in due time. Executives pretty much will not acknowledge your existence even if you interact with them on a daily basis. Unless a manager need something from you, he will not even say hello. Promotions are often based on veterancy and position availability. most of the time because of the high turnover rate - positions will just become available and it will be cheaper for the company to promote somebody from within without giving them a raise, rather than hiring somebody from the outside and to try and match market salaries.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

"AVOID THIS CUTTHROAT, PRIMADONNA PLACE!! – UNLESS YOU ARE DESPERATE FOR A JOB",1.0,"Jun 8, 2016","I enjoyed working with smart, dynamic people and learning new skills. The cafeteria also served decent food at times. The gym is decent given the size of the room.","I would describe the company culture as being TOXIC at best due to WEAK MANAGEMENT. I had the misfortune of working with managers who were very unapproachable (even narcissistic) and only talked to you when they needed something ASAP (not even a “Good Morning”). In addition, there were many managers who were INCOMPETENT and LACKED FUNDAMENTAL SKILLS to do the job as managed with an “IRON FIST”. Many times, they will take credit for your ideas and work to cover up their own shortcomings. I also felt there was a LACK OF TRANSPARENCY working on projects since I was NOT INVITED TO CRITICAL MEETINGS and UNREALISTIC DEADLINES WERE PROMISED to the stakeholder. To make matters worse, I wasted more time having to re-clarify what deliverables are needed as well as being under intense pressure to get things done. In addition to WEAK MANAGEMENT, I would also describe the atmosphere as being a “SECRET SOCIETY” where privileged people (those that have tight connections as a result of nepotism) are allowed to prosper and surpass me (in terms of growth and future opportunities) after I’ve shared all of my valuable knowledge (which took years to develop) with them. Largely, I felt that whatever significant contributions that I have made to the department go unnoticed by upper management unless one of their “privileged” kids had done it (or stolen credit for it). If you decide to join PennyMac, just know that: 1. The commute is horrible and parking is problematic (no work from options allowed). 2. You will be low-balled on salary. 3. Their health benefits are expensive. 4. It will take a very, very long time to accrue any vacation time. 5. You must wait 1 year after start date before you can enroll in 401k program. 6. No work/life balance. 7. No raises or merit increases or promotions unless the CEO approved it (which can take an eternity – this is where it helps to have “tight connections”). 8. Be prepared to be exploited and/or marginalized. 9. Have headphones on to drown out obnoxious, fake laughs. Do not have headphones on when the CEO is in the vicinity (as this is one of his pet peeves). Although I am grateful for the skills that I’ve learned and for the relationships that I’ve developed there, but if I had a do-over, I would have only USED the PennyMac OFFER letter as LEVERAGE (without any intent of ever joining).",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

People were scrambling to find seats. They just didn't want to give you a 'day off.' - Coworkers are generally pretty unimpressive and one-dimensional. - Mediocre health insurance benefits. - You get half of your bonus every 6 months, so if you need to leave between April and October, you're forfeiting half of your bonus. This is done deliberately to make you stay at the company, or maybe it's another indication of PennyMac nickel and diming literally everything. - No company holiday party, but a couple times a year they bring food trucks and you get to wait in long lines to get a bite to eat and a lukewarm beer. - Extremely steep organization with layers upon layers of middle management.

You're a passionate Engineer? Don't work here. Period.,1.0,"Nov 2, 2014",Great cafeteria options (although a little expensive) Great gym and facilities,"If you're a passionate software or infrastructure engineer, just stay away from this place. Not only is there unnecessary process and office politics at every turn, but you have to deal with bully managers and a systemic toxic culture that leaves no room for work/life balance. And as others have mentioned, you will never get a raise at this place, ever. No bonus for you either, while most managers and executives roll into work in their $60k+ cars and have performance incentives in the form of QUARTERLY bonuses. Engineering is seen as nothing more than overhead and a bottom pyramid servicing department (like is the case with most financial services companies). This means they need you to follow orders, and not ask too many questions. Don't expect to have any freedom at all while writing code, or architecting systems either. They might lead you on to thinking you have control, but you have no authority over projects, yet are expected to be responsible for the outcome. Responsibility and authority are inseparable. This dynamic does inevitably lead to failures, that will hang over your head. Still feel like you wanna give this company a try and see for yourself? Well, you'll be looking at legacy code and poorly documented systems all day and working on a ton of dead end projects. Hard work will earn you no credibility whatsoever. You'll spend hours stuck in meetings and managers will then wonder why you're still debugging. You will then be asked to work weekends because ""things just need to get done around here"". If this is what you want day in and day out, then go for it. They're always hiring Engineers because people keep quitting, so you could very well end up getting an offer fairly quick.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Good luck finding employment with PNMAC on your resume,1.0,"Sep 1, 2021","Well, they have a great sales pitch to reel you in, and they give you a draw so you're not starving at first","I could easily write a 90 page novel here that would have so many details the review would not get approved and so I'm forced to keep it as general as possible since Corporate America rules the country these days. God forbid we have transparency... I'll echo what many have said below: 1) Poor systems - yes, your loan application will take anywhere from 1-4+ hours, and don't complain about the systems, all roads lead to: It's your fault 2) Hours - plan on gaining weight, eating microwave food, never seeing the light of day, and putting family time on hold 3) Plan on having any/all ""concerns"" dismissed by the sociopaths in charge. They've sold their souls, and they expect you to do the same. 4) Without going into detail, if you're a highly ethical/empathetic/caring individual, it's not the place for you to work. You'll continually get to deliver bad news to clients for reasons I cannot discuss here. 5) They put the ""Cult"" in ""Culture"" - So anyone that's caught speaking up, will be tracked down and pulled into meetings; So if you want a taste of what employment might be like in China, or other authoritarian dictatorships, PNMAC is a great place to learn what that's like. 6) Fundings - Anytime you think you're going to have that ""great month"" watch as fulfillment/processing and others that you count on simply disappear at key points in the process, leaving your clients calling you asking why the notary didn't show up. 7) Expect contradictory guidance - at one moment you're told to do X, then plan on being pulled into a meeting for doing too much of X. 8) Watch as people are promoted SOLELY for parroting management. It truly is like High School 9) Plan on having your loans purposefully and strategically delayed so that by the time you DO decide you want out, you'll be forced to walk away from many clients you worked hard at covering up all of the shortcomings of the company and keeping them on board with the process, because you wont' get paid and in fact, PNMAC hires ""special"" bean counters to go through your pipeline to try to reduce any/all income before you leave. They love what they do and will send you condescending emails with voice of resentment, as if it's your fault that the company has made poor choices and you're now leaving. 10) Finale' time!!! Good luck finding employement anywhere else in a direct to consumer MLO role. When recruiters see PennyMac on your resume, you'll be passed up, OR if you do actually go through the long list of reasons why you left, they simply will not believe you and label you as ""jaded."" Recruiters have zero clue as to how tragically poor the operation here is, that they will actually believe you're just making it up. My advice to recruiters: Believe the reviews here. The negative reviews are not simply weak willed individuals whom lacked grit, perseverance and willingness to succeed.

Wolves in Sheeps Clothing,1.0,"May 25, 2022",Pay was decent and overtime was offered when 'they' needed us and WE pulled through for 'them'. I did take away more knowledge in a particular area of mortgage from this job.,"I was laid off 5/9/22. The 'WE' I speak of are the numerous 'bodies/numbers' that handled the load when the market was exploding when covid hit and all the bodies before me that gave their best to PennyMac over the years, namely many veterans, including myself, who were there in the trenches when it counted. Upper management has no idea of key employee contributions and stellar records because they don't care to know. I was under a management team that came to the company connected to each other and used our knowledge and ideas making them their own promising help and support to advance in the company when, in the end, they cut us loose once they had what they needed. No efforts by management to communicate with other managers in the company to move key, talented employees into other areas of interest. They say they will do this but never follow through with the support of their statements that they will do all they can to help you succeed. I felt used in the end and taken advantage of, BUT knew in my heart all along the kind of 'clickish' people I was under anyway. I still showed up to my job each day and proved my worth so felt good having helped 'MY clients' in my role with PennyMac on a personal level. I felt sad when I was laid off, BUT also felt a weight of lies and deceipt lifted off my life of which I am the wiser for. You always hear of large companies in this manner. ""It's corporate America, they (the big fishes) are all about revenue never thinking of the LOYAL LITTLE FISHES that are helping them swimming in the trenches, taking care of the customers each day going above and beyond."" From the biggest fishes (upper management) down to lower management, unless you fit their idea of staying a subservient employee ALWAYS, never having a desire to advance your career, you will lose in the end with PennyMac. Save yourself the trouble and STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY! OR, take advantage of learning 1 thing really well expecting once you do, you will be ready to move on to another company cause' this one does not have an interest in paying you your worth in the end. I believe one of the reasons PennyMac is set up the way it is, namely people working only 1 specific area of the loan process is to keep them hungry for more knowledge and leaving them trapped with expertise only in only one skill set as many they hire don't have broad experience in the mortgage industry. They can't have people learning and knowing too much because it's NOT this companies practice to advance people in their careers and PAY THEM MORE MONEY. This is truly a revolving door company where advancement is not based on merit. I saw MANY talented AND CLASSY people leave the company on their own, wise to this practice, before lay offs and even after the first round of layoffs. I happened to be laid off in the second round having top production numbers for 2 and 1/2 years while having the best record of helping loans to close on time, etc.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Great place to work if you’re looking for a “Good ‘Ol Boys Club”!!,1.0,"Sep 30, 2022",Sadly the only two things I can think of are decent benefits and a subsidized cafeteria.,"They do not treat women as equals, and even border on sexual harassment, which seems to be a part of their culture. Right before the pandemic, any managers with employees working under them were pulled into a meeting, not shockingly, most of them were men. When they returned, they gathered around near my desk and joked and laughed at a mandate to hire more women. My manager turned to me, and said, “yeah, I was pretty much told I HAD to hire you because you were female.” Another incident with an MD, reviewing presentation materials with my group. It was stressed that everything needed to be perfect, to which the male MD turned and looked at me (the only female in the room), and said, “well that’s why she’s here. To make things pretty.” I also witnessed my male colleague, hired at the same time as me, get one on one training on a daily basis. I was never afforded the same, and in fact, when I asked questions I was treated like I was stupid and told to figure it out myself. Not only was he given more training, but also more work to do. There would be hours upon hours that I was given little to no work to do, but he would be kept busy…it was so obvious that the manager in charge of our work actually said to me, “I know I’m giving him all the work right now, but he needs to learn how to use Excel.” So…because he was under qualified he gets all the work? Or is it because Im female and they were trying to squeeze me out? It’s truly a wonder they haven’t seen sued.

Disappointing.,1.0,"Dec 28, 2013",Parking is free and there is an on-site cafeteria.,"Unfriendly and unprofessional environment. The middle manager over our department delegated a lot of responsibility to seniors or ""team-leads"". The people in these positions were not only very young and inexperienced but also downright immature and catty. They clearly held their personal friends to more lenient standards than the rest of us and took good care of their friends when doling out various work assignments. There were times when people at adjacent desks would be supposedly working on important projects and I would hear nothing but whispering and giggling (not exaggerating here) or in some cases loud talking and flirting for 10, 15, and 20 minutes at a time as I was working my hardest during a very busy day. I eventually invested in some earbuds. Also, I witnessed cases of well-connected people getting picked for promotions over those who were clearly superior candidates in terms of tenure and performance. I noticed that (shocker) young entry-level people whose parents or family members worked at the company or BoA/CW managed to move out of the trenches and into much better positions with the most incredible speed. The Moorpark location is a long drive from most parts of L.A. It is actually in a business park on the outskirts of town which is even worse because you have to drive 5-10 minutes into town if you want to eat somewhere other than the company cafeteria. It was announced to us that everyone in the company would lose one of their discretionary days but the exact explanation given was that both discretionary days were to be replaced with a single ""religious freedom"" day. Interesting. Around the same time, the company became much more aggressive about hiring many more new workers as temps and also keeping them at temp status for as long as possible. Many temps (I was not a temp) of over 6 months tenure who had proven themselves to be solid employees were still being denied conversion to full employee status (and therefore all benefits). Given what I know and what I've heard about the history of Countrywide and Kurland's involvement in it, I probably should have come in with lower expectations.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

Crazy Metrics High turn over,1.0,"May 11, 2021",Cool colleagues. Clean bathrooms. Good training.,"One of the highest turnovers in the industry. I think their goal is to have a high turnover so you work yourself to death trying to meet their metrics only to get fired or resign and walk away from your pipeline so they don't have to pay you. Terrible upper management who puts pressure on lower management and in turn all others suffer. Unattainable metrics (everyone has had a write-up at some point at this company). As your call #'s go up, your call-to-app will go down because it's impossible to do an application on people who were transferred to you who have no intention of refinancing. As your call-to-app goes down, you will receive a write-up. If you increase the number of applications you take to increase those numbers (doing applications on people who you know the loan won't close), your call to app will go up but your app to funding will go down. Micromanaged to death. No work-life balance. I have a friend who still works there. He is in the top 15 Loan Officers by funding and currently has a write-up. He has to hear his manager complain on a daily basis about his call volume. Nothing anyone does is good enough at this company. They care more about metrics than the bottom line. This goes to show, even if your end goal is to close many loans, you still aren't good enough. Their goal is to get you to meet their metrics, not close loans. While I was there (one of the only females), I had a perverted manager who always stood really close and when I was sitting down he'd lunge his crotch in my face when my head was at his waist level.",PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust,PMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PENNYMAC-Reviews-E230027.htm

There's no work from home policies, and everyone in the office is extremely toxic.

"Should have taken these other reviews as warning. Single parents, listen up.",1.0,"Jun 1, 2023","The wonderful history within the Ryman and the Grand Ole Opry. Saying that you work for either of them always garners impressive comments from others. But that don't pay the bills. Pay is okay, but not for the amount of unneeded stress you'll endure.","HR department is terrified of communicating with anyone who's not ""top-floor"". Highly tout ""hybrid, flexible workplace"" when interviewing, but please don't be fooled. You'll get one day WFH/week at best, and they make you feel bad about it. The corporate office is more cliquey and catty than a teen movie. The amount of bickering that goes on between leadership roles over the dumbest projects and deadlines is laughable. If they'd spend half of the energy expended on that (or the inane team-building exercises you're forced to endure) lord knows what kind of heights this company would be taken to... And it's not like the company is doing terribly - they're rich as balls and like to tell you about it, as if it's also in your bank account as well. ""Hey everybody, come see how good I look!"" As I said, single parents - listen up. I'm a single father of 2 very young children, and from the day that I was hired, I was up-front in communicating that I needed to make full use of their so-called flex-time and remote policies, as there are times where I have no control over what time I need to leave the office in order to pick up my kids on-time. I was CONSTANTLY bullied by my direct supervisor over this, requesting that I submit my arrival/departure schedule to her WEEKLY for approval, though it never changed. Well, that wasn't going to happen. I was terminated because of this, and it's wrong on so many levels. Mental health is not a concern for leadership or HR. If you disclose you have a problem and need help, they will single you out. Also, get ready for all of the most cliché meme-worthy moments possible in a corporate setting. Pizza parties to celebrate record earnings in Q1! Teambuilding exercises at an escape room. All the gaslighting you can take. Take heed and go elsewhere. This place doesn't have the legacy of any of these historic brands they manage in mind, just how much they can earn. I get it, we're all in business for money, but take care of your people. Lastly - Diversity & Inclusion is touted as a top priority in this organization, but it's laughable. It all comes down to making sure there's a token person of color in all marketing materials, that's about it.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

I spent many hours explaining to VP level employees how marketing within the concert industry works, which as a professional who would still like to learn, was defeating. The workload assigned and expected from corporate marketing is unmanageable, and when you do express being overwhelmed you'll be told to suck it up. Don't let the shiny factor of the experiences distract you from very toxic culture present. It is not worth it. If you try to defend yourself, you'll be told you're not a ""team player.""

The Peter Principle At Work,2.0,"Feb 7, 2019","The company has some great benefits for full-time team members (health, dental, + vision with a very reasonable employee contribution, a 401k with a 4% match vested immediately) and they rely very heavily on their long-standing reputation as meccas within the entertainment industry. They talk all the time about how cool it is to work there because of the Ryman Auditorium and the Grand Ole Opry, and depending on your role, you will get to interface with some great music business connections, as well as go to some fun destinations along with the hotel properties they own and new Ole Red restaurant chain. If you work in the corporate building, you have access to some perks such as $4 lunch in the cafeteria on Tuesdays and Thursdays, a gym, Crossfit and Yoga classes, and if you are at a certain level within the company, you can request tickets in the suite at Bridgestone Arena for concerts, events, and Predators games.","The company has an internal identity that is completely at odds with the actual working experience. HR and C-Suite level team members talk all the time about the great culture and how cool it is to work there, but the culture is very condescending, mainly held as a standard for front line and hourly employees while salaried and senior leaders are not held equally accountable and are not well versed in the culture themselves. The culture on paper looks good at first glance, but upon a little closer observation, you realize it's just leftovers from the days when the company operated the hotel, and most leaders couldn't tell you the Vision Statement if their life depended on it, let alone the other components of the aspirational, cartoony fluff being passed off as core to the company's values. Speaking of Salaried and Hourly Employees... the pay is good if you are an exempt team member, but if you are hourly you have to fight for every cent you have. There is no consistent policy for team outings (birthday lunches- am I expected to participate as a volunteer or stay on the clock?), and in general the pay is less than what you can make elsewhere in Nashville. There are lots of leaders that are holdovers from the Gaylord days, and many of them have risen to a level in the organization that is completely beyond their capabilities and skillsets. As a result, many of these mid- to high level leaders work constantly (several of my leaders have sent me emails at 3am and no, they aren't working the entertainment shows on these nights) in order to try to outpace their inadequacy and inability to delegate properly. There is a culture that you have to give everything to work, which would be one thing if people worked well together. On the contrary, the organization is extremely disconnected, with each team operating as its own silo, and communication is abysmal, with lots of duplicate work because the culture does not encourage sharing of resources and knowledge. There is no regular feedback process for team members to go through to voice concerns and frustrations other than going directly to HR, who rarely make an effort to correct the situation. The only real time an employee can voluntarily voice feedback is when leaving the company, and then the HR team discounts the perspectives as disgruntled employees. When feedback is done, it is in the form of handpicking team members to talk to the CEO so that he gets a very sanitized view of the perception within the organization. Voluntary development tools are also lacking; leaders are expected to attend mandatory training periodically, but there is no accountability if a leader decides not to participate. They only offer tuition reimbursement on college degree programs, so if you want to get a certificate or other training that would positively impact your abilities in your role, it is dependent on if your leader is willing to part with a few dollars from their budget (precious few leaders see the value in this). Most disturbing is the fact that all the C-suite leaders have surrounded themselves with yes men. Anytime an executive changes direction or priority, the whole team is expected to jump up and immediately get to work on the passion project du jour. The leaders can get ugly and aggressive in meetings and lash out at team members, but there is no culture of open dialogue and feedback, so rather than having a heated but open conversation on the goals and direction of strategy, mid-level leaders kowtow to this behavior, come back to their teams, and have truly unreasonable expectations for the team members to then meet these new deadlines and project achievements. There is no solid priority set for the future, so the minute a C-suite leader makes an offhanded comment about one area, everyone jumps to make a difference in that business area (think of rats skittering from side to side on a ship). This means that when new leadership is brought in, the selection process is very short sited or expectations are grandiose (we've had 3 new CMOs in 2 years, and multiple people are starting to count on 2 hands the number of bosses they've reported to in the same time period). Some leaders overstep their bounds to assert their dominance on areas of the business they shouldn't be involved in; meanwhile, other leaders don't hold their team accountable.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

It happened multiple times during my years with the company. Often times, the restructures were not well thought out and caused more issues than anything, which eventually lead to more restructuring. Depending on the position, there isn't a great work-life balance. Corporate is very political. The Opry will always be the ""golden child"". As a whole, the company will talk about all the growth potential, but realistically, the opportunities for promotions are few and far between. Corporate has a condescending attitude and those in management positions will lie and take credit for your work in order to protect themselves.

Dream Job Turned Nightmare,1.0,"Mar 15, 2019","Decent health benefits, 401 k (match up to 4%), PTO accrual, options to attend shows that are not selling well.","I do not recommend this place to anyone. In fact, at this point I feel major guilt when we interview/hire amazing candidates because I know their talents are going to be wasted coming in here. RHP claims to want to be hiring ""experts in their fields"" but really they only want yes-men that will jump when C-Suite (or the select few individuals that hold tremendous amounts of power) says “jump”. Between constantly sticking up for your work (your manager/director will not) through a spider web of red-tape and approvals, and the horrendous work-life balance you will quickly burn-out. But that's okay! There are members of C-Suite that have been on record saying they want younger employees that they can pay less and work harder. Unfortunately, that's probably why we are sitting at a 50%+ turnover rate. Many members of my team (and I know to be true of other departments in the organization) have attempted to go to their leaders and tell them that things are not working, and we need to come together and find ways to fix things or we are going to see a lot of people leave. These conversations are all met the same way with harsh defenses and ""your feelings are incorrect"". Feedback given to the HR team is swept under the rug. Everyone just wants C-Suite to think everything is okay. It's not okay. The ship is sinking.

Occasionally, we have a farmers market that showcases local produce and vendors.","This company suffers from poor leadership from the top down. The CEO surrounds himself with ""yes men"" who reinforce his outlook and priorities. At one point, one of our weaker business ventures had been poorly performing for months and the CEO became aware of this last, mostly due to no one telling him about the failure. Other C-suites remain out of touch regarding day to day tasks and responsibilities of their team but remain mercurial. When they do decide to jump in and work with the team, they cause more confusion in their effort to catch up on the business. When it becomes apparent that the leadership is out of the loop, has not read emails, etc, they become defensive or act out. Poor leadership at this company has created a company culture where employees (who are trained adults and experts in their fields) have zero autonomy or authority in their work --- everything is second guessed after the fact and minute details that don't jive with the absent c-suites are deemed as ""big misses"" and projects grind to a screeching halt over elements that are not business impacting or revenue driving. This company does not reinvest in their employees encouraging additional training, certificates, conferences, etc. Many employees at Managerial levels have simply stayed with the company for a decade (sometimes starting on the Hotel side) and have been systematically promoted/rewarded regardless of their competence or skill set that best suits the role. Perhaps most alarming, feedback given to HR is met with blank stares as if a robot received a programming error. Recently, the company decided to offer vacation accrual (because prior, no vacation was offered for an employee's first year). HR presented this change like some grand innovation when really, this is the bare minimum offered by companies country-wide. It's like someone getting the iPhone 3 and being really impressed with the new technology and having no clue that they're 7 generations behind. Another contradiction, the company maintains that they are the leader in entertainment and want to remain competitive in the space. Everyone I have spoken to at this company has admitted they took a significant pay cut to work for RHP. This is concerning considering the CEO gets a significant bonus (rumored to be in the millions) every year.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm
Be Careful!,1.0,"Sep 11, 2018","- The people, all of the employees not beholden to the corporate structure are incredible people. - The benefits. If you happen to find a way into one of the minimally available full time positions the benefits are fantastic.","You know how people joke about evil corporations? Ryman HP may just be the example to take a look at. They have a stranglehold on the hospitality industry in the Nashville area so wages are stagnant. They tend to lead their most hopeful employees on with a carrot on a stick when it comes to moving up-- they talk up their ""growth potential"", but there aren't the positions available anywhere within. How is it that a company so proud to reach the coveted title of ""Billion dollar company"" has so many elderly employees working for 8.25/hr, some of which have worked there for 47 years, that have never received a raise? They keep their non-corporate management in the dark which leads to confusion throughout all of the departments. Communication in general between departments is lacking. The non-corporate management dictated by the uncaring, unseen, arcane corporate side neglects being direct in instruction in order to perpetuate the faux family atmosphere of the staff. The staff themselves live up to these standards of family, but the management continually makes new and confusing policies that do the exact opposite. Company propaganda has recently been pushed through that at the very least asks the employees to memorize and recite the company motto, and they go as far as to ask employees to attend wellness fairs with health screenings-- that basically hands over their personal information to the company to use how they see fit. Pay is horrendous. Even after a small raise I was still well under the reasonable living wage in my area. The management above me was not fairing much better as well as the management above them. No one there is satisfied with what they are paid. Where is the money going? Meanwhile the CEO, gave himself a bonus in the higher end of six figures while his lowest level employees are working for poverty wages. There are more than one employees who are sexually harassing other employees, as well as guests, who have yet to be reprimanded or let go. One employee, who was gender non-conforming, only discussing it through their personal social media , was even shamed into leaving the company by other employees without anyone in management addressing the bullying. This was not an isolated incident. Don't be fooled by the faux positivity and friendly atmosphere, the closer you look the more sour it will become.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

Difficult times at a REIT,2.0,"Mar 5, 2014","Some nice properties in the portfolio, Managerial bonuses were good. More recently the company has focused on shedding assets to manage a smaller portfolio of properties.","I worked for a property the REIT owned/managed, and while SOX compliance kept an invisible wall between the operator (at the time, Sunstone Hotel Properties) and the REIT (Sunstone Hotel Investors), there was a clear attitude that the value of the property the asset was on was paramount to employee or guest satisfaction. It was a very difficult time to be in hotels and SHI didn't fare any better--surrendering keys to its more heavily financed properties, and dissolving the management company to reduce employee headcount. (It was particularly tactless when flash-animated cards were sent to all associates with the names of their colleagues at the headquarters office who were let go due to staffing reductions--the entire office's closure was heralded by two of these e-cards). While I likely felt more direct effects of decisions implemented by the managers of the operator, there was a clear message that the values and pressure were applied by SHI, and the operator was merely the tool to implement the vision they had.","Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.",SHO,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sunstone-Hotel-Investors-Reviews-E4448.htm

PTO and benefits pretty generous, I was fortunate to receive great bonuses and some raises over the course of my two years there. Met some amazing people","Senior management thinks they're above everyone else. Advancement is few and far between. You can fulfill the role of the missing puzzle piece in property management and get told you're not good enough to get a promotion even though they tell you, you're doing a great job at your annual reviews. You can be doing all the spreadsheets, tenant engagement, and a ton of stuff that is not in your job description--however, the reason you can't be promoted is because you occasionally forget a comma or don't write the actual day of the week in an incident report. Nothing you do will be considered unless you out your coworkers and put on a front that you're good at your job. But, the people who have been there for significantly less time than you and who are the most complained about amongst the company regarding work ethic will get promotions. The company claims to care about opportunities for women and for people of color but at the end of the day, they don't really care it's all a front. There are no POC in property management (I say this as white indivual). If you're not blond haired and blue eyed or in a sorority or fraternity, it's very rare that you get put in the position of a client facing role. The company only cares about making money and looking good (this is valid). But, they do not care about how the mental health of their workers is affected. Someone close to you passes way? I'm so sorry but there's no bereavement period--not even one day.

Information Technologies - Technical Analyst Role,1.0,"Oct 4, 2017",There's a few really talented members of the team that were great mentors.,"If you're looking at this role, be aware that this role is no where near as technical as it's made out to be in the interview. Work/Life Balance - Basically non existent. You're expected to be on call 24/7, be regularly updating tickets on nights and weekends, as well as being available for overtime everyday. While the expectation of any IT job is to be ready to put in extra hours, the expectation here leaves no time for any sort of balance. Every team meeting, the VP stated that the team needs to clear any upcoming plans outside of business hours, in order to be on stand by or to be on site. This became a regular demand, not a request. On top of this, vacation requests were routinely denied, with reasons cited that go against the company time off policy. It is frowned upon if you're not basically living from your desk. Leadership - The leadership of the Information Technologies is non-existent. There are some serious communication issues that are not being addressed, and in the span of 1 1/2 years, 4 members of the Information Technologies team have chosen to resign. There is a clear lack of management experience in this department. There is no room for professional growth and there is no room for promotions within this department.",SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm

Be Wary,2.0,"May 6, 2018","Reputable public company within the industry, wide opportunity to see many things, central Midtown location.","- Extreme lack of communication from management and between departments. Expectations and goals are not clear or concise. Processes are scrambled across departments leaving the staff to put the puzzle back together, which leads to - Poor company culture. The mentality is always; I need this done now or why isn't this already done? with no forewarning or set expectation. Not a great culture to learn. This leads to - Poor morale and high turnover. The long hours and lack of communication have caused some departments to lose over half the staff in less than a year. Pushes work to the few who remain. - The above is fine if properly compensated or evaluated. But the company stresses their ""lean"" operations, which is simply a crutch to underpay or fire employees as a cost control tactic. - The below comments on sexism or favoritism is not shocking based on the environment.",SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm

Your work hours will be expected to match those of the investment teams on both coasts (9-9 is standard in calm periods, few of which existed when I left). They will continue to hire team members in NYC for double your salary who often work half the hours. HR preaches diversity while only hiring minorities into coordinator or EA roles that have no growth opportunities. Management makes it very clear back office should be grateful to be allowed in their presence, the FW office is the ugly stepchild. The toxic culture is palpable, everyone has seemed more and more miserable over the last few years and the response has been additional layoffs. This is all in addition to the standard woes of PE that are alive and well at TPG; the “boys club” culture, rampant elitism, forget work life balance you will not have a life, etc. They seem to believe if they use Goldman as a direct funnel for new hires they won’t realize they’re being overworked and have managed to build an even worse working environment with worse work life balance.","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

Disappointing Culture for Women – Disrespect and Double Standards,1.0,"Jun 20, 2025",Catered lunch and paid parking,"Very low pay, old office space. During my short time at the company, I witnessed and experienced a deeply concerning dynamic, particularly for women. There’s a clear expectation that women remain agreeable and accommodating at all times—even in the face of disrespect or inappropriate treatment. Speaking up is often met with defensiveness or dismissal, rather than support or accountability. There are no clear expectations made my mid level managers It felt like being seen less as a professional and more as someone expected to “keep the peace,” no matter the cost. Women who advocate for themselves or set boundaries are labeled as “difficult,” while those who stay silent are taken advantage of. It creates a toxic double standard where abuse is tolerated if it’s coming from the top down—and women are expected to absorb it without protest.","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

Excellent fully paid benefits. Job duties are clearly defined and pretty straightforward.","Don't expect any variety in your day-to-day tasks. I supposed some departments may have more variety than others, but generally speaking, the EA role at TPG is limited to booking travel, scheduling calls/mtgs, and preparing expense reports. It's good place to be if you don't need to be challenged and don't mind feeling like you're in a rut after just 2 weeks. Most Admins can expect to help out at the front desk answering phones and greeting guests when the receptionist needs to take breaks. This can be disruptive to your day when you're trying to get things done but keep getting called up to reception for bathroom breaks. As far as upward mobility goes, there isn't much.

TPG Fort Worth is where dreams come to die,2.0,"Mar 28, 2021","-Everyone is interested in doing what’s right for investors -Great business- TPG is always ahead of the curve and thinking outside of the box -TPG hires great people. Just about everyone is intelligent and competent, and nice to work with -Senior management is out of San Francisco and holds high standards in terms of diversity and inclusion, which is heavily supported by FW management. The company is especially supportive of LGBT employees -The support employees give to charitable initiatives is truly heartwarming. There are some ongoing charities the firm supports, and employees go above and beyond to support these causes. For example- care packages for the troops, fundraising for the cystic fibrosis foundation, and a clothing drive for an LGBT teen homeless shelter showed everyone jumping in with their donations and their time -All the free food you can dream of (pre-pandemic) -Company is taking the pandemic seriously - everyone is working from home","-Massive divide between the “front office” (SF) and “back office” (FW). From the perspective of SF, back office is nothing and the only interaction between the two offices is through a few very senior individuals. There’s no understanding or appreciation of all the work that goes on in FW to support front office. -Crazy amounts of turnover. Considering that TPG has a great business, a respected name, pays well for the market, and hires the best, this shouldn’t be. -Crushingly hierarchical. Strong attitude by management that everyone should “stay in their place” and that only the most senior should have their voices heard. And even then, even the most senior often have no control over their careers. Job functions will change on the whims of management, even if it doesn’t make sense. Some of it has to do with the high amount of turnover, but uprooting the entire way the system works isn’t the way to plug a hole -While there are so many smart and competent people around, it’s more likely that an incompetent person who knows how to throw around business buzzwords and play the politics game will get promoted -I’ve never seen so many great people so beaten down by a place – management has no regards at all for the interests, background, or skill sets of employees. It doesn’t matter what you are hired to do- the job you were hired into can change out from under you out of nowhere, or you could be plucked out of your job at any moment and thrown into a new role you have no interest or experience in. Don’t get too comfortable with the manager who hired you- that’s very likely to change multiple times -Nothing ever improves- people are rarely left in a role long enough to become proficient and begin to improve the process and make things more efficient. Constant thrown-in learning mode. If someone doesn’t feel like doing something, they can just ignore it until everyone’s job changes again and it’s someone else’s problem. Manual processes galore thanks to expensive new systems put in that are only 90% of the way integrated -No training. Sink or swim mentality -Culture of fear. When something goes wrong (and it will) and it makes the “back office” look bad, management is very quick to point a finger at someone and fire them. Because of this blame culture, people are hesitant to take ownership of things. Because nobody takes ownership and jobs change so often, there’s a lot left up in that air that doesn’t end up getting done","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

At all. Very hierarchical. Administrative staff at the very bottom of the chain and indirectly, made to feel that way. Perks abound at all levels but not if you are an admin (firm conferences, new hire dinners, team building retreats...not if you are an admin). Huge dichotomy between investment teams and administrative professionals. Very little (almost zero) training. A few sessions are offered here and there for new technologies, but don't expect any new hire training as an admin. You'll receive an administrative handbook, desk, computer and access to all the supplies you need, but there is no ramp up and no formal new hire training for administrative staff. None. As a result, people are left to sink or swim and sadly, some good people leave b/c they weren't afforded the resources or time to find their feet. High turnover. Mostly admins seem to be fed up or find something more interesting, in light of all the benefits and pay. Senior management doesn't seem to know anything about what the administrative staff experiences and they don't inquire about it either. Some tenured administrative assistants have moved up the chain in to interesting roles, but that is few and far between.

It's a dynamic work environment and not a place where you'll be bored to tears. There are some great people here, but also some atrocious personalities.","Where to begin... it can be extremely political. It's not who you hitch your wagon to, but who they hitch your wagon to. You will watch people continue to get promoted not necessarily for their skills/knowledge, but because they are visible and have a director who fights for them. Other directors and senior managers will deliberately hold people back from progressing in their careers. Some junior to early management level staff go above and beyond and the response from upper management is ""that's what is expected"" while others just do their job and are deemed to be promotable. They'll also promote you if they think you're going to quit, so people have successfully played that card (something to consider). There is no sense of development of skills and knowledge. No true and comprehensive training. They want people to stay in the position they are in because it's too difficult to replace them. They will say that the firm promotes and encourages lateral movement between teams, but that is seldom the case, and they will likely pay recruiters heaps of money to hire externally before ever considering someone internally. Many of the senior managers and managers are not true ""managers"" or leaders; they are subject matter experts on their funds, and have little ability to grow, develop, and teach the people reporting to them. The culture is very poor under a thinly veiled attempt at fun and friendly. Be very ready to be thrown under the bus by your Manager/Sr. Manager if something goes wrong, and for them to withhold promotion because of it.

The international team has a great leader- Amrit, who’s an absolute delight to work for.","It’s a contract job at best. Hiring and firing is rampant, which gives you zero job security. Don’t expect any kind of horizontal or vertical growth within the company. You’ll be in the same role, doing the same thing. Involvement and centralised decision making from US can be a source of stress and inconvenient timings for anyone working in Europe or Asia. There is a dire need for HR practices in place. You will have no public holidays and leave requests are a battle to fight. The suggested model of dials to conversion places a massive focus on quantity over quality. There seems to be extreme scrutiny in place. Secret monitoring etc. It creates an environment of lack of trust. Not a great foundation for a remote company. The business model almost encourages you to treat this job as a stop gap.

"Dishonest Leadership, Toxic Culture – Beware",1.0,"Aug 13, 2025",Free brunches at the end of the month.,"This company has a serious transparency problem — both internally and externally. Many honest, critical reviews on this site have mysteriously disappeared over time, which is why you’re likely not seeing the full picture. If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance this review will also be deleted, just like the others that dared to speak the truth. The work culture at WhiteStone REIT is toxic, fear-driven, and unsustainable. The constant pressure, hostility, and lack of support took a real toll on my health — so much so that I ended up in the hospital for 10 days. No job should ever push an employee to that point, yet leadership here shows no concern for employee well-being. The Chief People Officer in particular operates with alarming dishonesty. After my departure, she attempted to twist facts and submit misleading information to block my unemployment benefits. Thankfully, the truth came out and I was awarded benefits, but no one should have to go through such a vindictive process after already enduring a damaging workplace. The company’s downward spiral is not just internal. Their stock has been in sharp decline since the beginning of the year, reflecting the poor decisions and lack of effective leadership at the top. High turnover, low morale, and retaliation against those who speak up are the norm. If you value your health, career, and integrity, avoid WhiteStone REIT. The truth is hidden behind carefully curated PR and removed reviews — but the problems are very real.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Poor Culture and Lack of Support,1.0,"Sep 7, 2025",Some of the benefits are decent.,"My experience at Whitestone REIT was unfortunately very negative. The work environment felt disorganized and unsupportive, and communication from leadership was often unclear.

The culture leaned more toward stress and frustration than collaboration, and opportunities for growth were limited. While the company may be a fit for some, in my opinion there are healthier and more supportive workplaces out there.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,2025-11-12,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Great Outlook,5.0,"Jun 22, 2023","CSuite genuinely cares about their employees. They go above and beyond to try to accommodate everyone, no matter the title or rank. Bad reviews prior to the CEO change in 2022 may have some validity. Post leadership change, they are from bad apples that have benefited for too long doing below the bare minimum. Those that continue to criticize the COO or the company in general, need to take a step back and realize that accountability fosters professionalism and more efficiency. The problem isn’t the COO or Whitestone, it’s you. Instead of taking everything personally and retaliating with petty reviews, look at ways of improving your skills and work ethic and lessen your ego. I have found a work family here and look forward to coming to the office. Never have felt this way about a job before.",There’s a few bad apples left that management still sees potential in.

"Toxic, Manipulative Management",1.0,"Feb 19, 2024",Hotel discounts Occasional free lunches,"Management is not receptive to new ideas, nor do they respect boundaries. I requested we discontinue using a group texting chat (on personal phones) for communication between approximately twenty-five staff members and instead use Teams, a software already used by the team. This would streamline communication and allow for boundaries around personal time. Management dismissed this idea. After leaving the company, I was still receiving texts from that group chat. Management does not listen to or respect support staff. Parent company received violent threats against their newspaper company, which was in the suite next door. I told my boss, I was not comfortable working from the office & I would like to finish the day from home. She said I was the only one who felt that way, and declined my request. Days later, the CEO hired armed security to protect his family and office, and we all worked from home for the following weeks until the threat was dissolved. The way she treated me with such manipulation and dismissal has stuck with me nearly 1.5 years later. Senior staff members were consistently late to meetings with support staff and frequently did not show up at all. The office was a very loud environment with senior staff speaking loudly around the cubicle area, filled with support staff. My work was disturbed and needlessly interrupted multiple times a day. There was even a day the SVPs were loudly cheering on the World Cup game, merely feet away from my cubicle. I requested a hybrid schedule to partially remove the office interruptions for my productivity, and it took 2 weeks to receive any feedback, and then declined altogether. After leaving the company, I learned my replacement was fully remote.
