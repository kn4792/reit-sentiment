Lots of entitlement and charm; very little accountability and integrity,2.0,"Aug 27, 2014","Host Hotels & Resorts offers excellent salary packages and benefits. Their headquarters in Bethesda is centrally-located in the DC Metro area with adequate access to public transportation, restaurants and shopping.","Host Hotels & Resorts is all fluff and no substance. Top management lacks strong leadership skills. There is no accountability nor is honesty and integrity valued. Everything is centered on the bottom line and sealing the deal, regardless of associate sacrifices or complaints.","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Host-Hotels-and-Resorts-Reviews-E305.htm
Host Hotes Values Its Associates,5.0,"Oct 6, 2008","Host Hotels & Resorts is the best job I've ever had in my nearly 20 years in the workforce. They have benefits above and beyond anything I've seen before, including excellent health benefits, hotel discounts, a wonderful 401K program with matching funds, and a stock purchase program, which allows employees to buy stock at a discounted price. The camaderie at Host is amazing. Senior management treats everyone as equal and valuable. I always feel valued. Host also makes the workplace fun with regular gatherings, called Connections, to allow associates in different departments a chance to interact and network. Host is all about respecting and valuing the employees/associates. I never felt so valued as an employee before.",I really can't think of any.,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Host-Hotels-and-Resorts-Reviews-E305.htm
Great benefits.... terrible management!,2.0,"Oct 19, 2017",Excellent health and hotel benefits. Some of the jobs can be pretty interesting too. Company looks good on a resume.,"Similar to other reviews, no transparency or growth. Only way to go up is if you're part of the good ol' boys club, and HR clearly knows this. Departments don't talk to each other and end up doing repetitive work. There are very few managers that I would consider that are good at managing people, that would give credit to their employees and support their growth. Zero transparency from management and leadership on long term plans.","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Host-Hotels-and-Resorts-Reviews-E305.htm

"Great Company, Management in my department wasn't that great",2.0,"Aug 10, 2012",You do get to meet and work with some great and demanding people. Clean upscale work environment. Easy access to the company from the entire DC region. Mr. Marriott is very easy going and had some great Christmas parties. Plenty of work and not sitting around wondering where is the work.,"Pay was very small especially for this area and amount of work I did for them. I started working here after several years out of work due to the recession. I knew not to take this position because I didn't like the manager during the interview, but was desperate for a job and pushed into it by family members. The employees and manager had also told me about all the prior people working at this position that never stayed or were fired. Since my dismissal, they have gone through numerous employees and still cannot find someone ideal to work with them. I had to deal with a manager that blamed all of her problems on her employees when she was the one creating the problems, was constantly in to work late and left early and only worked 3 or 4 days at the company a week. I look back and realize some of the things she did not do or had created problems with is actually quite funny, I realize how much better off I am now that I don't have to deal with her anymore. Many, many times I was left to do a certain amount of work that was meant for 3 people. One small complaint from an employee about me being late for their appointment or anything else turned big with my manager even though I may have still been working with a VP or CEO on an issue and keeping from making it to the other problem. Department Christmas party was extremely embarrassing, management literally got drunk and was singing and such in a very well known restaurant while a few of us were sitting there wondering how much more time do we need to be there.","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Host-Hotels-and-Resorts-Reviews-E305.htm
