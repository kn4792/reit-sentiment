"Great Work Culture, Sour End",3.0,"Jul 11, 2024","- I worked within a great department. The marketing team and our supervisors (Katie, Susan, and Nicole) provided great support annd encouragement to our department. Even during challenging times, especially during budget buts and company-wide layoffs, it felt like we were able to communicate any struggles with our supervisors and were met with the appropriate support. - The benefits and company culture made the corporate employees feel appreciated. While the workload could be rigorous during certain seasons of peak projects, the effort didn’t go unnoticed.","- Unfortunately, Veris and HR specifically has a lot of growing to do when it comes to handling situations involving ADA/disabilities. My accommodations request was treated with a lot of disrespect and unethical practice. After medical leave and what turned into a contentious battle with HR, I was unable to return to work. - There was a lot of tension between certain departments while others worked very closely. It almost felt clique-y depending on which department you were a part of/worked with. - There was an obvious disconnect between the corporate teams and on-site teams. The company would do well to bring both worlds together for a more collaborative environment.","Veris Residential, Inc.",VRE,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Veris-Residential-Reviews-E6510052.htm

Management is poor,1.0,"Apr 24, 2024",Great benefits and supportive team,Communication with management is extremely poor!

Toxic Culture,1.0,"May 1, 2023","Very few. Some of the property accountants are nice. Though, most of the company is very clicky.",Incredibly toxic culture. The people at the company are very self centered. They are not open to coaching and will lie to throw you under the bus.

Gaslighting Leadership,1.0,"Aug 31, 2022","All I can say is that I tried my best while at the company, even when it was Mack-Cali. The new leadership change gave me hope, which is why I've stayed.","Since the new leadership rolled in under Mahbod Nia's watch, it's been constant gaslighting. Broken promises of promotions that are instead given to incompetent friends of new managers. It has created a toxic workplace environment, not conducive to career or personal growth. The green washing (sustainability everything!), philanthropy and culture-pushing is all for optics. They push diversity and hire people of color on their low level/on-site teams. Maintenance or administrative. Take a look at the leadership page to see the company's true reflection.","Veris Residential, Inc.",VRE,Residential,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Veris-Residential-Reviews-E6510052.htm
