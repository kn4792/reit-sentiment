Meaningful Work That Makes a Difference,5.0,"Mar 27, 2025","Working at Howard Hughes is rewarding because the company is deeply committed to making a positive impact in the communities it develops. There’s a strong emphasis on thoughtful, sustainable growth and giving back through philanthropic efforts, which makes the work feel purposeful. It’s inspiring to be part of projects that don’t just build properties but create lasting value for residents and businesses. The company takes stewardship seriously, investing in green space, cultural initiatives, and community programs. If you want to be part of a team that prioritizes impact over just development, this is a great place to be.","While the work itself is meaningful, there’s room for improvement when it comes to leadership and internal communication. At times, the company’s specific business objectives can feel unclear, and more transparency from leadership would help employees feel more aligned with long-term goals. Strengthening internal communications could also help reinforce the company culture, ensuring that employees across all teams feel connected and engaged in the bigger picture.",Howard Hughes Holdings Inc.,HHH,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Howard-Hughes-Communities-Reviews-E723909.htm

Terrible and disappointing experience,1.0,"Aug 18, 2025",Beautiful office space and free lunch.,"Executive level leadership over the team I worked on was oblivious, This particular leader of my team was demanding and flat out rude and had zero leadership skills. They talk about their BRICK values with R standing for RESPECT. Yet, this particular person only had respect for herself using foul language and bully tactics. Had a lot to say but not a clue on how to run a successful and thriving team. C-Suite doesn't seem to care and just enables the behavior. There is a deep dysfunction in the workplace. I am impressed at how well they do financially when the actual work environment l worked in was extremely toxic. Most people are unhappy. A lot of broken promises and you will be over worked and underpaid. Don't bother giving feedback because the powers that be think they know everything even though their department is a revolving door and continues to crumble. A LOT of gossiping in HR amongst one another - no confidentiality. The list goes on and on.

Toxic with High Turnover - Stay Away,1.0,"Sep 27, 2014","Attractive Galleria location. Frequent ""Ordering-In"" of dinner (explained below), and jean fridays.","Extremely high turnover in the Accounting / Finance area (especially Corporate office). No work life balance. Unfortunately, accomplishment is measured on how many hours you put in (not the actual work performed). Dinner is ordered in just about every night and it's a big deal if you leave before 7pm (this is considered early). Employee morale is as low as I've witnessed at any organization of this size. Most people who are still hanging around are just waiting for their share grants to vest before they bolt. The joke of the place is that it's akin to Shawshank Prison (yes the movie). Existing employees actually joke when they see new hires join the team as they take bets on how many weeks the new person will last. **Last note - the financial systems are disjointed relics of the past. Running legacy software that is over 15 years old. It's really nothing short of a circus. If you are a candidate thinking of joining HHC, join at your own risk. My advice would be to make sure you ask them very detailed questions during the interview (and don't accept an offer until they let you interview with a couple peer level employees). Ask them pointed questions about the high rate of turnover (i.e.make them explain and defend it). Hope I can save some bright candidates from making a career move they'll soon regret.",Howard Hughes Holdings Inc.,HHH,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Howard-Hughes-Communities-Reviews-E723909.htm
"Great Potential, Needs to Improve on Execution",3.0,"Mar 23, 2019","There are plenty of smart, talented people working for the company with a great pipeline of projects to work on. It is clear that the company is making strides to build a true company culture with the incredible effort put into Brand Marketing and People & Culture in the last two years. Shows that they are constantly looking to improve employee engagement with initiatives such as Hello Day and Discovery Tour.","In many ways, the company is still being run like a start up. The lack of processes (or illogical ones with 15 hoops to jump through) has crippled execution. When you are new, or even have been there for several years, and ask what certain processes are, you just get shoved around to several different departments with no definitive answer. Senior leadership needs to step up and set these in place. There is also no unified platform for employees to effectively communicate or share files (not even Slack), something they keep saying they're working on. Depending on your boss and dept, there can be a serious lack of work life balance in New York office.",Howard Hughes Holdings Inc.,HHH,Diversified,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Howard-Hughes-Communities-Reviews-E723909.htm

There are great benefits, some of the best I have seen. If you do you work, there is not much to complain about. There is a new monthly huddle for the whole office where everyone is updated on projects.

Don't take the bait.,2.0,"Aug 28, 2019","Several very talented, dedicated people work here and those relationships are the biggest value. There is some creative freedom but that is mostly because of lack of direction from internal stakeholders. Good snacks, free drinks and all the other usual comforts but that is pretty standard these days.","Totally chaotic with very little synergy between departments. Any ideas are the bare minimum of creative with a ""throw it over the fence"" mentality and ambition is heavily discouraged. It's been described as a ""start-up environment"" but that is just a way to dress up lack of strategy and low standards. Any attempt at departmental leadership comes off as clearly feigned and people are set up to fail constantly. Tonally it feels like you're working in finance and any perks of the office being pretty is clearly for clients, not employees. HHC tries in New York to be culturally relevant but often fails because there is very little creativity in its DNA.

The Chairman and the two CEOs that were running the company while I was there spoke incessantly about how important the people of the company are.

It would've been nice to be paid a severance for the years of service we all gave to the company, especially during such a difficult time.

"Great place, worked there for 4 years!",5.0,"Sep 13, 2021",I started at the company right out of high school and stayed until covid hit. The woodlands resort as well as the Westin in the woodlands are wonderful Howard Hughes properties that offer great opportunity. The work place is very professional where you're treated as family. If you show dedication there's a lot of opportunity to move up as well. Management has always been lovely to work with and the benefits are really good too.,"The only con I felt was that upper management got switched up every couple of years and brought on significant change that was at times at the expense of certain parties and took some time to adapt to, but that's really anywhere.

"Started Good, Ended Poorly",3.0,"Mar 18, 2021","Overall I would say I am grateful for the time and learning experiences I had at Howard Hughes. I was able to work on some pretty extensive projects and collaborate with people all across the company. I am grateful for my manager, they made working at HHC fun and always did their best to advocate for our team. Before the pandemic, I was able to travel quite a lot both for work and training. During my time there I also connected with a handful of pretty amazing people who genuinely wanted to make a difference in the world.","When I first started at Howard Hughes I was over the moon excited. I was experiencing that ""honeymoon phase"" at a new job where everything is just amazing. However, that started to fade out as I soon realized that actions spoke louder than words. The main reason why I left was that I was looking for career growth. My current role was not providing me the room to expand my experience or push my skill set to the max. Another reason I left was I essentially lived in fear of losing my job for over a year and a half for many reasons and to no fault of my own. – In June 2019 the company wanted to be purchased which meant looming potential layoffs if we merged with another company. – When no one wanted to buy the company they did a round of layoffs just before Thanksgiving and another just before the Holidays. – In March 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 they did another round of layoffs. I was fortunate to survive 3 rounds of layoffs, but it was scary waking up every day not knowing if I was next. Lastly, the culture is not what it is promised to be. Politics and Cliques run deep on every level in almost every region, and not just with senior leadership.

Actions speak louder than words,1.0,"Jun 25, 2020",The company has some lofty ideals about what it could one day be - if only it tried to embody those words. Compensation and benefits are on par for the industry. The New York office has a beautiful view.,"We can learn a lot about a company from the way it has handled the COVID-19 crisis. HHC chose to let go of most of its employees, and then send them an email bragging about a ""generous donation"" made to a charity that ""is prepared to provide financial assistance with rent, mortgage, utility and food"" while acknowledging that this charity provides no individual grants and this donation is functionally useless to the jobless employees fearful for their families' futures. To add insult to injury, attached to the email was instructions on how to apply for food stamps. This is typical of operations of this company. The white, male leadership makes unilateral, ill-advised decisions without regard for the advice of those hired to help them steer the company in the right direction. Middle management acts as a barrier between the employees and leadership. Communication is a failure at every level: meetings are held to distribute old, contradictory, or useless information, while useful information is kept secret and employees are challenged to prove why they need critical details to do their jobs. Meanwhile, the nepotistic patriarchy is kept alive and well by creating special positions for the sons of white leadership. Well-designed lip service is paid to social causes on social media (when the lawyers and financial projections have determined it’s safe) but take a look at the leadership – that will speak louder than any pretty, convenient words. If you end up on an interview here, don’t let them read their values off a poster. Ask them how they demonstrate those values.
