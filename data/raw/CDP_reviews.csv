Dream job but nightmare manager. Was never truly part of the team.,1.0,"Mar 12, 2023","The salary was good, but I had to play a lot of hardballs to get what I got. Looking back, I should have asked for more.","Management is a roll of the dice, and I got snake eyes. My manager constantly criticized me and never gave me anything productive to help me meet their expectations. Super stressful work environment and depending on your department you will be treated like an outsider. HQ is not a place for BIPOC unless you are older and prepared to do a bunch of brown-nosing. You must keep your head down, smile, and dance for your teams/ managers. I had a controlling manager that hindered me instead of helping with workflow. What I was promised in a manager and in my job description was not what the actual position entailed. The CEO walks around the office to check on employees constantly throughout the day and will comment if someone is out of the office or working remotely. When you are new, be prepared to have no work/life balance. And it still may not be enough to keep you there.",COPT Defense Properties,CDP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm
Arrogant Manager's Misogynistic Attitude: Creating Toxic Work Environment,1.0,"Mar 21, 2023","One of the things I appreciated most about working for this company is the level of flexibility it offers. As long as we deliver our work on time and to the required standards, we are trusted to manage our time and work at our own pace.","The Manager's behavior has been consistently displaying attributes of an individual who holds misogynistic views. Their arrogance and condescending behavior towards women in the workplace are not only unprofessional but also deeply problematic. Moreover, their management style appears to be unsustainable as it creates a toxic work environment that can lead to high turnover rates and low employee morale.",COPT Defense Properties,CDP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm

Everyone from corporate to management is corrupt,1.0,"Apr 30, 2023",Low risk of losing your job because they are terrible at hiring new people.,"Everyone from corporate to management is corrupt. The compensation plan is changed at the drop of a hat to benefit the company and screw the employees. Some managers are incredibly inappropriate with employees. They care about their bottom line more than their employees and more than their customers. You work your butt off for pennies and are micromanaged by people who should not be in supervising roles.

Sad to see what it became,1.0,"May 5, 2020",I made long term friendships with the other techs and tenants. Vacation policy was good.,COPT was a unique employer when I started and heavily focused on customer service and providing to the tenant. Multiple CEOs later and it became a shell of itself on past reputation and instead become a paper company focused on hitting metrics and accounting at the expense of the tenant. Highly political company. Do more with less became the norm. No clear vision on moving forward and morale was at its lowest when I finally moved on. No defined training plan for the maintenance folks or opportunity for growth left at the mercy of your chief tech. Major disconnect between HQ and the field. Management operated in sillos.,COPT Defense Properties,CDP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm
Run away from COPT!,1.0,"May 23, 2018","They do have excellent benefits, time off, and events.","They are NOT family friendly. Although they give you plenty of time off, they question every single time you take off and give you a hard time. The mentality is very ""corporate squared"" and they love to micro-manage. Specifically the marketing department is a ROYAL MESS. They lack project management, organizational strategies, they have 0 knowledge of what it takes to develop material for the company and the management hierarchy is completely off. It is a nest of gossip! They will rip apart a coworker for the stupidest things. If I would have known how awkward and unorganized, I would have never worked for them! They've had two people in a row walk out on them... that means something!

Used to be a great company,1.0,"Aug 9, 2016",The long time employees who are still there are good people. Flexible work arrangements.,"3 CEO's in 6 years and numerous reorganizations have caused this company to lose its family feel. The customer, which used to be the number 1 priority, has been pushed behind the shareholders and stock price. Cost cutting and doing more with less is the new norm.

You can stay away,"THE TOP MANAGEMENT WAS TERRIBLE AT COMMUNICATION. THEY DIDN'T COMMUNICATE IMPORTANT STUFF, AND HALF OF IT GOT LOST SOMEWHERE. IT CREATED CHAOS AND UNWANTED COMMUNICATION GAPS that could have been east to avoid. It was awful! THE SALARY AND GROWTH OPTIONS WEREN'T TOO GOOD EITHER.

The modern amenities and ergonomic furniture made it a pleasure to work in.,"This terrible company had a toxic work environment, where the well-being and job satisfaction of employees were not a priority for the CEO and management.

They promote people with big egos and presonality issues. Unless you are willing to play the games and pretend to buy into the BS you will quickly find you are boxed into a group or position with no chance of leaving.

Clerical Assistant,1.0,"Aug 25, 2018","Exceptional design and cleanliness to the Columbia office building. The CEO there at the time Mr. Griffin was very personable, smart and diligent.","This was by far my worst job ever. I was offered a job as a low-level clerical assistant working with the two teams, the legal department and investments team. This was my first full time job straight out of college and I absolutely dreaded coming to work everyday. I would go weeks without seeing my manager for the investments team, so many worked and assisted the legal team. The assist I worked under was the executive assistant to the VP of Legal and she did nothing but all day but suck up to her boss while talking about her behind her back and boss me around. She treated me very awful, and would raise her voice to me over little things I did wrong to the point where I would go home crying every day. But, at the same time I felt bad for her because she would be treated twice as as worse by the VP, so most days I let it go. The remaining members of the legal team I worked under were extremely pretentious, rude and unprofessional. I left after only 6 months of being employed there and I decided to resign after I met with my two bosses VP of Legal and VP of Investments for my three month performance evaluation, which conveniently took place 5 months into my employment. At that time they decided to advise me that my performance was subpar and I was taking too much time off from work, mind you I had braces on at that time and needed to visit the Orthodontist pretty often. They explained I was negative and rude to my counterparts, and at that time they were probably right because I had had enough with my coworkers yelling at me and treating me that way. Needless to say I finally got out, six months too long. I’ve had several jobs since that one and no other job I’ve ever been in has ever come close to how bad this one was.",COPT Defense Properties,CDP,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm
