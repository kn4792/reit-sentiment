A Masterclass in Dysfunction — Enter at Your Own Risk,2.0,"Apr 14, 2025","If you're seeking a fast-track to burnout and a front-row seat to toxic leadership, this is the place for you. Micromanagement? Check. Gaslighting? Absolutely. Supervisors who double as textbook narcissists? Say no more. If being ignored when you ask for support and working with disengaged teammates sounds like your ideal environment, you’ll feel right at home. Also, if you're passionate about watching a company celebrate record profits while rewarding employees with the bare minimum — congratulations, you’ve found your match.","The work environment is deeply unsupportive. Requests for help or clarification are often met with silence or condescension. Communication is poor, and collaboration feels more like survival. Leadership is out of touch with employee realities, and concerns are routinely dismissed or downplayed. There is little to no career development, and burnout is treated as a badge of honor rather than a red flag. Raises and recognition are scarce, despite the company’s financial success.",Kimco Realty Corporation,KIM,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kimco-Realty-Reviews-E2116.htm
Dishonest & Cowardly Organization,2.0,"Jul 4, 2025",Attempts at employee engagement were great to see.,Poor working conditions. Building was old and had dead animals in bathrooms that were never cleaned. Organization is too siloed and can’t function together. Any attempt to work inter-departmentaly was met with angst and resistance. Asked to perform tasks that were borderline illegal and manipulate legal documents to avoid “attention”. Leaders are making business decisions motivated by racial prejudice instead of business models.

Accounting Department - Unrealistic work hours & expectations,2.0,"Mar 18, 2025",Good insurance Wellness perks Pizza parties,"Gradually phasing out WFH & back to predominantly in office. People are promoted with zero management, people skills or training. When questioned they state training is not in the budget. These promoted individuals then work around the clock 7 days a week making all work expectations ridiculous for others. You can not take off except when they feel it’s in line with their schedules. 2-3 weeks is are blacked out per quarter. The Accounting department is expected to work many weekends, Juneteenth, 4th of July, Christmas, New Years with no days given back as compensation. You are fortunate to take the vacation days you have due to workload & the fact no one does ANY work for you while you are out of the office. Spring break with your kids, you are not allowed to take off. It is also a blacked out time period. You also need to plan to be in the office as well, so then plan for childcare during that time. Great place to work if you have nothing else in your life outside of work.

Not too Satisfied,3.0,"Aug 2, 2022",One of the PROs is the benefits package.,"- The company provides New hires with a mentor but not everyone is good at mentoring/training. they should have a designated person trained to be able to train New hires. This way the company can benefit from the new hire and ultimately bring the company success. - The company is trying to fit too many roles into one role - Managers & supervisors are micro-managing, instead of working collectively with their team members to get the work done. At the end of the day, aren't we on the same team trying to recover the company's money? Also, they encourage to ask questions but then criticize you if you happen to ask the same question a few weeks later. - The review process does not need to be in written form; which is a major CON because in today's society it's best to have things in writing, especially when it comes to job performance. - The company should have a designated HR person for each dept. or have their HR personnel outsourced, because once you are hired you never hear from HR again.",Kimco Realty Corporation,KIM,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kimco-Realty-Reviews-E2116.htm

The current PFA management team (excluding Michelle Shaver) needs to be replaced,2.0,"Jun 4, 2016","Direct managers genuinely care about the employees and are fantastic to work with. The company is very flexible with employee work schedules and offers generous PTO/sick time packages. Year-end bonuses are around 10% of annual salary plus every February employees are given a stock option payout of several thousand dollars. Kimco offers tuition reimbursement up to $6K annually and matches 401k contributions up to 5%. Insurance benefits are better than most, and they offer optional flex spending accounts for healthcare and dependent care as well.","Most (if not all) managers above one's direct manager are very difficult to work underneath. Many tend to micromanage and want to have their hands in every minute detail, yet when something important is needed from them, they either do not respond or it takes weeks/months to get an answer that should have taken 10 minutes. Upper management makes rash decisions about employees based upon limited observations and does not listen to their management team for input. The work currently being performed by the former Lease Administrator/Analyst position is a joke. Anyone with a brain will be bored to death. I really want to love this company and love the job. Kimco truly is a great company with great potential. It's the current management team that has ruined the PFA team. I will say the current management team has implemented some good changes on the accounting side, but the changes made to the lease administration and collections teams have had a negative impact.",Kimco Realty Corporation,KIM,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kimco-Realty-Reviews-E2116.htm

The founder works hard and he has shown to be intelligent, hard working and respectful.","This became an uncomfortable, grueling place to go back to everyday. Some employees have favor and special accommodations when others dont. Communication is unclear. Many responsible employees are under higher demands and expectations including completing the work of several others with no added pay. The appreciation and respect was not usually given for consistent jobs well done. Common courtesy was scarce. In many areas, management is too top heavy. For example, 3 in management for a staff of 3-4 employees. Micro-managing is very common. The management drives workers into the ground and often takes sole credit for the accomplishments. For years, a department was overloaded with deadlines and pressure and it seemed they wanted robots instead if humans to complete the work. The company speaks of doing well to the investors but departmentally , employees are pushed relentlessly and not always acknowledged, appreciated or fairly compensated. Morale is low. Gradually, the benefit package was decreased. HR implemented a program to encourage getting more steps in each day. This was a refreshing concept until managers showed disdain for those who stepped away from their desk to take a short walking break. Senior management has a boys club vibe. Many employees are fully overloaded with deadlines and tasks. Frequent management changes at different levels caused repeated transition and confusion.

I wasted over a year of my life working here...,1.0,"Oct 3, 2013",Bragging rights to say you work for a publicly traded company. My annual bonus was 7.5% of my salary which is better than average. They pay 90% of employee health insurance and it is a good plan.,"Pay is below industry standard. Work load is unrealistic. As a PM you are responsible for 12 shopping centers. This should be a team of 5, but they expect one person to do it all with one (low paid) assistant. They expect you to use the company issued Blackberry (yuk!) and be on call 24-7. Tenants hate Kimco because there is no customer service. Tenants call and yell at you because they are frustrated and upset. I never received an annual employee review, no increase in salary, no possibility to move up the ladder, no mentors. When you get hired, they say they reimburse for education, but my manager refused to authorize reimbursement for a work related class. If you get a ""title change"" there is no pay with the increase in work load. The computer data systems are antiquated. Nothing is linked together. You have to look 5 places for information to fill out a form. The systems and procedures bog you down from doing your job. If you make a mistake there is someone from the Corporate office who will call and yell at you and make you feel terrible. Why this rude person still works for Kimco is unacceptable!
