"Dishonest Leadership, Toxic Culture – Beware",1.0,"Aug 13, 2025",Free brunches at the end of the month.,"This company has a serious transparency problem — both internally and externally. Many honest, critical reviews on this site have mysteriously disappeared over time, which is why you’re likely not seeing the full picture. If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance this review will also be deleted, just like the others that dared to speak the truth. The work culture at WhiteStone REIT is toxic, fear-driven, and unsustainable. The constant pressure, hostility, and lack of support took a real toll on my health — so much so that I ended up in the hospital for 10 days. No job should ever push an employee to that point, yet leadership here shows no concern for employee well-being. The Chief People Officer in particular operates with alarming dishonesty. After my departure, she attempted to twist facts and submit misleading information to block my unemployment benefits. Thankfully, the truth came out and I was awarded benefits, but no one should have to go through such a vindictive process after already enduring a damaging workplace. The company’s downward spiral is not just internal. Their stock has been in sharp decline since the beginning of the year, reflecting the poor decisions and lack of effective leadership at the top. High turnover, low morale, and retaliation against those who speak up are the norm. If you value your health, career, and integrity, avoid WhiteStone REIT. The truth is hidden behind carefully curated PR and removed reviews — but the problems are very real.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Poor Culture and Lack of Support,1.0,"Sep 7, 2025",Some of the benefits are decent.,"My experience at Whitestone REIT was unfortunately very negative. The work environment felt disorganized and unsupportive, and communication from leadership was often unclear. Employee development and recognition were minimal, which made it difficult to feel valued or motivated. The culture leaned more toward stress and frustration than collaboration, and opportunities for growth were limited. While the company may be a fit for some, in my opinion there are healthier and more supportive workplaces out there.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Great Outlook,5.0,"Jun 22, 2023","CSuite genuinely cares about their employees. They go above and beyond to try to accommodate everyone, no matter the title or rank. Bad reviews prior to the CEO change in 2022 may have some validity. Post leadership change, they are from bad apples that have benefited for too long doing below the bare minimum. Those that continue to criticize the COO or the company in general, need to take a step back and realize that accountability fosters professionalism and more efficiency. The problem isn’t the COO or Whitestone, it’s you. Instead of taking everything personally and retaliating with petty reviews, look at ways of improving your skills and work ethic and lessen your ego. I have found a work family here and look forward to coming to the office. Never have felt this way about a job before.",There’s a few bad apples left that management still sees potential in. They’re stuck in their old ways and negatively affect those who have to work with them. Company can benefit from continuing basic computer skills training. They outsource their IT to a horrible vendor.,Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm

Work on work culture,2.0,"May 24, 2020","Health Perks, Team Bonding Events, Coffee/Snacks. I learned a lot about property management. I had some great memories with specific teammates who were helpful and validating.","If you want a job that talks you down and makes you feel like everything you do is never enough, then join Whitestone. They do not know the first thing about treating hard working employees. Full of criticism, and no positive reinforcements, they expect you to take on more than the job entails, but don't show gratitude for taking on additional roles (just more criticism). The job in property management itself can already be challenging enough, but the toxic work environment makes things worse.",Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm

It is not for Everyone,4.0,"Feb 18, 2020","I have seen this company evolve over time for many years. I can tell you that there have been some major improvements that have been an up hill battle to implement. Is it for everyone, No it is not. Like many places, not everyone is a good fit. There is room for improvement and the teams that are making those improvements are busting the humps to make those changes happen.

Professional,1.0,"Apr 20, 2016","When people first start working with WSR they believe the hype: it's a fun, professional, exciting new atmosphere, where you can grow, and learn more about the real estate business. Honestly, they have been known to take back promotions initially promised, or just plainly disregard employees with the potential to grow/learn other roles with the company.",Stop allowing favoritism dictate how you promote certain employees; Allow loyalty to be earned and not given because certain employees snitch and or lie on employees; have some Dignity on how you address matters that mean something to your current/future employees. Remember how you treat people in the past and in the future will have a direct reflection on your business.,Whitestone REIT,WSR,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Whitestone-REIT-Reviews-E354383.htm
Great Company with Really Great People,5.0,"Apr 11, 2021","Through the year and a half I have been at Whitestone, I have to say that the people there have truly made it a worthwhile experience. Not every company gets to have associates as great as the ones at WSR, and for that I'm truly thankful. They also genuinely care for all the employees, make sure that they're well taken care of. Everyone at this company is in really good hands with really good leadership.

No trust. Nepotism. Toxic,1.0,"Jan 29, 2020",Co-workers. But they leave so its not very good. Everyone is a stock holder. My $50 worth of stock allowed me to get an extra $1.75 a month in dividends.,"Upper management is full of nepotism and they do not hide their favoritism. HR is powerless to do anything real except plan the next health event. One executive I worked for makes you repeat your work even though they have not reviewed it. I on more than 1 occasion made reports for them and was told to make it better with no real direction. I just handed the same report back 2 days later and got a ""that's more like it"".
