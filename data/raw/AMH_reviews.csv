Managers pass the stress on to their employees instead of fixing the issues. Lack of accountability as a whole. Working with HR was a nightmare. One coworker had to have painful injections and couldn’t get the time off approved to recover correctly. Others I heard of were working remotely for mental health reasons and they were later fired. Personally, when I had cancer, working with hr was awful. I wasn’t given any helpful information about my benefits that I found out much later could have helped me financially. When speaking to members of hr they come off uncaring, and extremely rude. The jobs they have shouldn’t carry as much stress as they do considering its normal office work (except for field workers).

District Maintenance Manager,2.0,"Oct 7, 2024","AMH is a place that you can advance your career if you put forth an effort in your own personal development. I started in an entry level position and was able to quickly advance to a mid management position. Eventually, I was able to land a role managing a larger business unit.","To start, work and life balance is non-existent. Every day you must make a choice between your job and your family. If you have children and want to be in management with this company then you better be prepared to make a choice. What is that choice? I'm glad you asked...You have to be willing to sacrifice time with your family. The mountain of work never stops, and the only way to have precious moments with your loved ones is to force a hard stop at a certain point in your day, spend time with them, then get back to work again. (And yes, I am a huge believer in time and calendar management. So if you think you can balance your way out of it, you may need to look elsewhere.) Team Morale - Team morale will almost always be an issue, especially if you manage a field team. Senior level leadership seems to think field employees are expendable, and even if you have a good employee you can just jack another one in their place and get the same results. Unfortunately, this type of mindset is something that leads to management headaches as you are in a constant personnel churn which makes your managers have to step in and fill the void in their team. What does this do to your Field Managers?...Yet another great question. Well, most Field Managers are the best and brightest that came from the field, and they are typically on the edge of burnout and utter frustration. So if you put them in a position to fail and expect them to be at their best, you will likely have some of your team brushing up their resume, or at least reaching out to you several times per week so you can talk them out of leaving the company. There are several other CONS to working for this company, but this isn't the place for novel writing, so I will keep it to this brief description. Also, it wasn't all bad. I made several life long friends, and the local team that I worked with will always feel like a second family to me...You know who you are",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm

The result - toxic work environments, micromanagement, finger pointing and a constant need to play CYA in day-to-day operations. 4. Workloads are not attainable with the current staffing levels. 5. There are multiple overlapping project schedules and some are moving targets. This creates great confusion and a snowball effect when some schedules shift. While stretch goals are industry standard (to stay ahead of actual delivery goals), multiple stretch goals that have conflicting timelines and an overall disconnect between national goals and regional goals cause confusion, finger pointing and in some cases disciplinary action. 6.

Don't Be Fooled-Look elsewhere,1.0,"Aug 18, 2015",Some nice colleagues but that's it.,"If you are considering working for this company, think again. No matter how pretty they might wrap it up with a bow DO NOT BE FOOLED. I am a professional with a few degrees under my belt and consider myself to be a good employee. This environment is so awful I dread driving to work everyday. Although this is a start up company, is it being managed by idiots at all levels from assistant managers to executives. This place had potential but they truly do not care about their employees. They burn and turn their hard workers. Hours are ridiculous and not justified. Females are overlooked for promotions and has a ""boys club"" attitude. Those who question their abusive methods are picked on, then eventually fired or forced to resign. So you have to decide what would be worth it. I am currently looking to get out as fast as I can. I was lied to, backstopped, underpaid, misguided, manipulated and dragged through the mud by those who smile to my face. I wouldn't be surprised if this place has legal actions taken against them. A toxic environment to be in. Morale is neglected. They had a Christmas party planned out at the Cosmo skating rink and some higher up axed it and we got an unorganized crappy pizza with mismanaged drink coupons at Game Works. Then later, others found out there was a fancy formal dinner at the Palms for selective departments. Temps said they were invited and then UN-invited. WHO DOES THAT? Some departments may be better than others, but anything in the Finance/Accounting/Treasury/AP/AR is a mess all around.

The division has crashed, and burned while corporate stood back and didn't know how to step in, and fix the problem. It's a shame, because when we all started our job, we had a good team and enjoyed our job. It basically crumbled due to one bad hire that immediately starting hiring all his cronies from the previous company he worked for, and buried the division.

How about using Property Management Professionals to run a Property Management business?,3.0,"Sep 25, 2015","Benefits are good. Never a boring moment.

Lots of forward movement. I love working where I am needed, and I feel very needed at the company. I feel that I am truly contributing to the future of our industry and to our company (granted, more listening would be appreciated). The HR department is fantastic.","Most positions come with a side order of high blood pressure. Too much secrecy. Employees are kept in the dark for no reason which only induces an environment of distrust, coupled with a weariness about future/current job security. I have witnessed inappropriate gossiping and unprofessional behavior demonstrated by upper management on multiple occasions (this may only apply to my direct managers). Promotions and recognition seem to stem from friendships rather than from merit, experience, or any other valid metric. Far too centralized! You cannot take away the Property Managers primary job functions and give them to someone who knows nothing about the industry and expect a positive outcome. DMs and PMs have been reduced to being collection agents (only they don’t get paid a commission like a typical collection agent does) because they are repairing the damage caused by substandard underwriting. Property Managers and District Managers are made to humiliate themselves by apologizing to countless tenants for the mistakes made by the maintenance department, accounting, the IT department and their glitches with tenant portals and on and on. PMs and DMs are also made to be the in between guy for tenants and the company, which essentially just turns them into stressed out, full time punching bags. It’s disturbing that the departments who claim their power over their specific job duties won’t be held accountable for any of their own mistakes or decisions. Real examples: The auto payments did not process this month. PMs must call all tenants with auto pay, apologize for the “technical glitch” and ask them to make their payment. PM tells accounting not to charge these tenants late fees, but they do anyway. PM now calls tenants again, apologizes for the late fees/notice fees that accounting charged them and then begs someone else to reverse said charges and crosses their fingers that it is actually done. Pricing department sends out a renewal to a top notch tenant with a massive rent increase. Tenant had many unresolved maintenance requests throughout the year, and even without that, the home is already overpriced. Tenant calls PM irate (because pricing won’t speak to the tenant). PM apologizes and says they will requests a decrease in the price and get back to them. PM requests decrease. Pricing denies it. PM calls tenant and apologizes- again… and so on. Is there some mysterious reason the pricing department is not willing to be accountable for the decisions they deliberately excluded the Property Management Professionals from? What sense is there in wasting the PM’s time with: tenant to PM- PM to pricing- pricing to PM- PM back to tenant? Same situation with most other departments. Tenant to PM (because tenant is not getting their maintenance situation resolved), PM to maintenance, maintenance to vendor, vendor to maintenance, maintenance to PM, PM to tenant….. no wonder it’s not being done… It took two days just to ask a simple question and relay the answer back to the tenant.",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm

I am a leasing consultant with the company almost two years and although the income is terrific (maybe it's not that great but I'll explain) I frequently have to question the ethics and integrity of those in charge and what they have us do just to get a lease. Get bodies in houses pretty much. Get them in and then we drop the ball left and right leaving extremely angry tenants which is stressful because you leased the house to them and they have your number and email! Like being threatened? Join! Now as far as income, you will make money. HOWEVER when you factor in all the hours you WILL work, you're really not making that great of an income. Work/life balance? None. Now please believe me when I tell you that I am not some Whitney agent that wants to work bankers hours. I'm no stranger to hard work. But 70 hour work weeks? Every week? And this is intense, non stop stress, non stop fires to put out hours. Like how did 10 hours fly by and I haven't eaten hours. It's not worth it. Especially if you have a family. It's not worth it. I've actually given notice and so I decided to write a review to help the next person. I've neglected my family for almost two years for the sake of this job. I wouldn't even refer people to rent their homes as they do not do right by residents and maintenance is terrible. The corporate office and other offices are filled with people that are in positions that they shouldn't be in because their mom and dad are I high positions. Moms, dads, cousins, best friends, spouses, brothers, etc.... If they were experienced and deserved the position, I'm all for it! But 22 year old VP's? People in charge of pricing real estate that are in Vegas and want to price Florida inventory and they have no idea of the market conditions or even have a clue about real estate! No career path unless you're willing to relocate to a crappy market that needs all the help they can get. I could go on and on but I'll stop here.

Outstanding Company/ Organization to Work for! American Homes 4 Rent,5.0,"Dec 28, 2016","This is a challenging work environment and is not for the faint of heart or undedicated I will grant all day long, but that honestly is why I thoroughly enjoy and value my job here. I have been with the company for many years and have embraced many changes during the growth of this young company. I stand very proud though to be an employee with AH4R. I enjoy the daily challenges and hurdles in turning a loss into a win! If I'm unsuccessful in something, this simply motivates me to try harder to be #1. Management from my experience has and is very supportive to myself and to those that have commitment to what this company is striving very hard to become! As with anything anywhere, money can always be better, but money is NOT everything! Working for AH4R over my years has proven a blessing in many many ways! I strongly encourage anyone who wants to be dedicated and work for an industry leader to apply and get on board! The sky is truly the limit to what can be accomplished working with AH4R! The Houston Management Team (& all others I've encountered throughout my time and across many areas) and above, I believe is beyond exceptional with the end result of Doing What's Right as our primary daily driver!","Compared to other work I've done in many different industries, I have no complaints or cons to this job! Again, I believe this company is not for everyone, but it is for those that take pride in their work and have a high ethical integrity! It is very disturbing to see the negative reviews from past employees and tenants current and past, as I know 1st hand (at least from my perspective in the Houston office) they are not true. Do we have issues and challenges we are working through? Yes, as anyone does in their daily work environment. But, Anyone that gets hold of me gets an honest and timely response! Granted the response is not always what people want to hear, but it is what's right and not dishonest in any way and I I firmly believe that AH4R is about doing what's right for it's employees and tenants! This I feel is our culture all the way through Senior Mgmt to the very top! This again, at least from my experience! But I am one that doesn't take for granted what I have and I certainly don't want something for nothing! If you want something for nothing, please do move on somewhere else to work!",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm

Through continued growth, the entire team has worked together developing a great team and system that is continually developing new ways to save the company money.

It was announced in the 3rd quarter of 2017 that we would be doubling our staffing size and responsibilities. During the announcement, it was also said that with the additional duties and staffing, the Regional Service Managers would be well compensated. However, when our reviews & pay raises were given on January 1st it didn't reflect the added duties and staff count. The raises that were given are the same as other company employees received (2%-5%) that still hold and perform the same responsibilities. I'm happy that I received a raise on Jan. 1st. However, the thing I find hard to accept is the raise I received is the same that I would have received without the added staffing and responsibilities. After reviewing comparable positions in similar industries with similar staff count and supervision, I would have expected around 20%-25% salary increase for the doubling of staff supervision and responsibilities.",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm

Every role being a MAIN ingredient to the growing and adaptive success since its conception. Your voice, your time, your skill set, are consistently adhered to and encouraged.

We held meetings on diversity, educated each other on key issues and adopted policies to keep our network of coworkers feeling safe and taken care of. Other companies threw money at the issues, AH4R fed us with empathy and conversation. From top to bottom there is not one employee that wears this logo that isn’t regularly included in big conversations, or reassured of the companies direction. You simply won’t find that type of transparency with ANY big corporations in this country. I’m proud, humbled and endowed everyday I put on my American Homes 4 Rent Swag.

GAWD AWFUL PLACE!,1.0,"Apr 1, 2016","Do you like being reprimanded for working too hard? Do you like being given completely wrong information by trainers and leads? Do you like being given information from managers who completely contradict one another on a regular basis? Do you like being penalized for that wrong or contradictory information even when you can prove that it was given to you by a trainer/lead/manager?

Are you absolutely impervious to any form of injury or illness with Superman-like guarantees? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then American Homes 4 Rent is the place for you!","Don't get sick. Like, ever. This company does not offer any sick days at all. You can literally be wheeled out of the building on a stretcher and loaded into an ambulance and you will still get an occurrence for it. While working here, I saw three separate instances where people had to be wheeled out of this place by EMT's in the same calendar year! That can't be normal. Do you know how many ambulances I saw when I worked at the MGM Grand offices just down the street from this place? ZERO! It's like this place makes people sick - with all the gas leaks and the fires in the ventilation systems and the AC unit catching fire it actually wouldn't surprise me if this building really were toxic! Also, don't drive yourself to work if you're hired here. Trust me on this. Unless you manage to pull a shift that starts before 7 a.m. you WILL NOT find parking anywhere on company property. The company does offer an overflow parking option across the street and down a spell but it fills up too. If, and only if, all of the parking spots in both lots are full, are you then permitted to park on the curbs - but if a spot opens up while you're working ... LOOK OUT! The company sends the front desk secretary out every single day with a clipboard to see who's parked on the curb and whether or not there are spots open. If your car is on the curb and there's a spot open - she calls a tow truck. I'm not joking, I saw multiple cars get towed while working here. So if you're forced to park on the curb and you're not lucky enough to have a window seat overlooking the parking lot so you can monitor the availability of parking spaces, you become forced to find ways to check on the parking lot at every opportunity. Breaks, lunch, on your way to a meeting. Whatever it takes, so that if a spot opens up you can run out there and move your car into it, and the whole time you're trying to convince your lead or supervisor to let you leave your desk to move your car, you're simultaneously hoping someone else doesn't come back from lunch, park in that spot, and make all of your efforts completely moot. There is also a really odd ratio of black to white management. Hear me out because there are some messed up numbers here. In the call center alone, 10 out of 11 leads are either black or mixed race and the 11th lead is latino. That in and of itself is suspect but it's also a lot better than if they were all white. RIght? But then you look at the upper-management and it starts to become clear if not worrisome. All but one of the supervisors and upper-management in the call center is white and it's the same thing in the maintenance department. Almost all of the leads are black, hispanic, and mixed but all of the supervisors and upper-management are white. Does that seem fishy to you? BTW, FYI - there is absolutely no financial benefit to being a lead. You don't get paid more but you have to meet the same quota requirements as a normal agent in order to earn your bonus. Howver, as a lead you spend less time on the phone and therefore are less likely to qualify for even the minimum bonus. In essence, leads make less money than regular agents do but it's all cleverly disguised under the guise of 'equal opportunity employment and advancement'. Right. To my knowledge, none of the current supervisors in any of the aforementioned departments were promoted to supervisor positions from 'lead' positions. They were either hired fresh as supervisors or promoted directly from agent to supervisor. When you examine all the facts, the position of lead seems to be a place where they put you if they want to appease affirmative action without actually giving you a real promotion. Another thing about being promoted or advancing. The supervisor's bonus is dependent upon the bonus's of the agents under them which means the more agents that qualify for the max bonus on a supervisors team, the more likely that supervisor is to get the max bonus as well. Seems fair right? Until you, again, look at who's being 'promoted' to lead positions or until you want to transfer to a different department. Most of the top 10 performers in Customer Service have been with the company for close to or more than a year but most of the leads were hired less than a year ago. Sure, it's likely that those top performers don't want to be leads because they want that bonus ... but if you actually ask them about it, most of them have never even been given the option. Clearly they know what they're doing and they have seniority, so why did the company decide to 'promote' someone who calls in sick or leaves early every time she menstruates and couldn't pass a drug test if her life depended on it? Because if they promote their top performers, those supervisors are in danger of losing their max bonus - and it's the same thing if you try to advance to a different department. Oh it's cleverly concealed behind yards of red tape, excuses, bald-faced lies, accusations, and even blatant avoidance, but if you're persistent enough all of those one-off coincidences start to look a heck of a lot more like intentional sabotage. And don't bother telling HR because they'll just argue with you and overlook it. And while it's okay to be a top performer and do the best job that they want you to do, please don't actually try to do the best job that you can because then you become a threat and you'll be told to stop. Don't offer to be helpful, don't volunteer for extra assignments, and for the love of all that is holy, whatever you do, don't actually try to HELP a customer. That is not your job. It doesn't matter what department you work in, your job is NOT to help the tenants or answer any questions for them at all. Your job is to ask them a bunch of questions while refusing to answer any questions in return. Promise them a call back from their property manager or a maintenance coordinator, or a supervisor, or even the Pope if you must. It doesn't really matter who because no one will ever call them back anyway, and then get them off your phone within the magical 5 to 7 minute time frame that allows you to take the coveted 60 calls per day in order to earn your max bonus. If you actually try to answer their question or help them with a problem, then you're violating company procedures and codes of conduct. And then there's the tenants! They're all angry. ALL of them. They're angry and they want someone to take it out on and your job is to just take it. It doesn't matter if you're in sales, customer service, maintenance, property management, HOA, or even leasing. Everyone who deals with this company for any length of time eventually becomes terrifyingly angry and frustrated and they will take it out on every single person that they can actually get to answer a phone. Most call centers will allow you to disconnect if a caller becomes verbally abusive, uses profanity and/or racial slurs, or threatens you. Not this place. Nope. You're expected to take it and if you just can't take it anymore and you need to transfer it to the escalations line (because they do have an escalations line) you must first inform a lead and they'll just tell you to try harder to de-escalate because they don't want to take the call either. But really, the misery of the tenants pales in comparison to the internal politics. The different departments in this company are conditioned to hate each other and blame each other for everything so that the company as a whole never takes any blame. Ever. Tenants hate their property managers, property managers hate maintenance coordinators, maintenance coordinators hate customer service, and customer service hates everyone. Anywhere in the building you go at any given time you will encounter people from one department or another talking bad about the other departments every single day of the week. No one is happy. The people who like their job or like working here have either not been here long enough or they've learned to just stop caring. Show up, do what you're told, take your reprimands with your mouth shut even when their unjustified, don't ask questions, don't have any ambition - just collect your paycheck and go home. It's the only way to survive here.",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm

Run Away From This Company!,1.0,"Jan 30, 2015",Base pay and benefits are ok,"The workplace dynamic at the Las Vegas office is terrible. The company is ran by mostly weak minded upper management who base their decisions on gossip, perceptions/misconceptions instead of reality, and will believe anything that their favorite employee tells them. Messy managers and messy coworkers constantly spread rumors about fellow coworkers that they feel threatened by or do not know anything about. They will throw a co-worker under the bus or tell lies in order to move up in the company or accommodate their hidden agendas. If you are not liked, defend yourself, or do not suck up to upper management, they will do anything to try and get you fired. Many great employees who truly cared about the well being of the company have been fired or quit because of gossip, perceptions and misconceptions. Essentially, most of the work place bullies are ""favorite"" employees and upper management who use their power to get their way, control an employee, talk to an employee with disrespect etc. Another issue is that the opinions of coworkers are not valued. Some female coworkers are told by their male bosses that they are too opinionated, confrontational, and condescending even though the ladies are simply defending themselves, or giving an honest opinion/suggestion. Discrimination by some co-workers and upper management is also daunting. Some Black coworkers are told that they are not doing their jobs even though they work ten times harder and do their best to assist their fellow co-workers. When a coworker goes to HR, to help resolve an issue, most are fired because HR doesn't' seem to conduct a thorough investigation. If HR would interview all parties mentioned/present during the incident (this includes other co-workers), they would figure out why the workplace dynamic is so dense and what is the truth behind any situation. There is also no room for growth within the company. Permanent coworkers are not given the equal opportunity to move up in the company for two very noticeable reasons. One reason is because all job postings are not posted online. The most important reason is that when positions do open up, instead of informing permanent coworkers or posting the jobs online so that the public can get a chance to apply, favorite co-workers who do not have the experience are placed in the positions, or temps are shuffled around. Many supervisors within the company were given their position not because they are hard workers, deserved it, or had the experience, but instead because upper management liked them. Due to the lack of experience and because some supervisors and managers only care about their paychecks instead of their employees, new hires are trained and most supervised by fellow employees on their team. Some supervisors and management simply sits back, pretend that they are working hard, and collect their high paychecks.

Jobseeker/Employee Beware,1.0,"Feb 14, 2021",During my time at AH4R I made some amazing acquaintances....,"The Culture: During my time at AH4R I made some amazing acquaintances. I use the word acquaintances intentionally. You will need to foster your relationships very carefully as your connections with others may be perceived as a threat, you might be scrutinized for who you acquaint yourself with, or you may even be accused of organizing. In short, the culture at this company is a concert of high school theatrics, toxicity, and should only be regarded as highly dysfunctional from the top down. Specifically, if you are a person of a protected class be aware wide spread discrimination and retaliation of complaints. Growth Opportunities: There is no room for advancement within this organization even when you do everything right. They will hire who they want, for what position they want, for the salary they want if they “like” them. Be prepared to negotiate your pay, because if you are paid one penny over what they deem to be your worth, it will cost you, if you are bonus eligible, remember its “discretionary”. For eligible salaried employees, at performance review you will be told to lower your self-evaluation so to fall in line with a standard, companywide, annual pay increase generally 3% , if they “like you” maybe more, but then again they have no metrics for the bonus its “discretionary”. Benefits: Typically industry standard, no perks, and certainly no work life balance, don’t let anyone try to convince you of these lies. If you try to use FMLA/ADA protections, you will be targeted and ultimately fired, unless your white, in which case you are encouraged to leverage these protections. Should you ever challenge or simply question the operational efficiency, management, practices, ethics, law, or more specifically your rights? It gets worse. If you are a person in a protected class it is common place practice that you are treated differently, this treatment frequently becomes increasingly hostile and directly discriminant in nature. Should you try to utilize the internal complaint process or open door policy, that is the very instant you become a target of retaliation. It starts with memos to file, that you wouldn’t even know about. Next, you might find yourself on PIP, stacked with remedial and inaccurate details and then a meeting with a member of the HR team only to be reminded that you live in a “Right to Work” State. For some employees the realization that where they work is not somewhere that everyone can “feel right at home” becomes apparent in a matter of days. For others, they see the discriminant treatment happening within a few weeks, “What happened to so and so and so and so ?” Here one day and gone the next. For, those that have survived their first year and maybe the annual evaluation, they might think: “Well they like me, they have not done anything like that to me”, “They wouldn’t do anything like that to me”. Be advised, your number just has not come up yet! The bad reviews are ALL true. The good reviews are fake. This company solicits current employees to write good reviews on their behalf. About 50% of the employees have been around since day one and most are complicit or suffering from job inertia, the other 50% is year over year turnover. Why would you need an entire team of recruiters when you average 500+ hiring of employees year over year, yet remain at the same 1200 or so employees nationwide year after year? You guessed right! Turnover, that’s why. For those considering joining the team: do not be lured by the promise of great work environment, bonuses, growth advancement, great benefits and diversity. For those that are still there: don’t be fooled by the promise of the promotion that will never come, the freedom to gain experience by way of internal promotion, or meetings about inclusion and diversity. It is all for show, a farse a best, but you already know that.

Without a doubt the worst company I have ever worked for,1.0,"May 20, 2022",Working from home… I guess? Although this job will make you end up hating your own home and going back to work in an office will seem like a treat after spending your entire day being screamed at in a call center.,"Where to start? My personal number was given out to my residents. I received dozens of calls one weekend while 36 weeks pregnant and waiting on calls from doctors and insurance, forcing me ultimately to have to block any unknown number from calling me to make the calls stop. I brought this to the attention of my “managers” and received no apology, explanation, or solution. I quit working at this company 6 months ago and STILL receive calls from residents on my PERSONAL number. Maternity leave in general was a nightmare, no one in HR seems to know what’s going on ( just like the rest of the company). My pay was of course messed up during my maternity leave, and to top it off, I was given a raise while on leave and I noticed 2 months after my return that the raise was never on my paycheck. Again, brought to the attention of my “managers”, and given no help other than Payroll’s email address. Before leaving, I had a 40 minute meeting with my DM which resulted in him telling me the reason my residents feel like just another number in this company is a “direct reflection of me as a property manager”.

Wished it could have been better.,2.0,"Mar 2, 2023",Working with a great team of coworkers.,"In my opinion it is clear that this organization has no regard for its employees' well-being or sustainable and valuable professional development. Making money and improving existing processes isn’t enough, they have a “tear it all down and start again” approach that seems to come around every couple of years, placing blame on its people and their obligations to shareholders and investors. For such a young company, the amount of change is so overwhelming that there isn’t enough time to excel at anything before leadership makes another loosely informed pivot, driven by spreadsheets, reports, and external pressures, rather than real world applications and accurate data. It's quite apparent that the company is chronically understaffed by reading its reviews and hearing from its people, leading to unrealistic expectations, which have resulted in an exceedingly negative work environment. The lack of resources and support within the company is concerning, as it creates an environment where employees are forced to make do with what they have and salaried employees can only work longer hours leading to further stress and burnout. Leadership disguises these issues as challenges to overcome, however at this level they’re blockades to any real progress or refinement. The favoritism shown by the company is abhorrent and demotivating, leading to a culture where it seems like only a select few are valued, appreciated, mentored, promoted, and cared for. This, coupled with the lack of patient, supportive, and motivating leadership, has created a toxic workplace that seems to be going nowhere fast and is upending in chaos. It is unsurprising that the company appears to be experiencing significant attrition rates, given the severe problems outlined. It's quite evident that the company is not interested in investing in its employees, leading to a revolving door of talent that ultimately hurts the company's bottom line. There have been so many widely known management departures that I am surprised people would still apply to work there. In the interest of checking boxes, they mandated diversity, leadership, and ethics trainings to garner bragging rights for training and leadership development, while pandering for their highly coveted “Great Place to Work” designation. Unfortunately, that survey does little to quantify or address the actual problems this organization has, electing to only pay attention to the demographical and social virtue signaling of the survey fueling the lions share of that designation. Simplified: Great Place to Work doesn’t mean what you think it does. A couple of years ago the company expended some effort trying to convince its employees that they care with some new benefits, an emphasis on culture, and raises to elevate current and prospective employees to the market rate. This was encouraging, but since then they have adopted a “return on investment” approach by shrinking budgets, staff, and placing more emphasis on squeezing every dollar out of everyone and everything. It has removed any sense of culture, fun, pride, and genuine pleasure working there. In conclusion, I would not recommend this company to anyone. The numerous issues that it's currently facing are indicative of a company that does not value its employees or their contributions.",AMH,AMH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AMH-Reviews-E669975.htm
