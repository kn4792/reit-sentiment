"Grateful for a Long Career, but Culture Shifted in Recent Years",4.0,"May 13, 2025","• Camden is very technology-forward; systems and processes are streamlined and efficient. • Professional, collaborative work environment with many dedicated and talented team members. • Over my 33-year career, I met so many wonderful people and built lasting relationships. • Communities in the Tampa area are well-maintained and reflect strong operational standards. • The employee guest suite perk is one of the best benefits—affordable and far better than a hotel stay.","• As a General Manager overseeing two communities in Tampa, it was difficult to consistently connect with all team members due to constantly moving between sites. • Compensation and benefits became less competitive. My new company offers more PTO in my first year than I received in 33 years with Camden, and a 40% rent discount compared to Camden’s 25%. • Since 2020, the company culture has shifted from personal and people-focused to more transactional. While Camden still promotes its “Have Fun” value through events, the underlying atmosphere has become tense, with a lack of genuine trust and connection. • I often felt like I could not rely on or trust my superiors, which made it difficult to feel supported or secure in decision-making. • Favoritism became more common—performance and experience were often overlooked in favor of those who played politics. • In the Tampa area alone, three out of four General Managers left within the last year, which speaks volumes.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Over a relatively short period 4 long term employees of which some had 30 years plus of service with the company choose to leave or were asked to leave citing a toxic and unsupportive work environment. These departures are not only a major loss of knowledge, but a clear red flag about the current leadership in Tampa, Fl.

Onsite vs. Corporate,3.0,"Jun 14, 2025","This is a hard review because I'm trying to do an average of my thoughts working onsite vs. thoughts about corporate. - I had an amazing manager & team to work with. If you work onsite, your team will absolutely make it or break it for you. - Give you your vacation all upfront, no need to wait for your vacation to accrue. More companies need to do this! - Fun outings & appreciation weeks planned for onsite staff - Christmas & year end bonuses","- If you are Asian, RUN! During Covid, the company did all these initiatives around ""Black Lives Matter"" - sent out a company wide email about the situation and how they were going to donate money etc. Around the same time of the BLM movement, ""Stop Asian Hate"" started as well. There were no initiatives for the ""Stop Asian Hate"" movement so I called the CEO out on this. I had a call with him and he basically said, ""they can't comment on all situations happening in this world"" LOL. Obviously, this is a publicly traded company so they had to do something for BLM. But to be told that your race movement isn't as big of a problem as the other race really rubbed me the wrong way. Either say something for everything or do nothing about everything. I left the company a couple of months after that all went down. (I reapplied years later just to see what would happen and they immediately turned me down haha even though my manager said he would rehire me in a heartbeat. Companies hate to be called out on social issues.) - You have probably seen this word floating around in these Glassdoor reviews for Camden - ""cult vibes"".

Camden Property Trust Lives up to Their Values,5.0,"Oct 11, 2024","I wish I found this company sooner. I have been in the multifamily industry for over 20 years, and this is by far the best company I have worked for. The culture is second to none. Camden truly cares about their employees, their residents, their vendors, the community at large, and all the relationships that manifest out of exceptional service. Our leadership is stellar providing unlimited support and insist on us in keeping a healthy work-life balance. They provide quiet hours for our maintenance teams, great benefits, stock options, upfront PTO, and my favorite employee perk is the guest suites they allow employees to stay in for only $20 a night! I truly love the people I work with. Everyone, and I mean everyone, from the top down, is always willing to help when called upon. At Camden, you have a voice and never feel like a number- they see the value in each and every employee and treat us with care. Camden just feels like home, and I am so grateful that I have the opportunity to work where I do every day.",It is difficult to find a con with Camden.

Everyone I have met in this company is friendly and fun. I’m not sure if it’s the culture that keeps people this way or they hire people this way to keep the culture but everyone is nice and outgoing.,"Limited room for growth in the Contact Center but it can also be seen as a positive since leadership rarely leaves ( a good sign of a good company). I work overnight so it’s a bit more limited but what is nice is that you have the ability to apply for different departments/roles and the supervisors are supportive and encouraging. I personally haven’t applied for any other department at this time but there have been other agents that have while I’ve worked here and they were able to make the transition into a different position. Newer agents have the ability to make more than older agents starting out but this isn’t exclusive to Camden, the Contact Center or the position as a Customer Relations Advisor, as it’s common in most companies and jobs that new hires make more due to budgets and other things being reevaluated every year.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Changed For The Worse,2.0,"Mar 7, 2025","Specifically, this review will be for anyone who is working on-site (managers, leasing agents, maintenance) and I'll start with the good here. When I first started with Camden it was great. Good pay/benefits, lots of opportunity for advancement, good people, residents and employees were treated well.. Support systems are great - you'll have someone to help cover all of your bases and aren't expected to do or know EVERYTHING (all budget responsibilities, contracts, invoicing, etc. for your property like other companies.) There is some beauty to this company (even still). Mainly, the people you work with day in and day out. These people are the reason you stay (even more so as a manager who hires them). I have a special place for all of my team members I've worked with over the years and will likely keep in touch with most of them.","That said, a lot has changed over the years.... We removed simple amenities for the resident's enjoyment - just the little things! No more coffee downstairs, no more resident events, just to save money. Then we organized our structure which typically eliminated one manager position and one or more leasing agent PER PROPERTY - gone are the days where Leasing Agents can get promoted to Assistant Managers, AMs to CMs, so on so forth. There's just simply no opportunities available because the workforce was cut down so much. Why?? It saved the company over a million dollars a year. The result other than money savings? Employees are overworked and burnt out, residents are less confident and feel like we don't care as much anymore, and residents are really left out to dry in most scenarios - none of this money has been added to budgets and Operations funds continue to shrink year over year. Most of the money goes to Capital asset preservation funds (this is 100000% needed, don't get me wrong). That said, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ideas and plans get shut down every year because Camden dimply doesn't want to invest in resident satisfaction anymore. We're making sure our properties are ready to be bought by someone else, not improving the lives of our residents (Camden's alleged mission statement). Results also don't matter to upper management. It doesn't matter if you always meet or exceed goals year over year if you don't ""drink the kool aid"" in this politically based hierarchy. You have to fit the bill of the cult like personality/fake cheerleader image they want if you want to advance. I've seen multiple managers denied opportunities or lose out to lesser managers purely because the lesser manager doesn't fit the cheerleader bill. They're level headed, calm, and effective at their jobs and get punished for it. Versus, someone whose property has high turnover, is messy, misses budgets, BUT is over the top friendly (often times spending more time talking than doing actual work) and they go to EVERY company event. The overly friendly person who gets mediocre results gets the promotion over the better performer that is more even-keel and may miss events because life gets in the way. Lastly, to really nail home the point that good employees don't matter as much as money... I've seen multiple properties be sold. It's part of the business and it happens. However, when a property is sold and, inevitably, employees need to be let go, Camden decided to NOT retain the FANTASTIC employees who have years of experience and keep the ones that have been here for a fraction of the time, a fraction of the experience, and a fraction of the value. Why?? Yet again, MONEY. Get rid of the great employee who does everything right because they make $4 an hour more and keep the one that's still learning what left vs right is because they're cheaper. To summarize, their mission statement should be as follows ""Guided by our values, we are committed to being the [most profitable] multifamily company by providing [mediocre living] to our customers [and maximizing value for our shareholders instead].""",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Not what it used to be,2.0,"Aug 15, 2024",There’s a fake attitude to make you feel like your managers happy you’re there. Health insurance is decent,Honestly over the last year it’s really gotten bad. The management has really made life for you miserable while pretending everything they’re doing for you is your benifit. Be ready as maintenance to work until 6 and work 10 days straight and when you’re not working those 10 day straight you’re short staffed half of the week while that person is off. They’ve obliterated bonuses completely so you don’t get that anymore. They’ll buy you lunch once every few months if you go above and beyond breaking your back to (hopefully) get recognition for it but it won’t go past your property manager. They’ve directly instructed all office staff..even leasing..to micromanage maintenance telling them how to do their job and asking why things aren’t done yet..all day every single day. You’re made to feel that if you don’t get it done as they request when they demand it that your job on the line (because it is) d yourself a favor and just don’t even bother. Many people have left that had 20+ years with the company over the last few months because of how bad it’s gotten and can’t take it anymore.

I appreciate Camden,4.0,"Dec 12, 2024","I have been with Camden for several years and am extremely passionate about this company and my contact center team. Working for this company has been an incredibly rewarding experience and I have grown and learned so much during my time here. From the first day it was clear that Jackie and Alison prioritized their employee’s growth, satisfaction, and collaboration. Our leadership team is visionary and are always there to support us. The leadership team works hard to maintain our thriving culture and encourages teamwork. We have a wealth of training material that is available to each CRA to help them with their calls and allows them to maximize their job performance. One of the things I appreciate most is the focus Jackie, Nichol and Alison have on our work life balance. They each genuinely care for their employee’s wellbeing and offer flexible schedules when we need it. When my mother passed away there was such an outpour of love from my team. I received regular check ins and was given the time I needed to handle her affairs. I never felt pressured to come back quickly and was told to take all the time I needed.","Being apart of the contact center has had its challenges. There have been times I felt under a microscope and that the performance bar was set too high. But over the years I have learned that the contact center is set to a higher standard for a reason. We are the first point of contact for a lot of our callers, and we have several people within our company that expect the contact center to outperform. This can be stressful at times, not only to the CRA but I am sure the leadership team as well.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Camden Listens,4.0,"Oct 10, 2024",Camden is a company that listens to their employees and makes a real effort to make changes for the good. Everyone at Camden has a voice.,"The pay and the discount are not market competitive. We lose a significant amount of people because they find jobs with higher wages and a 40 percent discount. Even in my current position, I am not earning what others with other companies make. Even the bonus is much lower.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm
"Great Company, Terrible Department",2.0,"Nov 20, 2024",Contact center agents work from home which is convenient. The benefits are excellent and I feel the founders do care and try to show their employees that they are valued overall.,"Training: Training was inconsistent and unorganized, leaving you feeling unprepared to start the role. There are well over 30 “guides” you can pull for reference but in real time, during a call, it can be cumbersome as well as stressful trying to research when the conversation lengths and hold times are being monitored. There is also information and regular updates posted in Microsoft Teams regarding updates to guides which only makes it more difficult to locate information you may need as you have to check multiple avenues for the most up to date information. If you attempt to reach out for help as encouraged, via the “supervisor on call line”, you are made to feel like you are disturbing them and are incompetent for asking questions. Environment: The environment is incredibly micromanaged and your performance is intensely scrutinized. You are graded on 3 types of calls a month resulting in a performance grade for the service you provide. They also hop in and “live listen” to active calls, sometimes commenting in real time via Teams and distracting you from the task at hand. Email, text and chat templates are in place for you to utilize and the supervisors review every email you send. It feels at times they are looking for reasons to “coach” you. As an agent you do a little bit of everything and are held to the highest level of perfection while wearing multiple hats. You are yelled at, berated and degraded routinely by the callers and are regularly held accountable for mistakes that are not your own. If there is ever a time someone on site, at one of the properties reaches out pertaining to how you handled a situation, even when handled by the very specific guidelines that are put in place for you to follow, via the guides, the supervisors will almost always immediately side with them and imply the agent is incompetent and did not do their job correctly, only intensifying the feeling of being undervalued. In the event you ever have a bad day, or show the slightest indication that you are human or your demeanor in a call is seen as rude, you run the risk of being fired. This department has the highest turn over rate I’ve ever experienced at a company and if things continue this way, so will the turn over rate. Management: The management team initially gives the impression they are kind, supportive and open to feedback however this quickly changes once onboarding ends. As mentioned before, it feels uncomfortable reaching out for help however this is complicated by the extensive micromanagement and the fact that you are not allowed to make decisions based on your experience or without ensuring they will approve. Again, you have guides to reference however there are many instances where the situation is considered a grey area and again, you are not allowed to make decisions for yourself as there are rigid guidelines to be followed. While you are encouraged to be “transparent” and reach out if you ever do have concerns, the moment you do, you are gaslit and it’s implied you are the issue. You run the chance as being seen as problematic and unprofessional, even when bringing concrete examples for what your concerns are based on. There were multiple agents that were targeted and ultimately fired after they expressed issues they’ve had with the leadership, the work environment and/or training. Some even went to HR for assistance only to be met with the same end result. Unemployment. Culture: There are a lot of nice things the company generally does for its employees from holiday parties to employee appreciation day. The contact center specifically has customer service week and the supervisors have fun raffles for the department which is fun and very nice. They also send birthday and anniversary gifts which is also nice. It’s important to note that there is a severe imbalance of diversity in this department. There are 10 or 11 leaders in management and they are all Caucasian except for 1. There were multiple leaders that have left the department only to be replaced with more Caucasian leaders that had not been in the department as long nor performing as well as other agents, including agents of color. There have also been multiple agents of color that have left the department and/or company due to not being given the opportunity for growth after repeatedly requesting the opportunity for advancement. This is disappointing and disheartening to see. Compensation and benefits: The benefits and perks are excellent. The pay is just okay and due to the rising cost of living, it is barely enough to scrape by. New agents are making $6-$7 more than those with experience and tenure in the department which is discouraging. This department is 24/7 and Camden boasts itself on having 24/7 customer service for residents and prospects however the 24 hour option is put on the backs of only 6 overnight agents. The contact center never closes, so while you get paid for “paid” holidays, you do not get all of these days off like the rest of the entire company. Also if you work on any of the holidays, you do not get paid the standard, time and a half holiday pay for working on said holiday. There is also not premium pay for the overnight team. You are given a yearly bonus and raise however, they are distributed by agent preference and not by performance. A colleague and I received the same exact bonus and raise one year though I had been there a year longer and my performance numbers were much higher. When you attempt to discuss your compensation with leadership you are again hit with gaslighting and told it is not in the budget.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

If you look at other regions, we seem to be having a different experience here. At the regional level, they’ll tell you it’s a gap in Camden culture. Truly, that’s just leadership passing the buck. LA is a tough market, and requires a more hands-on approach. Also, with a high turnover and often times being short-staffed, you don’t get much support, or even recognition as a team for your additional efforts. This is discouraging when you’re giving your all. We had a long stretch where 50% of our team was missing and we kept the community operating smoothly. Still waiting for higher-ups to acknowledge our efforts. A few encouraging words go a long way. Moving up is challenging when the ultimate decision makers are out of touch with your operations. With the lack of LA inventory and nothing on the radar in the near or even distant future, you need to be open to other markets (such as OC and San Diego) if you’re looking for growth in California. Otherwise, a REIT with a larger presence in Southern California might be a better fit.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Covid vaccine and poor leadership at the top,2.0,"Oct 12, 2021","Good benefits and kudos to training team and new diversity efforts. I have felt like I had a better, more supportive relationship with my trainers than my managers. Bonuses are nice too.","A company should never be ok telling it's teams what to do with their body. We don't mandate aids testing, we don't tell you you have to quit smoking or diet, and we don't mandate the flu shot. Why is COVID any different. If someone cut themselves at work and it turned out they had aids, that is a death sentence for them and the person they infected, yet we don't have that in our protocols. Truly upsetting that this is Camden's idea of doing the right thing when they overlook so many other things that could easily be justified under the same reasoning. The other reason for the poor rating is that Camden is on to the next thing so fast that they don't stop to really put together a plan and research, they just shoot with no aim often missing targets and forgetting about the people who those decisions are impacting. It's no wonder we keep losing people at an alarming rate. We definitely do not pay our maintenance enough or give them the resources they need. They just get buried day in and day out.

DO BETTER CAMDEN…DON’T WORK HERE,1.0,"Mar 31, 2023",My co-workers (NOT my supervisors) were amazing beautiful hardworking people inside and out. Definitely made some true friends within my team especially with what we had to go through and deal with together.,EVERYTHING. 1. ZERO WORK LIFE BALANCE. Getting off at 6pm even when you live on site destroys your day especially if you have a child or pet. By the time you get home take care of them the night is done. Being at work BEFORE 9am and off at 6pm is awful I would much rather NOT have a lunch break and get off earlier so we can have an actual life other than the hell we lived. My coworkers agreed. 2. The pay is GARBAGE considering my team was managing (nesting) two properties all the time and constantly trying to keep everything together for two properties with the same number of people you should have at one property. STOP being greedy and hire more people. The “Nest” sucks it’s literally organized chaos at its best. When your employees can’t afford to pay rent on time to live at a Camden property WITH their 20% discount without using both their paychecks in a month something is wrong….we work to LIVE NOT LIVE TO WORK. EW. Oh and when you do get excited thinking you have an awesome incentive check coming it gets taxed about 40%…so yeah. 3. Supervisors- They love to give you warnings and pull you into the office and list everything you are apparently doing wrong but not anything you do right for them. As if that is going to make you work harder? It just makes you want to leave and never come back because you learn that no matter what you do it’s never going to be good enough for them because they will scold you on things you were never trained on or not properly trained on. When you try and always hold yourself to the Camden Standards and play the part they will ruin your day by pulling you aside and lecturing you on how bad you are at your job (extremely motivating lol). Then you eventually find out among your co-workers that you aren’t the only one they do this to…they literally call each of you out (even the all star veteran employees) on stuff that you would never expect aka we are all secretly getting in trouble 24/7. 4. I became so depressed in my time at Camden that it literally had awful physical and psychological effects on me. Just a few days after being out of their my nervous system start recovering and I felt like a new person. I wish I would have left sooner. I can’t believe I let myself get so depressed and to just get further in debt when I could be doing a better paying fun job instead.

They preach all about being a team but at the end of the day, its everyone man for themselves. They rather hire externally than internally. People who have been within the company 5+ years having no advancement opportunities, but if you know the right people, raises and management opportunities whenever available. For the amount of work, the pay is ridiculous. Not only will you be a technician, but you will also be a full time groundskeeper and housekeeper. Another huge issue- overtime!

Great company with a lot of hidden bs,3.0,"Dec 16, 2015",Very great company overall. Provide some room to grow with good benefits and training.,"Training courses are mandatory during your work days, sometimes days off. They are usually long and there is minimal useful information since you sometimes take the courses after you've been an employee for months. Management can be very hard to talk to and HR is nearly impossible to reach. There is a lot of favoritism and once an opinion is formed of you it is hard to shake. You are also signed up involuntarily for volunteer work that the company sets up, even if it is your day off. If you are a Leasing Consultant you will probably never get a weekend off, and will have to fight to get vacation days depending on your manager and property. During slow season there is a lot of busy work and not much focus on training to get promoted unless you ask for it. Hourly pay is decent for a leasing consultant with no experience. But there is not real scale on who makes what (despite what you hear in interview). You work overtime, but they really dont like to pay out for it so you end up having to take long lunch breaks or come in later to balance out the time.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

If there aren't open opportunities within the market you're in, there are lots of markets located within desirable cities to live in all over the country. -Pay is really solid, especially compared to competitor companies in the market. The incentives for leasing and manager bonuses are a nice addition. - The culture is really positive and every team I've worked with at different sites has been really welcoming and kind. -The work life balance is fairly good! As a leasing consultant or assistant manager, working so many weekends can be tough, but they are transparent about needing to do that when hiring. Having week days off after working a weekend can be nice as well! -Fun company events such as ACE awards and leasing rallies. Hopefully those come back post-Covid! -Forward thinking company that is ahead of the curve on a lot of technology advancements in the industry. -Good benefits including vacation suites and employee discounts living onsite.","-Some of the policies have gone downhill over the years, mainly in terms of charges and fees. It seems like fees are constantly increasing, with nothing for the residents to justify or show for it. -Turnover has seemed to increase over the years. Hopefully we will go back to having long tenured employees. I think a lot of it has to do with scheduling and working on the weekends, so hopefully this may become more flexible in the future.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm
Pros and Cons,3.0,"Jul 13, 2021",Camden culture is great. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. They really do want you to succeed. There's so much room for growth and everyone welcomes you wanting to climb up the ladder and helps you get there. The mentorship program is awesome and allows you to learn so much more and experience different properties. Overall it's a good company to work for that offers you stability and growth opportunity.,"For a company that really tries to sell you ""work/life"" balance. There is none for an LC. You get one weekend off a month, which is ridiculous regardless of having days off during the week. Working every weekend and holidays will wear you down. The office being open until 6:00pm every day is also difficult. There really is no work/life balance if you work every weekend and until 6:00pm every day. It's not realistic or sustainable long term which is why people leave. The dress code is also not realistic. We are very strained on what we can wear and it is NOT inclusive for people of different body types who work in different climates. There has to be more leeway on what we're allowed to wear. So many styles and colors being restricted makes it hard to feel good in what you're wearing every day.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

A TRULY Great Place to Work!,5.0,"May 24, 2020","1. Camden is never afraid to lead our industry. As evidenced by the Camden Cares Resident Relief fund, where we distributed over $10.3 M in resident relief, Camden boldly seeks opportunities to help those in financial hardship - even during a global pandemic. 2. ALWAYS seeking to do the right thing in regards to their Employees, Residents and Business Partners. Our relatively conservative financial management has afforded us the ability to maintain staffing levels even amid a nationwide economic crisis. 3. Encourages Employees to Always Be Learning - not just to make Camden business processes better but, to for their own self-edification and development. Even during a time of uncertainty, Camden continues to invest in Employee Training and Development.","I totally understand the rationale behind the geographical footprint we occupy - we exist in markets where there's good job growth. That makes perfect sense. Maybe there's another metric that would justify growing our geographic footprint. Is job growth the end-all-be-all to what sustains a vibrant multifamily portfolio? Maybe the answer to that question is an opportunity to Grow the Business and perhaps Transform the Business? The idea here is to: 1. Create more opportunities for growth Camden Employees 2. Improve the economies of the new markets we enter AND 3. Make Camden a more visible model of what a successful company is such that there are more Camdens out there - making the lives of people better, one experience at a time.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

A Fish Rots From the Head Down,1.0,"Jul 9, 2020","Profit-sharing, employee stock program, Bonuses, and Commission","Leadership will actively discourage your growth and block you from promotions. I was told directly that the office "" vibe"" was off and that I would not be promoted based on my individual merit and performance until the behaviors of others improved. I've applied for multiple jobs and had amazing interviews only to be blocked even after I gained approval before applying. The funny thing is it was acknowledged that I was ""qualified, educated and intelligent"" so I can only speculate as to why I continue to be blocked for a promotion. I've never experienced anything like this in my 16-year career. I could write for hours about the failures in leadership at Camden. Bottom line, only take a position with this company as a stepping stone. Don't expect to be supported or valued, and definitely don't expect a promotion unless you fit their version of what leadership should look like.

Hands down- the best company to work for.❤️,5.0,"Mar 18, 2021","I write this review with sincerity & respect for Camden. I have been an employee for over 3 years and I can confidently say that it is the best company I have worked for. I write this review to let everyone know that if you are looking for a company that cares about you as a person then this is the one. This past year, like many others, my family and I have faced so many challenges from my husband being furloughed to recently losing a loved one to COVID-19. During this difficult time I had to be out of the business but my leadership was very empathetic & supportive. “Nothing is more important than your family” is what I was repeatedly told. “Just let me know what I can do for you” is all I heard. I have had the pleasure of working for two amazing, CM’s whom have been so understanding and have no idea just how much I appreciate them. Their leadership inspires and motivates me to give 100% each and everyday. I can only imagine they feel valued as employees and in turn make me feel valued as well. Some might say I have been lucky and that might be true but what I do know is that I am team Camden, through and through. 💚",I have none to mention at this time.,Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm
Okay Job but Missing Leading,2.0,"Dec 12, 2021",Good health care benefits & Employee rent discount,"A lot. Long working hours & work weeks (6-8 days straight typically). You work every weekend besides 1 a month. And you work until 6pm during the week & 5pm during the weekends. OH & when you work the weekends you only work 7 hours on Sat & Sun. So you have to work 2 extra hours during the week if you want to hit 40 hours. You work most holidays & only have the day off on the major ones. So you’re back in the office the day after Christmas, thanksgiving,, New Years & the 4th. Camden rigged their work week to start on Saturday to legally have people work 8 days straight without a day off. There is little work life balance. Corporate is probably great but property operations is not nearly as rewarding. All of the videos you watch during on boarding shows corporate in Houston. Which shows they know the office jobs are the more beneficial jobs than on site operations even though we were the ones actually doing the hard work & making the company money.

You can only take vacation if you have PTO and once you are out you're stuck until the next year, which is difficult when you only have 2 weeks of PTO. There is a lot of turn over in certain regions and you are always having to train new employees and it can become stressful at times.

Pay can be better for the amount of work but not bad especially with commissions.","There is consistent drama and politics and this is a fact. The fast majority of the employees are females that like to form cliques and gossip about anything and everything rather it be related to them or not. There are inconsistences in policies amongst properties and you are critizied/fault if you are learning how a certain property does things. Sister properties have rivalries so intense that it sometimes gets taken out on the residents.

You are required to participate in the Career Wear program, which they provide funding for, however, the options are extremely limited to dull colors and ill-fitting styles.

Not only to the employees, but also to the residents. The Camden Cares Resident Relief fund (during Covid-19) was on of the most amazing things I've seen a company do. They gave over $10 million to our residents and sent them out before the government had even sent out stimulus checks. They also gave all onsite employees a bonus for working on the front lines during the crisis.

It was very odd and hard to be on her team as no one respected her.

Ultimately I was looking forward to having a long and successful career with Camden but it is not worth the ongoing harassment and dismissive attitude from upper management and HR. Work place harassment is not taken seriously which is completely shocking as Camden is advertised as a “great place to work”.

Better than most,4.0,"Feb 15, 2018",Camden is a great company. They give managers and assistant managers a company card which is often used for free employee lunches.

I'm always excited to come in and get people a new home and to share the Camden Culture. Also, Camden has so many great benefits for their employees that continues that trend of setting them apart.

Company has Terrific Promise but Inconsistent Execution,3.0,"Oct 17, 2018","Compensation plans are very generous to community managers and maintenance supervisors. This is especially so, given the bonus structure to include stock rewards annually. Lease up programs are also very generous with the stabilization bonus trip. There are also bonuses in place based on company performance alone and are in addition to individual or property performance. The option to have a discount at any community and extend that to a family member in lieu of the employee is also very nice. Specific markets are more challenging, given limited inventory, geography constraints, and or pricing for housing. Training for associates is extensive and Camden does offer a spectrum of resources to set associates up for success. The mentor on-boarding program is a terrific introduction to the culture and sets an example of the tone the company looks to incorporate. Camden does a lot to create their brand and provides on site management with tools to “do the right thing” for their customers. The flexibility of managing operations and making financial decisions is a big win for the organization. It offers autonomy and buy-in. Support departments and community online resources are well stocked. Camden seems to have support person for every department and or role. This makes on site operations very streamlined. Engaging with these departments at the annual conference is also a huge help and creates long lasting bonds. This extends to the CEO’s and board members alike. All of whom are engaging, warm and create an experience unlike any I’ve seen at other companies. While the search feature for online support needs some tweaking, the information available is expansive. The online dashboard is also an invaluable tool and takes a huge burden off of operations and also offers universal transparency. The business services team is also very forward thinking and is constantly looking to provide helpful and ingenious platforms. While the progress is not always over night, it’s supportive to see that it’s in motion. The IT department is also extremely responsive and apt to provide a same day resolution. Upon start date, all login criteria is made available and team members have instant access to necessary platforms. The development team is a well oiled machine. You can tell how effective the collaboration process is and the projects show that in the thoughtfully curated details. While Camden doesn’t operate everywhere, the new and redeveloped sites are typically well-thought and meticulous.","Growth is limited unless you are willing to relocate to another market both outside of your regional city and or state. California specifically has only 12 properties currently in operation and very limited development in the pipeline. Compensation should be evaluated on a regional level and based on the cost of living. Offering a universal housing discount doesn’t create a competitive offer when you compare markets like Houston and Phoenix to Miami and Los Angeles. While the company is competitive within the REIT world, they operate in markets that are saturated with third party and private competitors. Within these specific sub-markets, fully comped units and percentage-based leasing incentives offer enticing packages and ultimately provide sustainability in very cost-prohibitive locations. Rather than working in a reactive manner, to counter offer associates who are leaving, or adjusting base rates after associates have left, a more in-depth market analysis should be created. Over the past year the company has seen onsite turnover for over 2/3’s of its community managers. Long-standing team members with 8-10 years of tenure have now dwindled down to 4 years or less. This turnover exposure was also mirrored in subsequent roles such as the maintenance supervisor and assistant manager roles as well. The Los Angeles market alone, saw turnover for all three of these roles at over 66%. Employee disengagement is a direct result from a lack of leadership. The regional office for Southern California is lacking in connection with its on site team members. The absence of support has systemically translated into devaluing great employees. Expecting high performing team members to burden the excess of vacant roles is not a sign of true leadership. Team members are not motivated by affirming words of encouragement alone. Tangible support efforts, strategic operation-based planning, and a “boots on the ground” approach would all yield more productive and team-based results. What’s more, hiring regional level supervisors who are new to their role, new to Southern California, and or have never worked in the Los Angeles market, are missed opportunities that not only put the supervisor at a disadvantage, but the on site team as well. For a manager in this position to then utilize a 4 hour monthly visit, in order to have adequate understanding of the market and or their site team, is beyond unreasonable. Local communication for career opportunities is disappointing. Employees often know ahead of time who will be given a role and this has been communicated by regional management. The unprofessional politics and discouraging communication to employees is very disheartening. With the open communication culture the company strives to create, upper management should be more tactful in their approaches. Follow through is also lacking. Employees should be provided with a career path and direction, rather than simply being told that they are not the right candidate. Training programs are still a work in progress. Limited in-person training is not effective and travel to corporate office for training is not the best use of time, especially given California’s challenging traffic. Some material is also out-dated, not market specific, and is not role specific. For example, plans should be created so that managers are not taking leasing 101. Maintenance is also being directed to take training for cost saving operations wherein the regional expense savings do not align with the rest of the US. Development plans have become exercises instead of training tools. Management lacks commitment to consistency and follow through. Strategies and communication protocols also change on a monthly basis, making expectations confusing. While this experience has become a reality in Southern California, it does not appear to have the same effects throughout the country or at the home office in Houston. All of which make the Southern California market the more disappointing.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Culture in the gutter,2.0,"Feb 9, 2022","Slight discount on rent, great insurance","Culture is promoted heavily by corporate in the couple company rallies throughout the year but it is not prevalent in day to day realities. Definitely has a “drink the koolaid” mentality. In actuality the on site team is heavily overworked, sometimes working for 10 day stretches (before the decision was made 2022 for Sunday’s to be closed). Now there are some teams that have no way to have their days off be together, ie since Sunday is an automatic day off they may have to have their second day be Tuesday-Friday based on coverage for the office. So while we no longer have the long stretches, we likely will not have a full “weekend” of time off. Base pay is low. The commission is one of, if not the, lowest in the industry. Employee rent discount is at 20%, but rents have increased by several hundred dollars in the past couple of years. Salary has not so more and more employees are unable to take advantage of the discount. Overall, I have found myself to feel more and more stifled compared to what the promises were when I first started. The big promise is employees first, then shareholders. I’ve put several years into this company, long enough that I can feel that the shift is now not employees first, nor residents first, they are concerned about making more money for the company. Community budgets are being cut and a couple random bonuses were sent out under the guise of “outperforming” when we really know they are aware of the strain they are putting on the on site team and are trying to save face and retain employees.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Tenured employees can agree, the juice is not worth the squeeze. -FAVORTISM, FAVORTISM, FAVORTISM. -LISTEN to your on-site employees who are getting burnt out. Time management & delegation is not the answer to everything. -Rental rates are high and we are told to sell the importance of why due to our service and living excellence. When in reality -If you are on-site and your community has crime incidents, RIP to any hope of reassurance/help from higher up. You may get security for a LIMITED time. Or have them regularly scheduled but reduce what days and times they are at your community to save money.

I really debated sharing the negative because I’m generally not a complainer and there was a time when I really loved this place. However, in the end I decided making it public might encourage someone to make changes to get them back on track. So here it goes... - Blatant favoritism, especially from the VP level - Very low pay - Witnessed sexist remarks by certain members of leadership - Has changed from living the culture and showing team members how to become an active participant in creating culture, to manipulating employees into participating. - Was made to feel like I would be retaliated against if I didn’t answer company surveys favorably or leave positive reviews on the company. - Tried to manipulate me into signing a no arbitration agreement. I believe the exact way it was presented to me was, “yes it is technically ‘optional,’ however, it is in the best interest of the company and would be in My best interest to sign.” I felt certain had I stayed, my not signing would have hindered my growth in the future - again, this is only speculation, just wanted to share how my leader made me feel. - On more than one occasion I witnessed leaders show up to volunteer events, take a photo for company promotional purposes, and then leave without ever actually participating. - Low growth opportunities - Did not feel valued even when I was exceeding my goals",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Camden Property Management Review,2.0,"Jul 12, 2013","Although scarce there are still great leaders at Camden that can bring it back to what it claims to be. The benefits are good, the product is great and its reputation with contractors is outstanding. No doubt Camden pays its bills on time and takes care of their communities.","Camden has been an incredible company in the past and will be again if...the principles of the company stop and look at the big picture. Below I have listed some events that I feel support my statement. When the economy took a flying leap of the planet in 2008, Camden made some big changes including semi-dismantling the construction part of the company... regrettable but I can only assume necessary. Unfortunately they placed the head of construction in charge of the operation people side of the company. Maybe they didn't realize they were promoting self-centered, selfish, and self-serving people on a take no prisoners type of mission. For the sake of identification, I will refer to them as the ""Houston Mean Team"" or HMT. They were responsible for the divide, conquer and eliminate movement that has been going on ever since the HMT took over. As the HMT got their claws in good and solid they began placing their own friends at the top of the food chain. Their true colors didn't start shining through for a while, but enough has happened that the principles have surely noticed. Although the principles verbalize that they appreciate and care about each and every person they employ...the buck stops there. The HMT has systematically eliminated anyone they feel doesn't fit their idea of a ""leader"". To them a leader doesn't question, state an opinion, disagree or argue, they expect you to do what you’re told, and if it’s not right... too bad...take the blame. The HMT might make you look like you can't handle the position you were hired for or… you are very negative. Camden use to allow for individual thinking and encouraged discussions, opinions and suggestions, to some degree they still do but... no one dares verbalize it. Not if they want to end up out of a job. For the most part the HMT did a good job of making you look bad while they laid track. This process can take a while but to them it’s worth it. Those that take on the HMT might find that they receive an e-mail requesting their presence at the corporate office...the employee might ask if everything is ok...they might be told everything is ""perfecto"". Once they arrive at corporate they might be greeted by a senior supervisor with a hug and a smile...walk you down to another supervisor’s office with their arm warped around yours as if they are a best friend. Before you even sit down they may tell you they have decided to dismiss you...the employee might ask why they might respond with ""it’s in writing in front of you...read it later and leave""...then they might escort you to the elevator...get in with you and smile with great satisfaction all the way down. But they might give you one final demand before you leave...they might tell you that you better not contact your friends at Camden. The HMT's opinion of themselves is so much so they think they have the right to tell you what you can and can't do even after they have kicked you out the door. I remember when the principles use to be proud of how long team members had worked for them, they use to ask us to stand up based on how long we had been there. They would call out One year...more than two...more than 5...and so on. Unfortunately the principles have not asked that question over the last two years...I wonder why... I believe Camden can and will turn it around, there is a young man who is being groomed to take over the family business...as it should be...conversations with him speak volumes about his character...he will bring Camden back to what it was...one of the best places to work.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

I enjoyed my time with them. When I relocated specifically for them just to deal with a boss from hell who fortunately got let go but a little too late (let's try about a year and half later of serious complaints that were ignored/taken with a grain of salt). They are now a company that is about their own profit, listens to the residents that don't deserve to be heard to violate fair housing and try to say it's a customer service thing when in reality it wasn't. A company should back its employees and not be one sided aka only listen to one person who had a secret vendetta and won for a while.

Camden has changed over the years and not for the better,2.0,"Dec 15, 2016",Camden has great benefits. Bonuses. Fun employee events.

Company Values,3.0,"Apr 25, 2016","On paper, Camden Property Trust is a great company to work for. They are consistently in the Top Ten of Fortune's Best Places to Work list, and I suppose that may be true at the corporate and regional levels. If you enjoy unique perks such as vacation suites, company events, and sales meetings that are more like playtime, then Camden is absolutely a great company to work for. There is an immense sense of camaraderie amongst employees, even those that you don't work with on a daily basis such as team members from other properties, regional offices, and even the corporate office in Houston. You can truly make life long friends at Camden.","In training, at ACE Awards, and at sales meetings and regional events, Camden places a high importance on the Camden Values, but in practice, it seems as though all of those are pushed aside in the name of instant profits and instant gratification of shareholders. The amount of work that you put in is not nearly on par with what the compensation is. Depending on the region that you're in, forget about upward mobility within the company. If positions do open up, they are filled by popularity and not by merit. Camden also made the list of best places to work for millennials, and I tend to think that it is because of all the unique perks and ""have fun"" company value, but if you're a millennial who is success driven, this is probably not a good fit for you.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

I have been with Camden for over 10 years and hope to be around for another decade. Employees are supported in both their personal and professional goals. Salaries and benefits are competitive, and our employee vacation units have come in handy for several family vacations.","With a relatively small company and low turnover, it can take longer to move up. However, Camden makes sure that all employees can develop within their roles and position themselves for promotions when they are available; there is no wasted time here, only time spent learning and growing.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

Camden is as good as the person standing in front of you,5.0,"Oct 30, 2013","* Excellent benefits. Insurance, 401k matching, employee stock purchase program, EAP, discounts, scholarships for children of employees, etc. A friend of mine left Camden (in a lateral move) to work for Greystar making about 5K more per year. Her insurance expenses more than doubled and ultimately took a pay cut. She also recognized the loss of value the company had on each employee. After a couple of years now, she is still surprised at the lack of interest in her personal contribution at Greystar and found that the grass was not greener, it wasn't even grass. * Camden's insurance is good, there are several options depending on your need, and I've never had an issue finding a good provider. * Competitive salaries in addition to really good benefits. (not just benefits, GOOD benefits) * Business practices and procedures are founded on experience, feedback and good Values. They listen to their employees at ALL levels. If front-line employees are disgruntled, unhappy or think their supervisor is unfair they provide hotlines and feedback avenues. HR doesn't take that sort of thing lightly and they don't ever take sides, they are fact-based, legal, moral and fair. * They want to be the best employer in addition to being the best multi-family (R.E.I.T.) housing provider. They work as hard to keep their employees happy as they do to keep their customers (renters) happy. The want to maintain the ""Best Place to Work"" designation so they seek feedback often and make changes based on the feedback. * Management is intuitive and often provides systems, support, or programs before the teams even know they need it.","* Like any organization, they can have people in positions that can have a negative impact on fellow employees, customers and subordinates. I have been employed by at least four other multi-family organizations. None hold a candle to Camden's loyalty to their people and their customer. * The last two years have been more difficult than normal. Updates in software, hardware, systems and some practices have been more difficult to understand and deliver on-site. Employees at ANY other multi-family company would treasure and safeguard every effort Camden makes to support their teams. Employees at other companies and would roll their eyes at whining front-liners who sit online and write how bad the company instead of using one of the 11 ways they can DO something about it. * No matter what company you work for, or how much support the organization offers, there will be people who don't fully represent and execute Camden's Values, Brand and Promise. **Even though Camden blows other companies away and is driven to be an amazing employer, one person having a bad day, a bad life, or a bad attitude can interfere with their intentions.

"Good company, property managers vary skills.",3.0,"Feb 23, 2021",They have great benefits and for starting pay they are high. Camden has a great training program at the district office for your first few days. The company as a whole gives back a lot to both employees and residents. Paid time off. Vacation and sick time comes up front at the start of the year.,"Management is not consistent at each property. This affects your training and room to grow. Camden also is at times too customer focused. Early office closures due to weather are rare and come last minute if there is one. It is looked down or fawned upon to reach out to leadership outside your office. No additional training outside of your first few days unless you sign up for it, but even then your community manager does have to approve it. Meaning you still might not get training. Incentives could be paid out at a higher rate considering how much money Camden brings in. The office technology is very outdated. You also don't always get interviewed when applying for other communities within Camden. You can apply for an open position but it is a good chance Camden already gave the job position to someone else, they just post it because it is policy to. You won't always hear back from sister properties' management about your application and you won't always get an interview. This goes against Camden's views on growth within the company. Not flexible with your schedule at all. Management refuses to help out or work on weekends. This causes 7-9 day stretches and still not hitting 40 hours due to the weekend hours. Part time no benefits.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

The leadership is consistent throughout Camden; They focus first on the good work that people are doing, and always take a coaching approach where there are opportunities for improvement/growth. Employee's opinions are valued and it's a collaborative environment where all sides are considered when big changes are being made. Technology and innovation are a high priority as they spend money on resources that make our jobs easier, and make serving our customers more seamless. Growth potential is limitless for those who are especially talented at delivering exceptional customer service and living our company values. The job can be tough at times, but it's extremely rewarding to work for a company who values their employees. I can give countless examples of how Camden has proven to care over the years including them giving us surprise bonuses, stock shares, constantly improving benefits, hosting fun events, and so much valuable training.

Working for Camden,3.0,"Mar 20, 2017",This company is very team oriented. A positive and fun environment has been maintained since I started with them. You will rarely ever take your work home with you.,"There is little room for personal growth. There is basically one track to take with the company if you start on site and your advancement is very slow. The main problem I have with this is the lack of anyone caring. If I try to discuss my future with anyone above me they seem to get very uncomfortable (even though I've received stellar performance evaluations every year). For such a ""good"" company, the lack of personal attention to the employees is shocking. They send out reviews asking for feedback, but the only categories they discuss are if we think Camden is a good company and if we would refer a friend to work there. Each year they make fun of the small percentage of employees who do not think it's a good company and who wouldn't refer a friend. They're missing chances to keep tenured employees happy, and I've witnessed three of my close friends quit this past year alone (all over five years with the company).

Smoke/Mirrors,1.0,"Nov 16, 2021",On boarding is exciting. You feel great to be a part of a different type of organization. An organization that cares.,"After onboarding you realize you’ve been blown a bunch of smoke. The culture died years ago and the proof is in the voluntary 40+ % of the company that turned over in the last 10 months. Many of these were long before the vaccine mandate. All this company cares about is money, nickel and diming customers, reputation, and their stock price. You will feel pressured early on in your employment and every time a Forbes survey comes out to share about the great and unique culture . (Email from CEOs/senior leaders on how important this is for our company). You will be told how much tenure is in this company. A lot of tenured employees chose to leave and the ones left will also tell you things aren’t the way they used to be. Upper management will ask you to spend your own money to save on expenses.. Micromanagement thrives here. You cannot speak up unless you want to be barred from any forward movement and I’ve seen many people blocked from great opportunities. If you’re looking to interview ask these questions and pay attention to the answers. - what did layoffs look like during covid? - why did 40% of the company leave Camden? - what are things that were done for employees and residents that don’t happen anymore and has the company benefited financially from the lack of those events. -what did Camden do for on-site employees during the pandemic in terms of labor?

Not what it used to be,1.0,"Nov 10, 2017",Benefits are good and the corporate suits are a plus.,"I worked with the company for 6 years. It used to be very customer focused. Our number 1 goal was to help ppl find a new home. At a time when ppl were losing their homes due to the economy we did whatever we could to help their transition into an apartment as comfortable as possible. I loved my job because I loved making my residents happy. A few years ago there was some major changes at corporate. It seemed at all the ppl that had been with the company were getting fired and all theses changes were happening. It turned from customet focused to money focused. No more waiving app fees or late fees. No exception!! My manager told us that every cent counts. She had me call a past resident from 2 years ago fort a $1 balance!!!! On top of that I couldn't except payment over the phone or online because it was such an old account it would not accept so I had to ask her to bring it in. On top of that we didn't accept cash either so I had to bring in a cashiers check! This was a resident who had lived with its for 7 years and who had written great reviews for us and then we put a bad taste in thier mouth over a $1!!!! Same manager had each of us employees make fake profiles on yelp in order to get great reviews so she would look good. We used to only chafe ppl for cleaning, paint and carpet shampoo.

The guest suite makes traveling less expensive.,"A previous review pretty much nailed it. This is a very cookie cutter environment. If you don't conform to the rest of the herd, you get pretty uncomfortable very quickly. People tend to be very cliquish and gossipy, and I saw so much conflict between Camden Values and the reality of how things worked, that I dreaded going in. Benefits are mediocre. Nothing to write home about, state of Texas offered better benefits as well as more time off. Perks are only good if you are able to use them-sometimes it is so hard to book a suite, there's just no sense in trying. The apartment discount was nice, but in order to live in a spot with decent schools you have to sacrifice your commute. Vacation and sick time are a joke and trying to find a healthy work/life balance is close to impossible. I love Ric, Keith, and Malcolm- I think they are fantastic people, but I also think that that they are going to have a hard time retaining talent if the perks and benefits aren't able to compete with the ever growing number of companies that are looking at how to do things outside the box.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm

I get the idea that things need to be done in a timely manner however, I also understand that it is also important to work as a TEAM!!! ... when I first got there, there was no problems everything worked out just fine, manager wasn't calling you every 15 minutes asking you ""are you done, are you done yet? are you done yet!?"" while saying a unit should only take 2 hours to do when walls are coming apart, none of the doors are shutting and utilities is in really bad shape, meaning these things were not even searched out before this ridiculous rushing time limit was placed on the head of ONE person when it supposed to be a team effort. Supervisor barely listened to anything that I had to say or what anyone else had to say. The place was run like a prison, extreme micro management to. Absolutely no remore for the only 2 other techs while the supervisor spent majority of his time in the shop the other 2 would be doing all the work. If I was working on something important he couldn't even take 2 minutes to throw away something at the compactor but instead I get called from clear across the property to come and take care of it ... who decided to hire this guy!?! Anyways from the time that the new supervisor came in till the end it was a complete nightmare ... you talk about being black balled?! that was IT! .. It seems all they like to do is FIRE people without working together to see where the mistake came in .. everyday felt like a hostile environment ... but what was really going on was that I was ultimately slowly being pushed out of the loop .. all properties at camden are not like this though .. i just so happened to end up at the wrong property ..",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm
