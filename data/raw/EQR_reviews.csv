Some of the most inspiring senior leadership I've ever had the chance to work for. This team takes care of their own, makes a point to get to know every one on site, and will take the time to teach, develop, and groom their successors. Most importantly, managers actually get a say in their decision making, and the senior leadership team consistently backs them up and believes in their choices (even if they may not entirely agree). You have freedom to really ""think like an owner"", but that also comes with the responsibility of acting like one. The on-boarding process to secure talented candidates has improved greatly over the last few years. Our recruiting team really takes the time to find the perfect people to complete your team, instead of sending you just anyone. Leasing consultant turnover is minimal, and a lot of LCs stay in one place (which is beneficial to a new manager). Most turnover I've seen has been due to promotions. Which is in part, due to the training and development team.

Lowest Leasing Commission Rate In the Industry,2.0,"Feb 26, 2016","Gives you experience in all aspects of residential real estate. As a leasing consultant, you not only lease apartments, but deal with resident's complaints, service requests, lease renewals and transfers.","The lowest pay in the industry by far. Base salary is at the low end, but the commission is a joke. You have to lease 5 apartments in a single month just to make over $500 in commission. They pay a tiered commission rate that is way below any other residential landlord din NYC. After leasing 6 apartments you reach the ""high tier"". This is when your commission rate becomes comparable to other landlords. Most landlords in NYC pay 10% of the first month's rent towards commission, not even close here. So good luck leasing over 6 apartments every month just to get to the starting point of the commission that other landlords pay. Its almost insulting to the intelligence and handwork of the leasing agent. Besides the low commission rate, you are also expected to handle a great deal of resident management work (which you are paid nothing extra to do). However you do get to deal with renewals, at a little under $150 per renewal. Although, its not easy.

There is a strong push toward ownership and responsibility on the individual level. However, the concepts touted fall flat when the individual exercises them.","Managers and coworkers make the climate. Without purpose, direction, and understanding it is easy to loose motivation. For maintenance professionals, the training is all ""hands on"" or on the computer. The computer training is from the company, but the on job training varies greatly from supervisor to supervisor. As a floating service technician, I saw the majority of properties in the DC metro area. None of them had similar standards. Most of the supervisors rely on verbal instructions over proper training. With that said, from my experience, the number one con is lack of leadership. There are plenty of bosses, but no leaders. Furthermore, there tends to be a coercive atmosphere from the management. It seems that everyone believes the customer is always right. However, it isn't exactly true. If a problem rises between the customer and employee, there is a tenancy from management to convince the employee to please the tenant. Sometimes this violates laws and policies (i.e., fair housing act and etc.). In my case, when I mentioned this grievance to management, they blew it off. Eventually, I wrote the CEO and I finally got some attention. Eventhough he deeply cared, the lower he held on of management took passed the buck onto other employees, claiming that they lacked loyalty.

Properties are short staffed, only 1 person per 100 apartments which is not enough for resident's expectations. Employees are told to put good reviews on google, ratings websites and glass door for the company. Even the annual employee survey is rigged because the VP can pull statistics for regional portfolios and tell who is giving bad reviews.

About half the leasing consultants I started with in training left by the time I hit 6 months. -Understaffing: Even with high turnover, they do not fill positions quickly (sometimes months) which leaves an already understaffed office with very little support. I've seen them take advantage and completely burn out so many great employees to the point of quitting. -Work/Life Balance: You barely get any holidays off and most employees work weekends (even managers) -Manipulative management: Community and Regional managers know how to manipulate their employees when making decisions about their careers (transferring communities, promotions, quitting, etc.) and are always only looking out for themselves and their own careers.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Overall, you have the opportunity to work with great people and have a stable, reliable career.","As a large, successful corporation, you don't have to worry about going under, but this also means that all decisions are made with consideration for maximum revenue above all else. Policies and procedures dictate everything, which can be comforting but also frustrating in the lack of autonomy. You also have to be ready to relocate to advance, particularly quickly. The competition and drive to be the leader in the industry means that while work/life balance is talked about, those who don't practice it get ahead.

They encourage you to take time off when possible because they recognize that the better employees are treated, the quality of work increases. I have never felt more confident in a job as I do working for Equity. I truly feel like I can grow with this company and reach for positions I never thought possible. Equity thrives on promoting from within and cares a lot about experience and less about an unrelated college degree. Many VP's and Corporate employees have started from the ground up in this company/field. There is a reason why Equity is one of the top Property Mangement companies in the U.S - residents appreciate the passion and drive behind the company which starts with the employees.

Equity encourages their employees to be themselves and senior leaders are very supportive. The pay is fair (not bad/not great). The benefits are great.","Working with a lot of great people makes it a very difficult place to promote. Equity sold many communities in suburban areas which now means to move up, I would also need to move to an urban area. The staffing module is thin.

At other REITS it has felt as if Maintenance/Facilities we're part of the so called untouchables when our Corporate leaders would show up. At Equity it's the exact opposite and was a bit of a shock to me. The fact that our Local Corporate team remembers our onsite staffs name including porters is amazing. I made the right choice moving to Equity. There is a sincere passion for serving people that at other places has been forgotten.

In addition to try to learn my role I feel like there is always unnecessary drama floating around that make it difficult not only to focus but to want to be engaged in my position.

Company on the decline....,1.0,"Apr 19, 2022",Mostly remote work and fairly independent depending on your manager.,"Dramatic cultural shift over last 3 years. Horrible investment officers who would previously not be tolerated were able to keep their jobs and were instead sent to ""training"" which they again failed (based on coworkers reviews). Sad state of affairs for a once great company. If you are salaried, you will work your fingers to the bone just to be rewarded with an annual raise of 0%. The most you can hope for is 3% every other year at best. That compensation strategy is now reflected in the attitudes of employees. No one gives 110% anymore and people are jumping ship left and right. All competitors pay more than Equity so they no longer attract top talent and they continually understaff.

Taking away all promotion opportunities,3.0,"Mar 31, 2022","Friendliness and belonging with coworkers at the property, beautiful apartments can be a cool work environment, OK benefits. Company invests in technology and wants to be cutting edge.","When I started at equity a few years ago I was excited about the opportunities for growth I saw at the company. As an LC who eventually wants to become a manager I looked at the few dozen properties in my area and saw room to grow and hopefully get promoted with hard work and the right training. If you work in property management you know some properties (bigger more challenging ones) are meant for experienced managers and other properties (usually smaller ones) are for beginners where someone new to the leadership role can learn the ropes before taking on a huge building where they would get overwhelmed and burn out way too fast. These small properties are important for workforce development for this reason. Well since I started, every time managers of a “beginner property” leave their job, instead of hiring a new one they just combine that property with another property. This has happened with 3 or 4 buildings in my market that I can think of just off the top of my head. A raise and title change will then go to the manager presumably for the added workload. The LCs who now have to work at not 1 but 2 properties do not get a raise…commission does not count, I could lease more in a full day at my home property than I can split between two properties). LCs see no base pay raise for now having to manage 2 books of business instead of 1, and having to memorize the ins and outs of 2 buildings instead of 1. It is seriously additional work for the leasing staff to now be responsible for 2 buildings yet only the person at the top gets a raise... Equity saves massively on payroll and benefits by doing this. And at the same time they’re removing the chance for an assistant manager or an LC to take the next step in their career. I used to be able to name 8 or 9 beginner properties. Now I can name maybe 4? With 2 of them being merged right now as we speak. There is no place for us anymore. The small properties are being combined, and the big properties we will never get hired for because we are not ready and have no CM experience…you see the problem here. Again this has happened three or four times in just a few years….Every time is a punch to the gut for all of us who want to move up. Based on conversations I’ve had, this is their strategy now. The way of the future. I don’t know what their long term strategy is training their existing workforce…especially because they are now automating and centralizing so many parts of the leasing job, it’s obvious they want to get rid of us LCs. Which is fine because I don’t want to be an LC forever… but how exactly am I supposed to become a manager now? Equity avoids layoffs (they know the optics…) but they will lose people via attrition and not rehire, forcing the remaining staff to take on a higher workload. It is a sneaky way of reducing payroll and they think we don’t all notice or discuss it. We do. Everyone is afraid to speak up publicly including myself. Plus we know nothing will come of it….am I supposed to call the action hotline and report management for doing exactly what corporate wants them to do…? They know what they’re doing. HR knows the drill too. There’s no one to go to other than Glassdoor… The residents of these merged buildings also suffer. Now there is one manager and half the property presence the residents are used to. Fewer staff means things get missed and screwed up and the residents get a reduced level of service. And guess who has to deal with them when they're angry...not upper management, that's for sure. I get it from a money lens but as an employee in what is basically an “up or out” situation, there’s no ladder up anymore…so I guess you are forcing me out.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Every Rose Has It's Thorns,3.0,"May 22, 2019","The company offers competitive salaries for new employees, ample PTO/sick time, a standard employee discount of 20% and, most importantly, they are owned and managed by the same entity. This creates a consistent level of customer service for the residents and prospects. Equity's changing culture places value on resident satisfaction and work/life balance for its employees. Most of the Regional and Community Managers truly care for their charges. The message delivered by 2 North is positive and employee-centric.","Equity has not combined their PTO to include both vacation and sick time, so employees who are not ill often lose these hours when they leave the company. The bottom line-driven operation style of the company creates a ""no money to do that"" mentality for its employees and residents. Smaller communities are given an inordinately small budget for resident functions and prospect refreshments. Managers often have to get creative and solicit vendors to fund these events, which can come off as cheap and uninspired. Capital projects are often scaled back so far from their original concept that site staff members are confused and unprepared on how to share the message with prospective and current residents. Human Resources team members are not in place to protect team members, but rather to protect the company. Exit interviews are held sporadically without a real intention to resolve issues. Instead, they are mere formalities and an opportunity to scout for detractors. Renewal conversations can be difficult with existing residents, because Equity often asks for higher increases than market conditions would seem to allow. Property Manager's opinions are footnotes to the greater conversation on pricing and it is rare that your thoughts create change. Managers are responsible for a budget that they do not help to create.

Lots of wonderful and talented people to work with on your team.,"Work/life balance is a non-factor particularly for the department I worked in. Burn-out factory to the nth. A point that was driven home to me when I took the job was the average tenure of employees that worked there. I believe I was told ""14 years"" as an average. I just had a child and was looking for a way to make a better life for me and my family and stability was a very attractive variable in my decision equation. In fact, this was so important to me that I took the job knowing they offered 1 week of vacation starting (from my 4 weeks that I used to have) and relatively inferior health insurance benefits. They offered an amazing bonus! I took a chance. After two months, I knew I made a mistake. At first, it was the overwhelming amount of emails that got to you. Every. Single. Day. Then, it was the embarrassment of being chastised in group email distributions. Then, it was your ability to make progress on anything because you were lost wasting time on nuances that you couldn't let go because you were told to find a resolution on a problem that could occur when a far-reaching hypothetical may occur(but never could). Everything is controlled and micro-managed... through email. You watch as good people get fired or simply leave and your own happiness of your career path gets completely seeped away. There is no opportunity to blaze your own path. Anonymous feedback to management was met with ""if you don't like it here, you can leave."" I left. At the end of my time here, I was the longest-tenured member of my team and I couldn't bear it to my 2-year mark. If you value any time of life beyond Equity, this is NOT the place for you. If you have kids, don't come to this department because you will miss them growing up. If you love to work, great, but no chance of recovery because for some reason 1 week of vacation is acceptable in the USA in 2018 (time of my hire). You will neither advance nor will you be happy with where you're at unless you are whipped like a slave and then like being whipped. The department has a significant culture problem. Management created it or is it. Upper management simply doesn't care. I'm sad because my instinct was to stay where I was, but I took a chance on an unknown. Equity killed my passion for what I've been doing for more than 15 years. I'm no longer in the industry and it was the direct result for working at Equity.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Compensation and Work/Life Balance,2.0,"Jan 22, 2023",Most of the people are great Most of the properties are beautiful Good opportunities to gain business and sales experience The company has well-established infrastructure and resources There is job security and an optimistic outlook for the well-being of the company The company encourages feedback and change in many ways No dealing with 3rd party ownership,"Prefacing this by saying I really care about this company and the people in it, but compensation and work-life balance, unfortunately two of the absolute most important things in a job, are just severely lacking. COMPENSATION - Target is now offering wages competitive to what Leasing Consultants/Assistant Community Managers are making, and even some newer CMs. You also see how much money the properties pull in, and how little of it is spent back on the employees. A small raise in this economy (when you're already making a low wage) when our industry is already lagging in pay, after seeing rents go up by hundreds and properties pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars each month, feels like a slap in the face. It can feel like you're just a bunch of grunts onsite putting in the dirty work while investors line their pockets. WORK/LIFE BALANCE - Working in a leasing office, you will see it all. You will be tested and most likely pushed past the limits of what you can handle emotionally and mentally. You will see mold. You will see floods. You will see crime. You will see death. You will see extreme weather events. You will see complex maintenance problems. You will deal with a level of Karen you never even thought possible and they're with you for 12+ months. You represent the landlord, so people treat you with zero compassion, and you frequently have to advocate for things you might not agree with yourself for the good of the business. It is a thankless position to be in. The properties never stop, so you can and will be dealing with emergencies and abusive emails around the clock. Hours and days are not flexible. You will be dressing up every day, you will be on-site every day, you will be working in a leasing office trying to do your job tasks that allows you to be interrupted at any time by a resident, phone call, vendor. It is a very difficult work environment to be in. On-site teams are mostly skeleton crew status these days, so you even need to be very careful about when you schedule your own PTO. If you don't set very careful boundaries and have good practices for managing stress, time, and your mental health, you will be chewed up and spat out.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

No loyalty to employees. Business is business I suppose.,2.0,"Oct 30, 2022","Promotes diversity (although if you look at the top of the chain, it's all older white people). Might just be a marketing strategy to make them seem inclusive. Many of the properties are very nice. Events which acknowledge employees achievements. Training modules are good with ongoing training throughout your tenure.","Management plays favorites. Promotions happen based on if your friends rather than work ethic/accomplishments/experience. They encourage you to get involved with all the extra curricular activities (volunteering, councils, etc). Some people have families and don't have time for all of that. A promotion should be based on the ability to do the job at hand, not if you have volunteered or signed up for something. Reminds me of highschool. Although they promote diversity, racism is rampit within the company from all sides. I have seen many good employees leave as they were accused of unfounded racism, then, to no surprised, replaced by someone who fit into the office better. HR will always be on the side of the accuser, never the accused and many play off of this. Equity has a motto to ""question authority"". Don't do it. Your manager will write you up. Once you start questioning anything, upper management starts whispering about you and soon you will find yourself without a job. Unqualified employees are hired. Equity really needs to do a better job with vetting new employees. Causes a lot of issues. New/unqualified employees are often kept over a more seasoned, experience employee who has been there for years. If you're a manager and have trouble handling a situation and ask for help, there won't be any. Then if you make a mistake, you will be the one leaving. Raises are not giving. If anything, the max you will receive annually will be 3%. This equals 30-60 cents a year. It's insulting. I addition, new hires will be hired in at a much higher rate than you. Equity does not believe in fair pay. Comission- the commission structure is awful. Many other companies will offer higher commission. For renewals, they recently took them off site to a centralized renewals team. This caused many employees to lose income. They have no concern for this and no plan in place to compensate for lost income. Management is very quick to point out any mistake you've made, small or big, and almost never acknowledges hard work. Equity truly does not care about residents. I realize it is a business, however, often times many residents will come together with requests, opinions, advice, etc. Much of which is very valid. However management just brushes it off. The way they see it, the residents can move out and we will re-rent the apartment. I've even seen it where a leasing consultant will go out of their way to assist a resident, just to be scolded by management. Lastly, no matter how well you perform your job, how dedicated you have been, and how much revenue you have brought the company, in the end you are just being a 'seat filler'. They will do nothing to try and keep you if you decide to leave. HR and upper management are intertwined. What one wants the other wants. Always remember, HR is not the friend of the employee. They are paid by the company and out in place to protect the company. I saw many things happen where HR did not take something seriously or just brushed it under the rug.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

EQR Employees are treated the same as the residents- REPLACEABLE,3.0,"Nov 27, 2009","Steady and dependable pay/benefits. Making friends with co-workers is a given. Equity has or had a very good culture of employees across the nation feeling as though you belong to a family. Creating relationships with residents is really what gets the field employees though the day. Reaching out to your co-workers who are in your same position is often helpful with sharing practices, procedures, and policies. Equity does try to calm the storms with parties for the employees and nice day long meetings for the entire region to get together.","Equity Residential is extremely cheap. Often times major issues with the communities are not fixed or resolved until the situation or issues become dramatically out of control. In this area they have cut cleaning contracts for the majority of the garden style communties leaving the staff to do the dirty work. Properties are not very well maintained, those being renovated are cheaply done and results of poor, cheap products and wokmaship are evident to the customers. Equity does a great job of trying to create job growth by purchasing additional properties but don't expect to transfer or be promoted if you're not in the right circle or know the inside of the very apparent politics.And if you do get promoted, don't expect any training from your direct supervisor, promotions are sink or swim as far as meeting the job requirements. This area is very cliquey, there is definately a seperation between the corporate eployees and field employees. As far as resident retention, they are only a valuable as the rent they pay. The older properties make it quite difficult for people to be proud of where they live, crime, stuctural issues, uncaring and ""robotic"" staff are becoming more of the trend even at the ""luxury"" communities.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Honest Review. Don’t do this to yourself.,1.0,"Dec 7, 2021",The day to day people you work with can be wonderful. Getting to work in the city and the benefit of having a discount on a rental was really nice in such an expensive area.,"COVID brought out the very worst in people and it really took a beating on overall income coming from a business standpoint. EQR is only different in that it seemed to be on a larger scale of driving knives into others backs in this sense. Top tier corporate employees got to work from home but mandated that we had to come into the office every day. This isn’t something new in businesses but pushing to get open during the middle of a pandemic because everyone else is doing it isn’t the sort of “innovation” that puts their workers at the forefront of their thinking. You get rewarded for your hard work with even more work from downsizing which they were dishonest about from the very beginning. Don’t ever think that podding several communities together is “not downsizing”. They try to spin this as a good thing because they are experimenting and other rental properties are doing it. Again, this is not innovation, it is putting more stress on the backs of their loyal workers who have pleaded for more help and instead get rewarded by downsizing. Managers are strained to the point they are taking it to their leasing consultants to do better work while not taking overtime. this leads to work being done off the clock to save your job. Corporate calls this “efficiency”, everyone else will call it responsibilities that don’t correlate to the jobs pay scale. This was once a great company that I was proud to work for, now it has gone to pleasing their stockholders (which they are very open about talking to as a positive point) and moral has never been lower. They also recently got to letting go a whole bunch of people. Benefits are dwindling (discounts are now “industry standard” when it used to be much better than the industry), morale is low and the only thing stringing along the rest of the workforce at EQR is finding the next thing. Don’t consider this a career if you get hired, they will fire you for no reason other than not liking you.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Expect cuts from coffee to post-its in the office. Expect lots of phone calls from unqualified employess who have been hooked up with great titles to call you for help cause they dont have a clue what they are doing. Also, expect lots of pressue and stress from upper management. Do not expect your personal life to be the same. You will be working longer hours then required to do more work then required for trash pay.. and do not expect a penny of overtime. If you are a new employee.. equity does not pay for any training until about 6 months to a year after you have started.

Over Worked Underpaid,1.0,"Apr 17, 2022",I’m not trying to be funny but honestly nothing. The discount is a joke.,"The amount of exploitation that happens in this job in every single department, except of course for the ones all the way up in management, should be looked at and addressed asap before they lose more employees. We get over worked and severely underpaid and are somehow expected to keep going, I don’t think so. I’m surprised that the reviews on here are not as low as it should be. But then again they ask current employees to leave good reviews on here which you shouldn’t be trying to coerce us to do anything. They also asked us through email and in a nationwide meeting to vote on a bill in a certain way to benefit the business which is for sure illegal. Anytime we go to speak up or “question authority” one of our 10 ways you are automatically put under a microscope and get gaslit to think you are in the wrong for questioning them. They constantly tell us not to go over ten minutes of overtime but given the workload often times it is unavoidable. I’m seeing so many employees running on empty and little to no action being done to help us. Instead of solving the existing issues management finds a temporary solution, if you could even call it that, which causes more issues since they were never solved. They only started to actually “care” about diversity and inclusion in 2020 when this has been poorly handled historically and has just been poorly executed virtue signaling. Shame on all of you. There are no incentives as far as discounts go. They cut the already low discount we get on units and this happened during the pandemic. Speaking of the pandemic nothing was done to help except masks being provided since we still were expected to come into work even though almost all of our work can be done remotely. They always mention valuing their employees but it’s just lip service and no actual actions showing this. Training is a joke.

No Decision-Making Authority on-site: There is no autonomy given to Property Managers, day to day resident relation decisions and account decisions must be approved at HQ, Regional and VP level, making decision making embarrasingly slow and held up with red tape. (for example adding a simple parking charge) There is a huge level of distrust between Snr. Management and properties resulting in an archaic style of micromanagement and resentment amongst property staff. Bad Reputation in the Industry: Recruitment Agents have told me working for Equity is a bad mark on your resume because of how they operate. Renowned for being a cheap company, terrible customer service, focused on cutting costs, and imposing hidden costs on Residents. As a publically traded company Equity makes no attempt to hide the fact that its prime focus is on the shareholders and chairman of Equity. Just google 'Forbes interview Sam Zell Grave Dancer' - where our Chairman boasts about dancing on other peoples mistakes and profiting from it - this article was internally promoted and applauded and is a true reflection of the company culture and management style.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

Steer clear . . . There are many better property management companies out there.,1.0,"Feb 11, 2015","Unfortunately, I have nothing to add to this category. Work here if you can't find a job anywhere else.","Equity Residential's cons originate from the top down. The first thing you need to know is this, one group of people matters. No, it's not the residents/paying customers, it's not the employees, it is the shareholders and the shareholders alone. Working for this company was torture because they tell you one thing, then do another. They teach you in their training classes to ""do the right thing"". What is important to know is they left out the second part of their sentence, which is ""do the right thing for the shareholders."" Let me elaborate - At EQR, do not expect one team lunch, a birthday cake, or a reward lunch for a job well done for your team. They won't spend the money. You are not worth it. Do not expect a competitive salary. They spend a lot of time researching the least they can possibly pay you within your market. Good luck getting any more than that for any reason. They also fee residents to death any way they possibly can without shame, while at the same time they try to cut back on the amenities they offer the residents. This makes your job there miserable when you want to do the right thing to help residents in any way possible, but they simply won't allow it. Their benefits are also not as good as other companies. Overall, I would steer clear of both working for this company, or living at one of their communities.",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm
Left the company and CAME BACK!,5.0,"May 18, 2019",The connection between employees is like a family. I left the company to move states and came back to open arms.,"Living in the city is expensive.

Corporate does not care about you,1.0,"May 21, 2020","About 80% of the people on the field are fine to work with. Rent discount. 401k. Health Insurance and other benefits. Employment during pandemic. Some may consider this a pro, apparently it's really difficult to get fired. If you end up with a problematic co-worker, good luck. It seems almost impossible to get fired.","The rent discount is less now. You will barely be able to afford the cost of living at their properties with their pay and discount as a Service Technician or Leasing Consultant. The health insurance options suck. There are plenty of friendly residents, but some are just nasty. Only 3 uniforms a year. Equity only cares about their investors opinions, not yours or the residents or anyone that actually knows what's going on on their properties. They are as cheap as possible. They expect you and your team to give luxury service to residents, but they don't invest in what it takes to maintain that luxury experience. They are making service and leasing teams smaller despite (pre pandemic) seeing growth in profits annually. They will stretch you and your team thin and expect you to carry out unrealistic loads of work. Work life balance is horrendous. Taking time off, vacations, personal days, or sick days just means way more work for you when you get back as the teams are too small to take on the added pressure. I signed up to work on one property and ended up working at four for on call emergencies. There is definite favoritism between the RMs. They put on a friendly front and give the minimum amount of appreciation to keep you in line, but it's all a facade. If you pay just a little bit of attention you'll see they care about money over their employees. Their ethics are questionable. They cut security without informing any residents. They have signs everywhere that they have CCTV cameras, but they don't work at many properties. You can work in Los Angeles or New York, but someone in Chicago will decide that your property no longer needs security and your team will have to be the one to explain to residents that there's no security or footage of their car break in. Goodluck with HR dealing with problematic co-workers. They demand excellence, but there seems to be no repercussions for incompetent workers. If you are sexually harrassed and no longer feel comfortable working alone and report it to HR, they will give give you a false solution and never follow through with it. The pay in my opinion isn't worth it for how miserable the job really is. They encourage their employees to write to politicians or vote certain ways for the company's benefit. During the pandemic: Their number one goal, per the VP, was to collect as much rent as possible, not protect their employees or residents. They will take your questions to ""address"" concerns, but they already have a scripted response to your concerns and won't change their stance and in some cases they flat out ignore difficult questions. No hazard pay. Hardly any protection. They did cut hours TEMPORARILY, everything is back in full swing now, while this pandemic is still happening.

Would not Recommend to a Friend or a Foe,1.0,"Dec 7, 2022","Working for Equity Residential was such a terrible experience, it has made me much more grateful now that I no longer work there.","I began in 2019 under very poor leadership. The regional manager was known to be difficult to work with, play favorites, and was critical of the work ethic of people of color in particular. This individual would make said employees so uncomfortable they would quit, or get so upset they would verbalize this to said regional manager who would then make a point to write them up as often as possible, and then fire them. This regional manager also made a point to make it very clear that the ""luxury"", and very large building I was assigned to work at was being run by a General Manager they planned to fire since he was clearly unequipped for the job. Noting Equity was aware he was not fit for the role, and ultimately firing him in the previously stated process above. During the COVID19 pandemic, leasing managers and other onsite staff were advised to continue business as usual, without providing PPE. Additionally, we had no running water in the only employee bathroom, we additionally did not have soap for so long myself and others would bring our own soap from home. All while being paid $22 per hour pre tax. The working conditions were truly atrocious. Once health concerns were expressed, this regional manager quite literally put myself and other individuals on a watch list for expressing our concerns for our lives. I personally got COVID19 three times during my 1.5 years working there. This regional manager told myself and others we were being lazy by not wanting to do one on one tours in broken elevators with prospective renters, without PPE, and without the ability to wash our hands. This impacted my mental and physical health. If you happen upon any of their buildings yelp or google reviews; you'll note that 90% of them are very negative, expressing hateful feedback to onsite employees. Unfortunately what the tenants do not know or fail to realize is the onsite employees have NO control to improve their experience, and instead act as punching bags for residents to express their frustrations as corporate leadership refuses to take feedback onboard. Furthermore if an employee does raise a concern, they should already be prepared to find another job as they will be fired. Tenants complain onsite employees do not care, however onsite employees have no input over the building budget. Onsite employees do not have control over the 40% rent increases (I have seen up to a 60% increase) they are forced to present to tenants. Tenants do not understand the reason there is such high turnover, dirty common spaces, no lifeguards for pools, 3 out of 4 elevators down daily, unkept gym equipment, frequent building floods, no lighting in the hallways or the emergency stairwells, is the result of Equity and the corporate ""leadership"" that quite literally disregards the health, and lives of their employees as well as their tenants. Onsite employees are cursed out, belittled, threatened, and pushed to their breaking points everyday, because those in the leadership positions to make REAL change refuse to do so. Myself and another female employee were sexually harassed by another onsite employee who arrived to work drunk. He touched us against our will, and we had to lock ourselves in the bathroom as we waited for help. Please note we had to follow up with the regional manager TWICE for a report to be filed. The report did nothing, and no one followed up with either of us, or even asked if we were okay. I should also mention when I gave my 10 business day notice I would be leaving the organization, the regional manager mentioned in this post asked me several times where I would be working at, and that anywhere I would go would be the same. Upon refusing to indulge her request, said regional manager advised if I showed up late, or asked to use one of my many remaining sick days they would ensure my future employers were made aware of this, they would not provide a reference for me, and to top it off specifically said ""you will NOT be leaving Equity on good terms, and we will ensure your future employers know"".",Equity Residential,EQR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-Residential-Reviews-E3635.htm

You will not find a faker group of people in any industry. Ever. To call management incompetent would be a massive understatement, and if that's not bad enough, they refuse to be accountable for their nonsensical behavior and blatant lies and errors. Every property manager that I met spent more time gossiping about their residents than doing anything else, which is quite frankly just bad business and morally bankrupt. The work itself is terribly dull and often includes a great deal of busy work. The property managers bark orders with a smile and have you complete utterly pointless tasks just for the sake of them being in charge. I could go on and on. I can't say that these things are true of every location, but I will say this, never trust a company that throws a christmas party and won't even spring for drinks. ($15 for a budweiser at a holiday party? Seriously? That's a good indication of how much they care about their people). What I can say about the company as a whole is that the benefits are terrible. I had to drive 15 miles to get medication because their insurance only works with two pharmacies. You get one week of vacation after 6 months, and you don't get any real vacation until 5 or 6 years. The 401K matching is an utter joke. The incentives are terrible (you will also compete with your manager for commissions, because that makes sense). Very poor benefits.

In the midst of growing pains for a company experiencing great growth and excessive corporate greed,2.0,"Jan 15, 2012","Good benefits, time off. Financial backing to complete projects, have acceptable appearance of locations and maintenance of sites in customer service industry where impressions are important.","There is a lack of understanding of what happens at the apartment property sites. The last year has seen elimination of titles trying to copy similar companies, without understanding each employee's function. Job descriptions or duties did not change, but bonuses and pay were cut. Lack of understanding of PM role (salaried), which causes the company to leak money in the millions. Average salaried employee works 30 hours per week, sometimes less, while most of corporate America usually relies on salaried employees to pick up the slack. With over 10% unemployment in our culture, good replacements cannot be attracted or hired for most positions, as the replacement will be actually running the site at a very modest pay.

Serious,3.0,"Sep 26, 2012",Large company and great communities. They really don't wont to hold on to any community that can't make it. You can make awesome friends along the way .

Offers a constantly evolving environment where you can gain a lot of experience.,I've been with Equity for several years but they are tough. If you don't do what your told and don't do it well then your time is over. Smile and take it. Over the many years and changing technology I feel that Equity has let go of its culture in exchange for metrics. You will notice a new metric on your dashboard at least once a month in some MRI release that can track you in a new way. If they could hook you up to a machine and monitor your bodily functions...they would. Be prepared..getting a promotion is going to be the fight of your life.

However, I have been here for years and a promotion is nowhere in sight, although I am one of the top performers in my region. jEquity is becoming so cheap that it is ridiculous! Cutting jobs here and there and leaving the remaining staff to carry the burden. They put unrealistic goals on us. For instance they would like us to rent 20 apartments in two weeks, but they will not run a special or renovate the apartments. Cheap. It just gets tiring having to persuade people to rent with us.
