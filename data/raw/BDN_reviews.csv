Toxic corporate work environment,1.0,"Sep 29, 2023","Free snacks and drinks every day when in office, lots of Brandywine branded swag, good health benefits, some great people to work with, huge budget for projects.","The work environment at the company is characterized by a pervasive culture of competitiveness, where personal advancement often takes precedence over ethical conduct. Interactions with colleagues are marred by an ulterior motive to extract information that can be later used against individuals. Furthermore, the marketing department is overseen by managers lacking design expertise, leading to a lack of understanding regarding project complexities and time requirements for designers. Employees are unfortunately treated as expendable resources due to the abundance of job applications received. The marketing department witnesses a high turnover rate, except for upper management, who remain insulated from these changes. Attempts to address the excessive workload have been met with dismissive responses, fostering a tense atmosphere in the office. Interpersonal conflicts are rampant within the department, exacerbated by the exclusivity of decision-making among a select few individuals. Until the company acknowledges and acts upon the feedback provided, particularly concerning the need for a manager with a design background who can advocate for the designers, this cycle of high turnover is likely to persist. Unfortunately, the current project manager has not demonstrated the willingness or ability to fulfill this role. Additionally, the company does not prioritize the mental well-being of its employees, focusing primarily on meeting deadlines and discouraging expressions of concern. It is imperative for the company to reevaluate its management approach, fostering a supportive and inclusive environment that values the contributions and mental health of its workforce.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm

This gives employees the opportunity to get a head-start to the holidays, especially if they need to travel.","No clear path to advancing within company. Being a lean real estate company, with low employee turn-over, sometimes it feels as though there's no clear path to taking on leadership roles within company. You more or less have to wait till senior people move on, which does not happen often. If it does happen, it may be at a location that is not convenient.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm
Waspy and Plastic,1.0,"Jul 1, 2020",The office is beautiful and some departments are great.,"In accounting it is a toxic working environment. The workload is unreasonable and you are expected to work late everyday as well as on weekends and while on vacation or leave. Office politics are heavy and so workload is distributed unevenly and they suffer from being severely understaffed. As a result the turnover rate is incredibly high. When things go wrong there is no accountability from management and the blame is often unfairly shifted. There is also a 'firing culture' unlike anything I've ever seen. Anything bad that happens they sweep under the rug and because of the culture people are too afraid to speak up. It really is a nightmare workplace. Steer clear of accounting. There are so many other great places to work in Philadelphia, don't choose this one.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm

As more companies place more emphasis on their employees, this one says they are but they’re not actually doing anything to improve the employee experience.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm
