Toxic Work Enviornment,1.0,"Jan 25, 2023",NETSTREIT's office is in a great building and location.,"NETSTREIT has the most toxic work environment out of anyplace I have worked prior. Most SVP's enjoy degrading their subordinates and lack managerial skills. Work life balance varies from all extremes based on which department you are in. HR fails to maintain professionalism and will report back to SVP's any complaints made against them, which then turn into harassment toward the person who voiced concern.",NETSTREIT,NTST,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/NetSTREIT-Reviews-E4501438.htm
