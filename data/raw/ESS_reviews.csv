Short-Term Thinking at the Top,1.0,"Nov 16, 2025",Kind people working in Property Operations,"My experience at this organization was defined by instability and constant disruption. Strategic direction shifted so frequently that it was difficult to understand what the company truly wanted to achieve. Major structural decisions were rolled out with confidence and then reversed not long after, leaving employees feeling like they were constantly rebuilding their foundation. Department changes, role reshuffling, and reorganizations happened so often that they began to feel like the norm rather than a response to actual business needs. These shifts rarely seemed to solve the challenges employees were facing, and instead added new layers of uncertainty and frustration. A strong push for positivity made it hard to have honest conversations about the impact of all this change. When concerns were raised, the response often emphasized personal resilience rather than addressing the underlying issues causing employee burnout and confusion. Over time, this approach felt more dismissive than supportive. The company talked a lot about growth, but the focus seemed to be on expanding the business rather than building the internal capacity required to support that expansion. In my experience, this led to heavier workloads, diminished work/life balance, and a noticeable strain on the quality of service employees were able to provide. Culturally, there was a clear disconnect between different parts of the organization. Corporate and Property Operations teams didn’t always feel aligned, and feedback from senior leaders often centered more on optics or messaging than on meaningful improvements to work quality. This created an environment that felt polished on the surface but lacked the genuine support employees needed day-to-day to grow and develop. Leadership frequently spoke about continuous improvement, but the endless cycle of restructuring and shifting priorities made it difficult to see any sustained progress. Instead, it created persistent change fatigue that made it hard to stay motivated or feel invested in the direction of the company. Overall, my time there left me feeling worn down and unsupported. The organization’s emphasis on rapid movement and financial outcomes seemed to outweigh the need for clarity, stability, and a healthy culture. Ultimately, the environment became too chaotic and discouraging for me to stay.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Bait and Switch,1.0,"Oct 4, 2025",Cultivating a company in line with Essex’s true company culture and motivations.,"Essex Property Trust presents itself as a place of values and opportunity, but once inside, you quickly realize it is only a carefully crafted illusion. What feels like a promise of growth and community turns into a culture built on fear, silence, and betrayal. Leaders see mistreatment and refuse to act. HR and executives enable toxic behaviors instead of protecting employees. Disciplinary actions are handed out to silence voices rather than to fix real problems. Speaking up comes at the cost of your career, so most people learn to stay quiet and walk on eggshells every day. The focus is not on people but on numbers. Your loyalty, your effort, even years of service mean nothing if it does not serve the bottom line. Watching long-time, dedicated employees walk away is heartbreaking, yet leadership remains unmoved. This is not a company that values its people. It is a place where you are overworked, undervalued, and ultimately sacrificed for appearances.

RUN! ESSEX HATES THIER EMPLOYEES,1.0,"Jun 4, 2025","I would say the benefits, but as I shop other companies in the industry they offer the same IF NOT BETTER!","Let me start off by saying only work for this company if you hate yourself, You love to be over worked, underappreciated and work in a constant state of fear that you won’t have a job because upper management has no idea what they are doing but are so quick to write up people and fire them. You are more of a call center agent than a “leasing agent”. They evaluate you based on inaccurate reports and numbers. They do not care about the customer experience. You have 3 other departments that handle and/or have an impact on your applicants and when things go wrong within those departments and a lease cancel only the leasing agent is held accountable. When brought to management their response is “get more applications to make up for the canceled applicants” Every employee in every department is OVER WORKED AND STRESSED! Essex has “Core values” but really the only thing they stand by is running good employees into the ground and retaliating on those who speak up and call out the favoritism that happens ON ALL LEVELS! Essex is known for letting the higher ups hirer friends from former companies WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS INDUSTRY IS AND HOW IT WORKS. UPPER MANAGEMENT DOESN’T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Horrible Management,1.0,"Jun 30, 2025",Benefits package included in role,"Absolutely no support or empathy from managers. Other employees had to train new hires without extra pay. Managers took PTO whenever they wanted, came in late, left early, but had a problem with anyone else taking a day off, even with emergencies, they have zero empathy. Rules of the company are not explained but expected to be followed and you will be publicly shamed for it as a “reminder” even after one private talk, they’ll bring it up again. Absolutely zero training due to managers’ lack of knowledge themselves — even if you ask them a question, they’ll tell you to ask someone else but have performative proactive “teamwork” in front of their own higher ups. Managers play favorites and create a major toxic environment with the way they gossip nonstop about everyone instead of working, extremely unprofessional. HIGHLY discourage anyone from applying here, they will literally look for issues in you without doing any work themselves. Manager intentionally excludes others and doesn’t maintain professionalism with favorites.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Toxic toxic toxic,1.0,"Jul 4, 2025",Time off. Sick time. Housing discount.,"Where do I even begin? During my time there, I witnessed and experienced so much that I ultimately felt I had no choice but to leave. The environment was extremely toxic—riddled with favoritism and internal politics. Leadership was controlling, and it often felt like decisions were made unilaterally, with no room for collaboration or dissent. If you weren’t in the inner circle, your chances for advancement were slim to none. There were serious instances of unprofessional behavior that went completely unaddressed. One employee, visibly intoxicated at a public event, made an inappropriate comment to a senior team member—and faced no consequences. That same individual continues to receive benefits, including designated housing, despite not holding a position that qualifies for it. Additionally, there were troubling claims about a family member of leadership being fast-tracked for low-income housing. If the City of Santa Clara were made aware, it would raise serious concerns. In the end, I chose to walk away—even from a bonus—because staying simply wasn’t worth the toll it was taking. That should speak volumes.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

The culture has changed,1.0,"May 28, 2025",The benefits and my team,"The culture has shifted immensely since the turnover in our senior leadership. They are asking too much of managers that prevent them from being effective leaders and support for the teams. They have created an operating model with far too many hands in one pot and there is little to no effective communication between departments. There is an emphasis on customer sentiment, but what our customers are asking for is an on-site presence again. And that is the one thing we are not going to do for them. So our operations team continue to fight what feels like a losing battle. There appear to be too many egos involved in decision making and the focus on associate engagement has completely switched to profit, profit, profit.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Toxic Mess,1.0,"Jul 14, 2025","You’ll likely build strong bonds with a few trusted colleagues—the kind of connection that forms when you're both sitting through yet another ""urgent"" coffee talk announcing sweeping changes and silently wondering, Is this normal? That shared glance might just spark a real friendship. This is also a place where you’ll stretch beyond your comfort zone—because you’ll have to. With frequent departures and minimal backfilling, it's common to inherit new responsibilities with little warning or training. The upside? You may uncover strengths or skills you didn’t know you had. The downside? Those added duties rarely come with a raise or the bandwidth to do them well. Still, the experience may serve you down the line, especially if you're looking to build a broader résumé.","The cultural decline has been noticeable—and fast. As the CEO advanced through the organization, the environment shifted dramatically and negatively. Over the past year, turnover has surged at every level, with an unsettling number of long-tenured leaders either quietly “retiring” or being replaced by individuals with little relevant experience. Key roles in operations, HR, and asset management and development have seen abrupt transitions, often filled by candidates whose backgrounds raise questions. A number of experienced people were forced out or left with weird changes at the top; HR leadership shifted from a respected people-first HR head to CAO with minimal change management experience who lacks an understanding of the human element of HR. Operational oversight is murky at best, with no clear leadership—and it shows. Operations leaders continue to disappear in emails described as more ""retirements"" and more operations people in the maintenance and day to day functions have departed or been fired. No one seems to be able to make a decision about how to best serve residents with the strategy in constant flux. In all functions, respected people up and down the corporate ladder keep departing and no one is asking why. Or no one cares to ask why since people know. The resulting instability has triggered a cascade of confusion. Departments are in a constant state of reorganization, institutional knowledge is rapidly disappearing, and employees—both corporate and onsite—are left guessing at basic processes. Communication is fragmented, and getting clear answers often feels like running in circles. Morale has declined sharply, especially among onsite teams who are left to manage resident frustration without adequate support. Longstanding mid-level contributors—the ones who actually understand the work—are leaving, either by choice or force. Meanwhile, decisions appear reactive and disconnected from operational reality. The internal atmosphere is tense. Open dialogue is discouraged, and there’s a widespread fear of speaking up, even over obvious dysfunction. It's a place where silence is the safest strategy and job hunting is a shared undercurrent. Many recent reviews echo the same sentiment: toxic, unstable, and disorienting.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Retaliation,1.0,"Oct 18, 2024",Some team members are great,"Essex has become a place where there is a fear of leadership and speaking up. Instead of feedback being received by managers, you are essentially penalized for giving feedback. They took away “refresh days” due to staff complaining that the workload was too high to ever utilize them. Every manager, except maybe two I’ve encountered, is unprofessional with minimal skills in actually leading a team. Managers are afraid to speak up for their teams due to fear of retaliation from corporate. I’ve had team members break down and cry due to the increased workload. My advice to my coworkers who are struggling is to remember that this is just a job, and there are plenty of other companies that will treat you with respect and value work-life balance. The constant restructures always seem to cut frontline staff. It’s always been about profit, but now it feels like it’s profit over the well-being of seasoned employees. The compensation doesn’t even match the demands of the job. HR will probably respond to these reviews with ChatGPT-generated responses, which shows how little they care.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Used to be a great company,1.0,"Oct 2, 2024",Great benefits and bonus structure.,"As a long-term employee it pains me to write this. Essex use to be a great company but it has dramatically declined over the past year. Essex embodies a dynamic and fast-paced work environment, requiring individuals to excel in multitasking and maintain peak performance. Decision-making is predominantly driven by strong top-down leadership; however, transparency regarding the rationale and anticipated outcomes is limited. The Vice Presidents often operate behind the scenes like the enigmatic figure of Oz, making decisions with limited receptivity to feedback and a tendency to assign blame swiftly in case of setbacks. In recent times, some of the most respected senior leaders have either resigned or been laid off, leaving behind a group of ""yes"" men who now run the show. These individuals often fail to work a full day or take accountability for their actions, yet they excel at talking a good game and maintaining appearances. This shift in leadership has further contributed to the top-down, opaque decision-making culture, creating an environment where genuine leadership and responsibility are increasingly rare.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

They even took away an additional incentive of extra PTO, their reasoning because many couldn't use it BECAUSE they were stressed on workload and taking time off meant things wouldn't get done. Employee housing/parking increases with little to no increase at the end of 2024.

With over two decades of experience in the Property Management industry, I can confidently say that Essex is the company I envision retiring with. Essex's response to the challenges posed by the pandemic was nothing short of exceptional. They prioritized the safety and well-being of their associates through proactive measures, and it didn't stop there. Essex goes above and beyond by offering unique programs to support our physical and mental health, fostering a sense of camaraderie through enjoyable events, and championing diversity and inclusivity. It's not just lip service; they host meetings to celebrate various cultures and have a female Asian CEO, demonstrating true leadership in our industry. No company is without its challenges, but Essex doesn't shy away from them. They actively listen to associates and adapt to market observations. Recent operational changes, while posing initial challenges, have only strengthened my belief that Essex will emerge even stronger. As an African American woman, I'm deeply grateful to be part of an organization that values diversity, safety, and associate well-being. Essex encourages feedback through initiatives like ""Speak Up,"" enhancing engagement and addressing operational issues effectively. Their benefits package, which includes paid days off for mental health and the addition of Juneteenth as a paid holiday, is truly phenomenal. Essex's support during tough economic times, including surprise bonuses for entry-level associates, exemplifies their dedication to their employees. In a world where finding an employer that genuinely cares about its associates can be a rarity, Essex shines brightly as an employer of choice. In conclusion, Essex is not just a company; it's a community that values its people above all else.

Independent Thinkers Need Not Apply,2.0,"Jul 19, 2023","The company has decent benefits. Offers PTO to full-time, hired employees (if you get hired on)","The company has a tendency to use staffing agencies and hold people in the position for an unknown amount of time. Leaving workers without job security as they won’t make you aware ahead of time if they intend to release you from the contract with adequate notice to allow you to find another job. This also means workers are left without the same benefits their contemporaries may have such as leave, PTO, and health benefits. The company also engages in discriminatory practices towards those with disabilities, whether that be physically or mental, towards both employees and their residents causing a number of legal concerns. It should be noted due to extensive disorganized within the corporate sect, the company deeply engages in ‘quiet hiring’ where the job you’re expected to do can change at a moments notice and you are required to learn and take on duties and tasks that were not previously expected of the department. To elaborate, a person in an administrative position may be asked to take on financial bookkeeping tasks with minimal training, support, or pay adjustment. Leadership and management also have a tendency to rely heavily on subordinates to create their own training materials, tools and resources that are necessary for basic job function rather than taking time to create various materials to assist their employees in basic job functions. To which the employee will not receive credit or praise but rather the expectation for more in the future. Management expects subordinates to train new team members while accomplishing the same daily task load without training pay, creating a strained environment for those capable of doing a job well. In short, being capable is treated as a punishment- more will be expected of you without resources being provided to you.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

There is not enough staff. I refuse to believe they can't find people to hire. They just milk their employees and expect the same high level of work output with only 3/5th the staff. They hire and promote people who are related to or are friends with a current employees. Not a huge con but they do this a lot and then end up hiring relatively incompetent/under qualified people.

My property outperforms other properties financially, and I have assisted other communities when there were position vacancies. However, my efforts were not rewarded financially or even with a 'Thank You'. The leasing staff is severely underpaid and the Essex bonus program is a joke compared to its competitors. My regional manager is obviously responsible for multiple communities, which prevents him/her from being able to visit every property weekly. However, my manager hasn't visited my property in 3 months. This means he/she doesn't know what is going on at the community, and he/she doesn't have a pulse on what's needed for the community.

They have a bad rep for a reason!,1.0,"Dec 3, 2015","Good employee housing discount, fun company events, good benefits.","I worked for a short time for BRE before the company was bought out by Essex. Throughout the merge there was slim to no training on the new applications, no support from the Essex team and a HUGE cut in most employees income. I've had a negative experience from the start of the merge with Essex. Unless you're close with someone in the corporate office it's very unlikely that you will get promoted. The pay isn't great because if you go just about anywhere else they will offer you not only more hourly but pay more for commission which is where us leasing consultants actually make our money. The new employees were trained very poorly and had no idea what to do or how to use any applications once on site. They basically spend a day or two with the new hires and then send them out with no knowledge of how to use basic computer applications and no clue how to lease an apartment. Now that I have experienced what it's like to work for a company that actually takes pride in their employees and has training designed to teach and benefit their new employees I realize what a negative experience it was to work for Essex. Also they critique your every move and when you score a great score on a secret shop you receive no recognition nor any incentive. Change isn't always a bad thing but when you're working blindly and have no support from the corporate team it makes it extremely difficult to do your job.

So many fragmented departments and nobody has answers for on site staff so it is almost impossible to genuinely provide efficient customer service. Associates are so overworked, enjoyment in the workplace is non-existent and you can forget about really having the time to build connections with residents because of the never ending deadlines and inefficient systems. Constant turnover because of unhappy employees and it is detrimental to the properties and residents. Upper management is hands off and condescending and pride themselves in ruling through fear. Corporate talks of empowering their onsite staff but really that is code for overworking them. Regional Managers have been witnessed being flat out disrespectful and abrasive to vendors and managers in front of their teams. It's a disorganized and hostile environment that needs to be addressed. For such a high profile company to run this way is shocking.

Our communities are being grouped and staff assigned to manage specific tasks in a larger scale, allowing us to focus on what we are all good at and avoid being pulled in a hundred different directions as the traditional way of managing assets goes. Essex has also taken a great step in upgrading their compensation package. Through Asset Collections, a new pay structure has given us a more lucrative and competitive pay scale that show their appreciation for the employees. In 2022, Essex also pushed their life/work balance model to impressive levels, closing all offices on Sundays, providing us with additional time off, a National Parks Annual Pass and bonuses. Essex is taking pride in being a company driven by employee satisfaction. I welcome anyone to experience the future of Property Management with Essex.","Health insurance coverage has taken a few steps in the wrong direction, with premiums and copays going up.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Properties everywhere Pays bills and keeps up with projects","-They change bonus structure in the middle of the year and most properties arent meeting budgets cause they base it on last year growth.  It's their way of not paying their hard workers. My RPM has the worse reputation among managers. He yells, throws under the bus, and sends mixed signals. He only responds to requests and issue if something his boss cares about.  HR is aware of so many complaints and they do nothing.  I had one of the best managers and I see her dealing with how he treats her. When you leave a RPM like that, you lose money.  No one is motivated to work hard for him.  He had a nice property and no managers that work for Essex want to go there because of him so he has to hire inexperienced only.

Opportunities & Growth: If you put in the effort.,5.0,"Apr 11, 2022","I have worked for Essex for almost 6 years, starting out as an Assistant Community Manager at one of the East Bay Communities. The Essex that I started with has changed considerably and is only slightly recognizable. Generally, that can seem like a bad thing, but instead, it shows that we change with time, feedback, and what associates and residents are expecting. The changes can sometimes be slow, and sometimes they happen at a breakneck speed - but they allow for each associate to develop new skills and provide better working environments, tools, and employee/prospect/resident experiences. If you adapt, learn, and grow - you will see that you are provided with more opportunities and challenges. Throughout all the years at Essex, one thing remains absolute - there is always help and support.","As mentioned above - some changes happen slowly or quickly, and sometimes the changes can have an awkward acclimation period. Back-end departments are working on making rollouts less cumbersome, but just do what you can as you can. Some of the opportunities that came up were sometimes opportunities that should have had a larger compensation package tied to them, but over the years that has seemed to dissapate as an issue.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Huge advice, if you are daring to processed and accept employment with Essex; KEEP A JOURNAL at all times, with accurate dates, records, and anything that you know is not right and you will witness how wrong the company is from the very beginning.

If you apply for a promotion, you will always get an interview even if you aren't quite ready for the position. If you tell your supervisor that you want to grow and learn, they will help you in any way that they can. Every region operates as a team and it is a true joy to work with my colleagues.","Sometimes I wish there were more robust training programs at our disposal, specifically Section 8, BMR, Rent Control training, etc. However, even though there are not many corporate sanctioned training programs in this area - if you ever have any questions, there is always another associate somewhere who is willing and able to help you out.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Profit over Employees,2.0,"Jan 18, 2020","Benefits (Healthcare, 401k Match, FSA Plan and Housing Discounts)","* Overworked, underpaid and undervalued. * High Turnover Rate adds additional stress to employees who are already spread thin. * Minimal support from upper management. The support that is received - is often ill-informed and lacks logic. * Unrealistic directives & new policies/procedures are constantly handed down from Corporate employees who have never worked on site - with no regard or input from the on-site team. * 3% Annual Merit increases - even for top performers. Hourly/Salary rates do not keep up with the cost of living nor industry standards. * As of late, ""Company culture"" is non-existent and only focused on profits and revenue. As a result - employee morale has tanked, causing everyone from Area Managers to Leasing Agents to look for better opportunities.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Move Up Fast!,5.0,"Jun 8, 2020","In my almost three years here at Essex, I have been very fortunate to experience a great supportive system and a lot of opportunity to move up within the company. Essex is all about promoting within once you are hired. You can get promoted within 6 months, which is pretty quick . The resources provided are vast and easily accessible for any employee. Essex is very much about making sure their employees are properly trained and supported by their fellow colleagues to succeed. Plus there is a great PTO program and medical/dental/retirement options for all employees.",Nothing I can really think of at this time.,"Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

The metrics for advancement often change or are unclear due to high turnover in upper management, and/or constantly changing review processes. 2.

Poor Management and HR,1.0,"Dec 14, 2021","Essex prides themselves on being a place where associates can feel safe to make mistakes, since they don't pay well.

"Dissapointed, sad and exhausted",2.0,"Sep 12, 2022",- Vitality/health programs - My immediate/in office and maintenance teams - Guidance and care that has been personally given to me by direct managers/supervisors in a genuine effort to help me grow to my desired positions,"- ASSET COLLECTIONS: This is the absolute worst thing this company has done in my 8+ years here. It was rolled out faster than initially announced with very little information about positions before being forced into taking one. This is very scary for people who have worked somewhere for a long time and worked hard for their promotions. Essex prides themselves on taking our feedback into consideration and proactively tweaking things as we go but none of it is true. Your on-site/Community Relations teams are exhausted and burnt out and our complains seem to fall on deaf ears. During our last corporate update ""coffee talk"", there was an entire segment about how most of the feedback on Asset Collections was positive. It's just not true. The split of duties vs. available staff between the leasing teams and community relations teams was not even. On-site teams are still doing 70% of the work, while leasing teams are basically glorified call centers. Leasing is never expected to be on a property even though checking their product, touring, etc. should certainly fall under leasing duties. Our community relations team was asked today to have someone from OUR team on-site to greet tours and show them to the apartments because of high ATR. At this point, we are also leasing/touring apartments? Why do we have a leasing team? How can we do everything? The request was a serious slap in the face considering how much our teams have had to endure. I used to have a staff of 3 + myself for a 400 unit property, now I have a staff of 2 + myself for 1100+ units on 4 properties. The math doesn't add up. To add insult to injury, the leasing agents are being paid more per hour + $100 per lease. Community relations reps are being paid less per hour and their opportunity for commission (transfers and renewals) have been stripped. As a manager who is now overseeing almost three times as many units, my ""increase"" was absolutely not reflective of the additional work expected. What is the incentive to work in these conditions? I am sad and frustrated. I have never seen so many people leave a company so fast. Pay attention to who is leaving. You have seasoned employees/managers/supervisors/upper management jumping ship. This doesn't look good. It doesn't instill confidence. Please know that your employee's loyalty is wavering.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Make sure your onsite management knows their processes,2.0,"Feb 6, 2015",Beautiful properties that they don't hesitate to spend money on. Centrally located. Lots of properties so a lot of opportunity for growth.,"Unorganized property processes. For a company this big, the directive needs to be clear and consistent. My training was lackluster because my manager was lackluster. She did not know company processes, and as a relatively new employee I struggled to get reliable, consistent information. I was told to reach out to strangers, other managers, most not in my region, to find answers to my questions; but if you know what it is to be a manager, you know sometimes, you just don't have time to answer other people's questions so the dynamic of me having to find answers to pertinent, legal based questions through harassing other people was awkward to me. The company is not focussed on the dynamics onsite, which leads to a different experience from property to property. I was unable, due to the strange and overly competitive dynamic onsite, to rely on my subordinates to execute delegated tasks reliably. This is an important aspect of property management in my opinion; teamwork. I was terminated when they were fully aware I had no appropriate training, due to the fact that the pm who hired me went out on maternity leave less than two weeks after I started (I wasn't aware she was pregnant and would've stayed at the A+ property I was at prior to working for Essex if I wouldve known I was walking into a shaky management situation) and the woman they decided to place as temp PM did not have any idea of what she was doing- she couldn't/wouldn't post money, create notices or speak to residents and the staff onsite and residents truly disliked her. It is unfortunate, because I recognise I would have been an asset to the company if I would have worked with my original manager or have received the proper training.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Areas of improvement,3.0,"Sep 17, 2018",The company is a growing company. They are very flexible when it comes to needing time off. They really care for the residents. The company does try to do things for employees like events.,"The company does not train their employees at all. Essex has leasing agents go through one course at the start of their time with them. Essex for some reason thinks this is sufficient training for employees. Which is unacceptable. Maintenance is never trained on how to manage their time, admin, customer service, team work and so much more. But yet Essex wonders why they can't find or keep maintenance. They don't train assistant managers properly. Yeah it is great that they train them on process but they don't ever train them on time management, leadership, customer service, conflict resolution and so much more. I hear a lot in this company that they don't favor people or gossip and then those same people turn around and do that exact thing. They say they have standards but what I see is it is a free for all. Employees are promoted when they are not ready. They are promoted based off who they know not what value they bring the company. I have seen managers live on property and do things that we wouldn't allow residents to do but for some reason we don't hold employees to a hire standard. The company integrity is not were it should be. I have seen them roll out challenges but in the end didn't full fill on giving out the prize due to their lack of preparations. Managers need to be trained on what it means to be leader. I have only saw a few managers in the company that I would consider leaders.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

This is not a problem unique to working for Essex though, but consider it if you want to work for them. They do offer a rent reduction if you live on site but you are than expected to be available as first responders in an emergency. The older properties they have inherited in the Seattle area have been poorly maintained and remodeled so there is a very high volume of work orders which is increased by the damage the residents inflict on the property themselves. They also have many section 8 people living on site receiving rent subsidies and there is a strong correlation between sec8 and damage to the property/units along with higher criminal behavior and mental illness.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

He acknowledges your presence and is just overall amazing. I love my team and their spunky energy. The office is beautiful, well maintained, with great vendors to be there on the spot when you request them. There's coffee bars in every corner to keep you going throughout the day, they'll even stock the ladies room with feminine napkins. There's refrigerators to store your lunch, microwaves, and toaster ovens too. Friendly & Genuine staff, for the most part. Everyone is your friend wherever you turn. Everyone loves everyone (at least that's what it mostly feels like). We are a family. Easy going vibe. Sometimes you'll see an executive in their gym clothes with a handful paperwork, so you know it's a health inspired environment. Did I mention, there's also a little gym as an added amenity to burn off that extra energy on your break or lunch? There's even a mommy room too! There are copy rooms in each area so work flow maintains a steady pace. If you seek help, everyone always extends a helping hand so you'll never fall behind. There's a strong support in team effort on that part. You will NEVER get a cold shoulder turned on you. There's an open door policy, so you can literally walk up to your executive, director, or manager for anything. I have a strong support from my direct manager also, she's terrific and I love her so much. Paid Holidays and Benefits are a plus. There's monthly events that bring the team together, so that's nice also. There is a cash perk for recruiting friends. You get commission if you work onsite. Company major gatherings are held a couple times a year, so that's nice also for mingling and building your network. I love my job. I love my job-I LOVE MY JOB! I have made the best of friends here and enjoy working with them and being in their presence. I actually go to work, SO excited to go.","Dental plan is really bad...but you can choose between Kaiser or your own health provider. While considerably our apartments are the best in the market, the customer care turnaround response time is quite terrible to be honest. People these days are not patient to wait 48 hours until their questions are answered, where they expect an answer right then and there...and that isn't the case here. We forward them to an automated voicemail system...which is unheard of in the customer service industry alone. You can call anywhere and at least someone will pickup the phone and help you, you may be transferred a gazillion times, but at least you'll be transferred to a live person. We're a lot slower to progression than most companies out there so expect a delay when you want something done to help the company expand and grow, or even if you're expecting a review for something such as a raise and for that to actually take place or happen at all. You want a raise? Expect a year and a half for it to keep being pushed out because they're ""too busy"" to consider your request to really embark in your career. It doesn't matter how much you love it here, or what position you're in. That's just the sad truth. Know your market before coming in and be ready for .......an......extended..........delay.......to your requests, whatever it may be. It's not about what you know-but who you know. HR has a big pull from Executives, so if you have an issue with them, or their admin below them... expect that they will not get written up for their hostility towards you and they will literally get away with anything no matter how bad. It will be brushed off as if nothing happened, not even a warning or write-up. It's the nature here, so the best thing is to stay to yourself and bite your tongue when a snarky remark or comment is thrown at you. Speak up in confidentiality, it won't stay confidential, and whoever you speak up about will find out somehow, retaliate against you and make your life a living hell...and of course, get away with it while they're at it. Quit...and you let them win. Will it get better if you leave? No, because that horrible person will still be there...just because of WHO they are representing and working directly under. And you can't choose not to work with them nor can you avoid them either because they'll find a way to get in the mix of YOUR job too. Yes hostility exists here and there is no practice of justice for it, that's how weak our HR system is. Think of it as a mirage. That's what it can feel like at times. You just have to make the best of it on your own. I probably made this sound like a terrible place to work, and I'm sorry if you're considering a position here. In honesty, it is a great place and environment, just certain people can make it extremely difficult. So if it happens to you, that you're the chosen one to be bullied, know that you're not alone and you're not a pushover-It's everywhere, I presume. And though write-ups aren't quite a thing here and there actually is a high tolerance for promoting bad behavior (even though when you sign your contract it says there's a zero tolerance for it), you are actually supported from your direct manager...and they will lookout for your general well-being...even speak up on your behalf. So there's that. Is that the greatest solution? No. But it does help ease the tension to have a friend on your side and actually be your manager. It can be cut throat, because EVERYONE is passionate about their job and position they hold, so there will be butting heads, a lot actually, but if you are mentally strong and don't let harsh words hurt you or bring you down, you'll succeed and get ahead. Call it a love-hate relationship. Where you hate the people you work with (of course not everyone) so much that you love them because in the end, you realize we're all family. We don't just work with each other...you spend an entire day with each other spending more time with colleagues moreso your actual real family at home. So yes, the reality hits the fan from time to time. You've got to decide how you're going to take it and handle it and choose if this is the place that's for you. If it is-great. More power to you coming in to know what to expect. If not, don't worry-It's not for everyone, just putting it out there to give you a perspective of the real work environment at ESSEX.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Grow you career with Essex,5.0,"Nov 5, 2020","Essex seeks associates that WANT to grow their careers. I have been with the company for 9.5 years, I started from the ""bottom"" as an entry level Leasing Associate and grew my career to be a Multi-Site Community Manager. Effort and hard work is rewarded in this organization and that's visible in the number of current associates who have been part of the Essex Family for 10+ years in a variety of roles.","It's impossible to make everyone happy all of the time, but I can not think of any fundamental cons with Essex.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Boost morale for site teams. A webinar doesn't work to achieve happy site teams. We are exhausted.,4.0,"Sep 29, 2021",They keep us really safe in COVID times. Feel supported by RPM and DV leadership. They change what doesn't work (eventually). Great housing discount program. Great benefits. Long term associates. Strive to be professional and transparent organization.,"They have many understaffed properties, and over stressed associates. (Like most companies) They offer webinars but that is not the answer. Give more financial incentives instead! $200 bucks just because would go over way better than some speaker when you have no time to join those calls. Many priorities and not enough morale boosting for the teams. No picnic, no holiday parties, and forget some $50 giftcard for Thanksgiving that's insulting. We miss seeing our sister property friends and coworkers and feel isolated. When coffee talk shares all these millions you're spending but we are barely making ends meet, doing 3 jobs with one same salary, its a huge demotivator. Consider an escalated pay to those who are understaffed so they know they are appreciated. It's counter intuitive to give a signing bonus to new maintenance guy but the existing is working for the same pay with no help for that long with no financial appreciation and high stress causes burn out. Consider allowing CMs to get healthy snacks fruit and drinks in a fridge for the teams to stay hydrated and nourished. Keep it stocked! Most of us power through the day like zombies nowadays. There's never any money for something like that. No control over your budget process too, is weird. Not even to review it? Many corporate departments are out of touch with the true site level experience. They try but fail. We are exhausted! Residents and customers yell at us and treat us so badly. We take the brunt of their problems, and we have our own. We are trying so hard to do a good job and we get hit with negative reviews that are unsubstantiated but they affect our raises and performance evaluations. Poor CMS oversight, should do an anonymous survey to get more insight on where training is needed for those employees. Revamp the renewal process. Revenue Management is so disconnected on how hard it is to renew residents with these types of rent increases. They insult the customer and are unreasonable. It is nuts to raise 15% without considering these reoccurring concession burn offs. My goodness some people are receiving like 30% out of pocket increases plus rentable items that were concessed. How can you put that pressure on the leasing teams to sell that to an expiring tenant? We are laughed at and told that it crazy. It's understandable to raise these rents. Specials were crazy last year. But its out of touch to have the teams constantly go back and forth with deviations when they should be evaluated properly in the start.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
"Amazing benefits, caring culture, and a company that tries.",4.0,"Jun 10, 2022","Full health, dental, vision, and life insurance at a modest contribution from employees, along with 401k plans and awesome matching options. Flexible work from home schedules for corporate employees, and lots of PTO given. The company's culture is one of caring. No corporate entity is perfect, but Essex at least tries. Diversity Equity and Inclusivity is a huge component of the company, and everyone (from entry level to senior leadership) is encouraged to participate in the various LGBTQ+, Women, and other affinity/employee resource groups. Fair hourly and salary ranges, opportunities for overtime and part time, depending on the employee's availability and needs.","The biggest Cons I've seen are 1) the need for more transparency - there have been a lot of changes to the structure of the company recently (all of which I think are positive changes are will only bring good) but with those changes it seemed that information was given out slowly and in pieces. I understand not wanting to say one thing and having to take it back later, or not wanting to stress the teams out too much, but I think most people feel they are adults and can handle change so long as they are kept very closely informed. 2) The need for standardization (which some of the changes being implemented should help with). Some offices feel like they are for a completely different company, and do not share the same values and care that Essex as a whole seems to.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Good environment but need to balance workload and compensation.,3.0,"Nov 9, 2022",Close knit teams with good support from local/direct supervisors. Good ideas with advancements in tech. Expanding and improving on work/life balance and improving benefits.,"Clear paths for advancement have become murky and harder to attain. Only a limited number of management positions in a region from what was originally one at every community give or take multi sites. Seeing others with less experience in the industry and company promoted over others with clearer knowledge and experience. Rollouts for the new tech are not thoroughly tested or piloted before expanding to the rest of the company. Workload has been increased to balance multiple communities without a proper raise in compensation regardless of not touring and leasing. Sales are paid almost the same as Community Relations plus commission. While sales have an increased workload as well, a lot of mistakes are missed and passed on for Community Relations to address. There needs to be more thorough training for sales and even for Community Relations. 1 Portfolio Sales Manager can not train a new sales team member on 10 properties and still do their regular tasks. Feedback to upper management is escalated but not followed up on or no fixes are presented. Upper management needs a more in depth look at what their on site teams are dealing with on a regular basis. We pride ourselves on customer service but are having trouble keeping up with communications as they come in. This leaves us unable to do anything to really excel and stand out with our customer service by just staying afloat. Affordable Housing Programs are never considered when rolling out new initiatives.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

It's bad. Real bad.,1.0,"Apr 29, 2016",Some of the employees are really good and care about what they do.,"This is not a good company. I could share with you dozens of stories that I’ve experienced personally in my few years, but I know you don’t want to read a novel. So here are a few choice anecdotes you might find helpful: -An employee was fired for sending all our W2 information to a cybercriminal. Definitely not a good thing, but she was an entry-level payroll girl with less than a year of experience. Good to know Essex would fire me if I made a mistake I hadn’t been trained to avoid. (They did give me a year of identity theft protection, which I simply added to the subscription they gave me the last time my info was stolen. Guess this happens here every few years or so?) -This is a boys club. It's disgusting. I've personally witnessed behavior I felt obliged to report but was begged not to by the female victim, who was genuinely worried she'd lose her job. I won't go into the details in this review because you probably won't believe me. Play it safe and avoid any parties/gatherings where there is booze (Maybe this is the right place for you if you’re a gross guy?) -So many employees in corporate are miserable. Even VP’s openly talk about it with each other and their subordinates. Even if your job and team are great, if everyone around you is miserable, you’ll start to get dragged down too. I did. -HR employees don’t have tight lips and will share some serious scandalous stories with you, like which senior level employee is doing something a normal employee would get fired for. Won’t go into the details, but again – disgusting. (And yes, that senior level person is still there.) How demoralizing. -Leadership does nothing. Well, okay – that’s not true. They’ve pushed out most of the only remaining charismatic and caring VPs at the company, then offer you way too many details about why they weren’t good fits. I don’t know if the execs don’t know how bad it is or if they don’t care. Oh, they say they care and want to change things – they’ve been saying that for years. And things are just as bad today as they were back then. I think they want to make it better but are in denial about how bad it is. tl;dr You might get fired for making a mistake you don’t know how to avoid, your personal info may get stolen more than once, you might get harassed, HR may gossip about you, your coworkers will be miserable and the heads of the company are clueless. This company makes a lot of money, and they always celebrate how they are “winning.” But if you want more than that and you have options, please go somewhere else. I am soon, and I can’t wait. P.S. The director of culture they used to have responding to these reviews abruptly left earlier this year, and they aren’t looking for a replacement.

Why I fired Essex,1.0,"Mar 20, 2018",Company offers a full benefits package,"I discovered early on that instead of hiring onto a well-oiled property management team that I was in a rusty bucket of bolts with little hopes of receiving the leadership that would change my daily reality working on a dysfunctional team. It felt like being put on a football team where some of the players didn’t wear their uniforms, show up to practice, or play by the rules – and then be told to form a winning team with them! My daily work life was like being held captive in a dungeon by a mean ogre. I saw no management skills in dealing with immature employees who need to be instructed in how to be adult workers who show up on time (and on the days they are scheduled to work!), in company attire, and who work their shift without extended breaks, pilfering company time by visiting Facebook, or regular half-hour stints in the bathroom. I appealed to upper management to make a move to another property but was directed to attempt to work things out where I was. I did make an attempt but the results at trying to create a meaningful dialog was like pushing wet spaghetti. That's when I lost hope and began an earnest job search. The initial couple of days of training at corporate are a great start. At the property, there was no clearly defined sequence of training, it is all on the fly and not oriented around best training practices (watch me do it, do it while I watch you, do it by yourself). Fellow workers are generally too busy to provide training. Instead of focused step-by-step instructions, it's demand-based help, lots of How-do-I-do questions. This situation is a glaring weakness at the property.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

Hard work and honesty are mistaken for stupidity. Kindness is a weakness to these people.

Horrible Dictatorship,1.0,"Nov 22, 2022",The associates are far best the most amazing part of Essex. Hardworking individuals that have hearts of gold.,"Upper level leadership are so out of touch with their associates. Only cares for their agenda at whatever costs. During my short stint with Essex, it was apparent to me this company wasn't a fit for me. I left a company for an amazing opportunity that unfortunately was made up of smoke and mirrors. Upper level leadership was aggressive and demeaning on how they would speak to us. The company felt as if it was being run by a tyrant versus a leader. They don't value opinions of others nor do they want to hear them. Essex has a monthly platform where leadership speaks to the entire company. Disseminating updates and information to the teams. The platform (zoom) has a chat window where associates once were able to ask questions and share comments and concerns. Tension with associates have grown due to their frustration with the ""asset collection"" staffing model. Upper level leadership turned off the chat feature in the middle of a call - eliminating our teams voices and allowing for transparency. They stated it was due to technical difficulties, however the teams knew why they did it. To silence them and to eliminate their voices. Since that call, they have kept the feature off. Essex has changed their staffing model. The concept sounds great, however the execution was poorly done, rushed and not thought through. Associates were asked to accept positions without job descriptions for their new roles. It felt like bait and switch. Several locations are so understaffed and overworked. When bringing these challenges to upper level leadership, they were shot down with no ounce of consideration. Just a statement of your teams are focused on the things.

STAY AWAY!- Toxic Culture,1.0,"Mar 19, 2021",Essex has an amazing portfolio of assets and offers competitive salaries and benefits to other publicly-traded REITs.,"As leadership changes occurred over the years, the culture changed. During the last 2 years of my employment, I endured multiple incidents of harassment from my supervisor. She made inappropriate comments about my physical attractiveness and that of my spouse and disparaged our relationship. She made these insulting comments on multiple occasions and in the presence of peers and other leaders. Prefacing comments with “No offense, but..” confirms that she knew the comments were unprofessional, offensive, and inappropriate but decided to say them anyway to humiliate or embarrass me in front of colleagues. Had I made a similar comment to any associate in the organization, I would have been disciplined and likely fired. Another example of the culture shift and lack of care and common decency that leadership has for its employees occurred when an associate unexpectedly passed away. When notified of the loss, regional leadership showed little concern for the team or the employee's family, but the initial response was to make sure the Community Manager submitted the requisition to start recruiting for the open position. While we all can agree that the business needs will always be a priority, the lack of compassion illustrates how little regard there is for associates. The final incidents that cemented my decision to leave the company occurred a few weeks into the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Executive Leadership would host an all associate Zoom meeting each week to provide updates and guidance. During one of those meetings, all onsite leasing associates were threatened with disciplinary action and termination if they were not able to maintain leasing activity. Keep in mind that stay-at-home orders were in effect, unemployment was at an all-time high, and people were fearful for their health and safety, and not out shopping for apartments. Many members of my team and others expressed their concerns after that meeting. On another all associate Zoom call, it was announced that the other REITs beat Essex handily during the prior quarter and used employee safety as the reason for Essex’s performance. Not only was that demoralizing for associates to hear they were being blamed, but it revealed the truth that the culture in Essex turned to CYA. Senior leaders down to regional leaders will not own their poor decisions, but rather blame and seek to punish those who were putting themselves at risk to execute their plan. It was at that moment that I realized how toxic the culture is at Essex. Toxic from the top down. There is a reason why Essex is consistently beaten by the other REITS! These are only a few examples of the way employees are treated at Essex. I have personally experienced, witnessed, and been made aware of many more incidents involving other associates being poorly treated or regarded as less than. Long story short, if you are looking for a career in property management or a REIT to invest in, STAY AWAY!!","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
Don't work here,1.0,"Apr 8, 2017",There are none to this company,"This company is a dump primarily because of the people that they hire who aren't capable of thinking for themselves and are used to being followers instead of innovators. They still use yardi as their data base system, frequent server failures, they continue to lie to their residents about rent increases not to mention their lack of security for their residents whom suffer many loses due to break ins in the california region. Upper management is terrible at responding to non management employees almost nonexistent unless they are actually at that property. They talk about a family company but wouldnt know the meaning of family because they either layoff so many great employees or the employee leaves for another company because of all they are tired of their antics. Essex will always be begind the other property management companies because they dont value their employees or have any empathy for family life. They try to fool you and hire all races but they certainly descrimunate against the Indian culture making all types of condescending comments behind closed doors especially upon a move out in regards to bedbugs, that culture being filthy, and the way that indian people speak and conduct themselves. This company also looks down on below market rate prospective buyers/leasers if the property doesnt offer bmr they again make obscene comments. They continue to lie about ammenties that are supposed to be included but are broken for unacceptabke amounts of time. They are not connected with their residents nor do they listen to feedback but instead precieve it to be another annoying resident and those residents are then blackballed by the staff at staff meetings.Dont rent from this company or work here.

"Stay Away.. Far, Far Away..",1.0,"Jun 5, 2015","SOME of the Regional Managers are awesome and know how to manage a portfolio. If you are lucky enough to get an RM that actually knows what they're doing and is not out to fire the field staff and bring in their own people from previous companies or playing favorites with their smoking buddies, then you will be in good hands. The field employees, the real core of the company and the only reason Essex is actually thriving, are all awesome and you will build great relationships. Most field employees that you will come across will be open to helping you. Another pro would be that the policies and procedures are clear (although I hear that changes are being released daily since the merger with BMR which is causing headache for the field employees). Essex is very cut and dry with their policies because they have been sued several times and that is all they are trying to do, prevent another lawsuit and pinch their pennies.","Where to begin, where to begin.... If you're looking to make good money, or even be paid what you're worth, keep looking- Essex is not the company for you. We all talk and know that you are paying some of your Managers what Assistants or Leasers make at other companies.. The pay is the worst I have heard of in the industry. They will put you on a 6 month ""growth plan"" and promise you a whole $0.50 raise at the end of it- all the field employees KNOW that this is just another way Essex can delay paying a reasonable rate. Why is Essex the #1 REIT and able to buy out another company (BRE)? Because they don't pay their employees what they should be making.. They have to save the pennies somewhere and apparently it's at the expense of the people who are making the company money. Also, this company is so political- if you aren't sucking up to the Regionals and volunteering to do their work OR if you aren't having constant smoke breaks with them, then don't expect to get a promotion. If you're doing good at your property and minding your own business, you will be forgotten.

Leasing specialist,1.0,"Sep 16, 2015","There are trainings available for new hires and employees that want to improve in their leasing skills. Company picnic and events are wonderful as it builds company moral and creates a sense of teamwork with a variety of fun games, sports and competition. Also, you get to meet employees from different properties.","Employees did not get the proper training in a timely manner. When I asked the manager if I can complete the new hire online training (that was supposed to be completed within one week of hire) she did not allow me to take it until about two months after I started working with the company. You can imagine how confusing and difficult that could have been. Wanting to learn, I asked questions relevant to the job. However, that upsetted the manager. Manager was horrible. She was very unapproachable and unappreciated of her employees. Even the assistant manager warned the leasing specialists of her unapproachability and unfairness. Manager would tell employees to do something, the employees would do it, and the manager would go back and say she never said it and scold the employees for doing it. That happened on many occasions to many employees working under her. Not sure if she is really forgetful or she is a liar. In either case, she is an unreliable and an untrustworthy manager. Forget about work/ life balance working for this company. Sure, many people know what they signed up for when they are scheduled to work on the weekends. However, when your vacation time has been accrued and you request to use your vacation time on the weekend, it's nearly impossible. The only way that manager will approve any vacation time is if you find your own coverage. How do you do that? Email different property managers from different properties to cover your property. Guess how many managers will respond about coverage? None! They get so many emails, they probably do not feel inclined to respond to leasing specialists. Sometimes you want to use your vacation time to make it to those important occasions like birthdays, weddings, baby showers, graduations etc, but just know that it is almost impossible. If you want to work for this company, say goodbye to those special moments and memories of having a work/ life balance. What was management's response to concerns about vacation time? Management's response was to request it on a week day so that there would be a higher chance of it being approved. Usually people do celebrations on a weekend. So that is just ridiculous that the solution to this company wide problem is to request your vacation time on the weekday.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm

We Feel Undervalued,3.0,"Mar 8, 2022","Essex will provide all the tools necessary to be successful. There are a few Managers within the company that genuinely will promote growth and development, though I will not confidently expressed this as consistent throughout each team. There are various opportunities for growth, and the housing program will provide some alleviation to the financial burden. However, in some counties, the discounts could be more appropriate.","Essex will say they value those who take initiative and become an asset to the company. Though when massive, company-wide changes occur, there is no transparency, nor consideration. Proximity and politics play a role in advancement amongst some teams and when challenging the valuation of one's own contributions in regards to roles and compensation, no consideration is made beyond the cost benefit analysis, not event that initiative we spoke of. Sometimes it feels like the company is harder on employees and less inclined to work with them as opposed to residents.

You Get What You Give,4.0,"Feb 24, 2011","I have worked in the industry for over 12 years and have spent half of my years with Essex. I have had ample opportunities to grow within the organization and have been able to actively contribute to the company. Essex looks for ""can do attitude"" people who are willing to communicate issues, ideas and ways of improving our overall business. One thing that really attracted me to the company was the tenure of the leadership team and various employees throughout the organization. The company makes you feel like you are an investment rather than a number or job title. The more you invest, by way of effort, in the company the more they invest in you. The property manager, regional managers and division leaders are really committed to improving the way we do our business. And we are growing! Many of our corporate departments have added support to improve things. So glad to see better systems in place as when I started we were on a DOS based computer system, little marketing support, no classes and little capital and maintenance support. Now that has all changed. And for the better. Before we were expected to do it all on our own and now there are support systems/departments in place.",Anyone and everyone who is going to reflect on a company will have things they would like to see different.

Take the good with the bad,3.0,"Sep 19, 2010",Advance quickly if you show that you're capable Many communities in close proximity,"Essex expects employees to know their residents very well but they transfer them from property to property so frequently that it's nearly impossible. Managers are expected to know their properties and residents but they don't trust on our opinions on what will make our residents happy and retain them. They generally see their residents as money instead of people and at times they make decisions that anger the residents, but expect us to take responsibility and act as though they were our decisions. The majority of my residents don't think that Essex is a very moral company, and they tell me so frequently.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm
