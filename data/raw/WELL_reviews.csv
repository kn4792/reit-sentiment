They worry about keeping things private even amongst employee They have restrictive practices in Technology, which even hinders one's work and many have said they don't have access to basic things required for their daily work.

Toxic Environment and Limited Career Advancement,2.0,"Mar 10, 2025","The company offers a solid benefits package that promotes a healthy work-life balance. Leadership within my department and across the company values grit and initiative, recognizing those who go above and beyond. Executives are committed to the long-term success of the company and focus on sustainable growth. However, opportunities to collaborate with others are limited, and while there is a strong sense of inclusivity when discussing the company’s future, the lack of clear advancement paths and middle management improvements hinder the overall culture.","Unfortunately, I experienced second-class treatment under my manager. Despite my hard work, I was often sidelined with fewer opportunities for advancement and recognition compared to those in favor with management. The culture encouraged snitching, which, combined with favoritism, fostered a toxic work environment. Those who aligned with management were rewarded, leaving others feeling unsupported. The uneven workload, lack of transparency, and poor communication created an atmosphere of disrespect and disillusionment, making me feel undervalued and isolated.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Organization of dysfunction and toxcicity,1.0,"Sep 13, 2024",Decent healthcare plan Employee Stock plan,"Working in this organization was a deeply disappointing experience, marred by a complete lack of rationality and logical thinking within the decision-making process. The workplace culture is characterized by an alarming tendency to ignore expertise and embrace reactionary decision-making, leaving employees feeling undervalued and unsupported. One of the most glaring issues is the blatant disregard for the valuable insights provided by department managers. Some senior leaders consistently sideline their expertise, opting instead to heed decisions made by a select group of individuals who lack any relevant experience in the areas they are making decisions. This approach not only undermines the expertise of dedicated professionals but also leads to misguided choices that harm the organization in the long run. Promotions and significant raises, crucial aspects of career growth, are only awarded in select departments, and are not necessarily based on merit or skills, but on the basis of cronyism and favoritism. This nepotistic approach not only demoralizes employees who work hard and demonstrate exceptional skills but also fosters a toxic work environment where office politics reign supreme. Genuine talent is systematically ignored, leaving employees feeling insignificant and undervalued. Another alarming aspect of the workplace environment is the tendency to make sweeping cuts without fully understanding the ramifications. Impulsive cost-cutting measures are implemented without a comprehensive analysis, leading to decreased employee morale, increased workload, and overall dissatisfaction. These decisions have a domino effect on productivity and employee well-being, ultimately affecting the organization's overall performance. In conclusion, this workplace is a prime example of an organization where rationality, logic, and fair decision-making are sacrificed at the altar of favoritism, cronyism, and short-sightedness. Many employees are left disheartened and demoralized, leading to a toxic work environment that stifles creativity, innovation, and genuine professional growth.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

"Karma - Enjoy NY, Tom.",1.0,"Sep 29, 2017",Unfortunately at this time the company has absolutely nothing going for it. On the outside it can look and feel glamorous but it's the complete opposite.,"Day one Tom DeRosa came into the company telling everyone how down to earth he was, that he was an employee advocate and so much more. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Tom has been anti-Toledo since day one. The University of Toledo was never good enough to hire graduates or interns from. All new employees should live in Ann Arbor because Toledo wasn't good enough for people of his caliber. As a proud graduate of the University of Toledo that was all so disappointing. Tom has finally gotten his way. He looks like the hero donating the building and property to the University of Toledo but in reality it was only done to get his way and that is out of Toledo. Management continued to lie to employees that the building they were constructing in NY was not meant for a new headquarters. While it may not be the headquarters now, Tom will be working out of that office. Mark my word, eventually the headquarters will be in NY and the hardworking employees that have held it out during the chaotic and stressful times will no longer have a job. To the current employees, don't be afraid to move on. While people say the grass isn't always greener on the other side, I can promise you that this time it will be.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
Epic Fail,1.0,"Sep 27, 2017",It pays the bills. The corporate HQ was nice when Welltower owned it. The temperature in the building isn't too bad.,"This organization went from stellar to rock bottom in 12 months. Without ever addressing its new ""course of action"" with its employees, Welltower did a complete 180 and terminated about 30% of its workforce. It became a completely strange and confusing environment. Sadly, many important tasks aren't being completed due to the lack of staff. Current management is so focused on cutting compensation that they're not addressing the real struggles within the organization. Recently, Welltower donated its 100 acre Dorr Street (Toledo) campus to The University of Toledo. Nice save. The perfect opportunity to contradict all of the negative reviews that claim that the CEO doesn't live in Toledo nor does he care about the community. That job is done. This left the Toledo (Corporate HQ) based employees wondering what this means for their future in the company. Why would a real estate company give away a $30M piece of real estate if they plan to grow their HQ in Toledo? They don't. It's a slow kill, and it seems like this company is phasing its way out of the Toledo community. This will leave so many good, hard-working employees devastated. As for Welltower's claims that they are in the utmost compliance with regard to employee ethics, managers were instructed to grant nothing higher than a 3 rating on their reports' annual performance reviews. That means that Welltower has no intention of paying their employees based on performance. It's just a lure. What is ironic, is that Welltower only has a 2.6 rating on Glass Door. That's karma for you.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Poison in the Well,1.0,"Apr 13, 2017",The cafe is pretty nice...,"I was initially positive about the prospect of change under the new executive management, headed by DeRosa and Mitra. Unfortunately, they have ham-fisted change management, and have squandered an opportunity to elevate the company to a more sustainable and long-term path to growth. Indiscriminately firing employees and falsely labeling the terminations as “for performance,” they have focused simply on head counts and cost-cutting for what can only be viewed as a setup for the company to be a take-over target by private equity, or some other buy-out of the current shareholders. Employees are scared and cringing, when they should have been empowered and impassioned. DeRosa has failed to impress with his leadership, and one can only surmise that the clock is ticking on the remaining 2 ½ years of his current contract to complete the deal. The duo of DeRosa and Mitra is about the most unlikely pairing one can imagine, and it’s likely they were dropped into place by much larger external players to grease the skids. Make no mistake, the employees are being fed a false bill of goods when they are told that the remaining “lucky” ones are in for some wonderful financial reward. The light they are told to look at is not the end of the tunnel, it’s another train.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Lack of recognition from upper management can lower morale at the bottom. Office politics seems to be a big deal here. HR team: Inconsistency and lack of transparency regarding performance evaluation makes it difficult to know what needs to be improved, requires a lot of reading between the lines which can be difficult.

Grass Goes Uncut While the Executives Fly on Their Private Plane,1.0,"Sep 10, 2018",Once a Pillar of the Toledo community.,"I use to be proud to say I worked at Welltower. Now I am proud to not be associated with this company. Management has done more than destroy morale. They have destroyed a competent workforce. I speculate this was by designed. I assume it is cheaper to have people quit than fire them. They even have stopped cutting the grass at their once beautiful campus to supposedly cut cost. Meanwhile the executives fly on their private plane and the CEO is paid outlandishly (in my opinion). Other fun tidbits: Welltower has a market capitalization of approximately $25 billion as of September 10, 2018. Per salary.com: “As Chief Executive Officer at WELLTOWER INC, Thomas J. DeRosa made $10,518,064 in total compensation.

A league of its own,5.0,"Mar 5, 2019","Pros and cons are a matter of perspective. Through past experiences, I had come to expect very little from my employers. You came to work, did a job, and went home--it was transactional. That was the norm. To expect anything more was unrealistic. There were occasional employee appreciation events, but they felt more like gimmicks than gratitude. The culture reflected that mindset, and as a result, I felt very little connection to former employers. In comparison, Welltower is in a league of its own. I view my job as an extension of myself and genuinely look forward to coming to work every day. Describing the environment is difficult. It is competitive yet collaborative. It is a place where you can make an impression, regardless of your title. It is supportive and conducive to learning and professional/personal growth. Above all else, it is a place that is amazing because of the people you suit up and work with every day. Welltower has forever changed my perception of what the ""work experience"" can be. I'm proud and grateful for the opportunity to work here, and encourage anyone interested in the healthcare, real estate, or finance industries to check it out. Or, if you are like I was, and are just looking for more meaningful work.","Welltower is one of the flattest organizations I have ever worked for. In one hand, the culture provides opportunities that more siloed and compartmentalized companies could never match--things like challenging work, cross-functional projects, and development opportunities. On the other hand, it's an environment that can be stressful and overwhelming if you let yourself get consumed by the over-abundance of work.

They will quickly throw you under the bus to save their own tail and some individuals in management were not equipped to take on the role of manager. HR did not seem to be of any assistance so employees must either sink or swim. Ever since Tom took on the CEO position this company began to plummet--employee morale went down along with so many other things.

Don’t Leave Your Job to Come Here!!,2.0,"Sep 21, 2018","The benefits are good, most people are friendly (the ones that talk to you), always something to do so the work week goes by rather fast.","The feeling of job security is nonexistent for most people I talk with, everyone feels overwhelmed, overworked and under appreciated. Many employees are actively seeking other employment due to all of the above. The company that was once a place of pride has quickly lost its appeal.

Culture shift needed,2.0,"Jun 23, 2017","During my tenure at Welltower the benefits offered were amazing. Compared to the majority of companies who were forced to increase health insurance premiums while reducing coverage, Welltower offered their employees multiple choices for insurance coverage at an affordable out of pocket expense. Teams drastically differ and if you are lucky enough to align with a team whose members aren’t power hungry (few and far between) and want to foster a sense of team you can certainly gain a lot of knowledge.","This is a truly toxic work environment and the corporate culture leaves something to be desired. The corporate office is cut throat and I could count on one hand the amount of genuine people I ran into when working there. New employees should not expect to feel welcomed. You will have to go out of your way to become part of your team only have people treat you as though you don’t even belong in the same room as them. As stated in a previous comment it is true that you will go days without anyone stopping by your desk. While there are good people at Welltower the entitlement exuded from some people in this office make those ""good"" people stick to themselves. If you do not align yourself with the right people from day one this place will be very isolating. Don’t mention any issues about this to HR, they will twist everything to being your fault and will not advocate for you at all. As the saying goes “No good deed goes unpunished” do not offer to go above and beyond or make a simple offer to assist because it will be taken the wrong way. An innocent offer to help will be viewed as as a threat and/or seen as an attempt to make someone look bad. Even your own self-deprecating comments meant to make someone feel good about themselves is taken the wrong way. Unfortunately people you will work with here are so insecure about their own position and what will happen to their jobs you are best to keep your head down until you can find a way out. Skills are undervalued and underutilized regardless of your position, who you know and where you got your degree from means more than your work history. If you show interest in a different department or to learn more in an area do not expect anyone to want to give you any work or mentor you even if this benefits the company. It was very clear to me that people some who work here even those who had a long tenure with company were insecure about their positions and this fear for your job mentality infiltrated down from the highest paid employee to the lowest paid employee.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Phenomenal Experience,5.0,"Sep 22, 2022","I’ve found my work experience at Welltower thus far to be phenomenal in terms of professionalism, collaboration, and trust. I have felt such a strong satisfaction in my role and responsibilities. I’m not going to dis-credit the previous posts because I wasn’t in the same position or time and place as those that left them, but I do feel that the company is a *much* different company than it was half a decade ago in my assessment. Several previous complaints I see regarding compensation and benefits have been corrected. Welltower is a professional environment where I have been encouraged to express ideas to improve workflow and to achieve goals. My daily duties are versatile and stimulate my desire to do a great job and not only perform well in my own role, but to create a healthy workplace where others can do so as well. HR does a great job with onboarding and getting new employees familiar with not only the structure of the company. They offer free, wide-ranging, venues of training, coursework, seminars and classes available to all employees. There are internal communication tools that make knowledge sharing extremely easy and they are utilized regularly. Sense of teamwork and togetherness seldom found in corporate entities. A key part of doing well is to being willing to learn, ask questions, and put in work to perform your job to the best of your abilities. My direct supervisor is the absolute best: incredibly supportive and responsive. I’ve learned a lot from them already and feel genuinely appreciated in my role. Anytime I’ve had a question I’ve felt comfortable reaching out and going to anyone for help and they would assist or direct me to the right person. There’s a great opportunity for cross functional collaboration. I love that there’s an atmosphere of excellence over perfection and there seems to be an approach of constructive conflict resolution. I’ve previously worked in very cliquey atmosphere’s and Welltower is a complete opposite experience. I’ve seen several people from various backgrounds, degree levels, etc be in roles. Experience matters as well as who is best for the job, will perform the job well, and be a great fit. Because the structure at Welltower is pretty flat it allows for more cross-collaboration on projects, and development opportunities. You get to work across states with co-workers and managers in different locations – which allows for a lot of diversity of thought. I love working with others based out of Toledo, NY, FL, etc – and my co-workers have been collaborative and responsive. Benefits: Current postings are 100% accurate on benefits. • Competitive Base Salary + Annual Bonus • VERY Generous Paid Time Off and Holidays • Employer-matching 401(k) Program + Profit Sharing Program • Student Debt Program – monthly contribution to my student loans each month (up to $10,000 over life of the loan). • Tuition Assistance Program • Employee Stock Purchase Program – purchase shares at a 15% discount • Comprehensive and progressive Medical/Dental/Vision options • Package I selected is the BEST coverage I’ve ever had w/ low monthly premiums • Summer Hours Program • Flexible schedule w/options to work from home – excellent work/life balance • In office gym + gym/wellness reimbursements • Modern and contemporary beautiful office! • Great culture with friendly, open people & regular fun, interactive office events! • Snack + drink options to keep you fueled and productive throughout the day.","Because the company is in the midst of rapid growth there are some natural challenges that come with that and can be difficult for some if you’re not accustomed to change, being flexible, and adjusting to changes in leadership and will have to be comfortable working across states with your co-workers and managers being in a different location. I think for most that our time in Covid has made us all able to adjust and handle this – and we’ve all become semi-experts on video meeting protocols! Also due to their being various offices and regions there could be a bit more consistency on how things are done in each region. There could be some increases in communication when changes come. This is always going to be challenging when you have a company this size, but I know it’s something looking to be improved. Obviously as a publicly traded company there is a financial obligation to increase earnings growth and serving shareholders, however in my opinion this isn’t done at the expense of the employees at all.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

The current top management, CEO and direct reports, (minus the CFO), are somehow managing to change the culture for the worse.

Indeed Very Scary Times ....,1.0,"Jul 2, 2017",The gym and the office itself.,"Honestly, just too many to list. First and foremost, it's pretty sad that the company's propaganda machine is putting in their own reviews to slow down this avalanche of negative feedback on Glassdoor. It's pretty obvious HR is entering in these reviews. You knew what you were going to get and what was going to happen when you brought select people on board in 2016 that have a reputation for causing friction and angst among others. One of the senior leaders currently there has single-handedly destroyed what was once a great company culture and environment, and instead created one of extreme fear, politics, and backstabbing. As the saying goes, you reap what you sow. Deal with the fall out and consequences of your actions. In addition, to show you how vested these so called leaders are in the company and Toledo area itself, the CEO, along with many others, don't even live in Toledo. CEOs of all the major corporations in Toledo, live in Toledo, except for this company. New recruiters and new hires are being told to live in Ann Arbor instead of Toledo in order to get them to join the company. That's a complete shame and disservice to the city of Toledo. As many reviewers have correctly pointed out, there are cliques inside this company. If you're on the outside looking in, consider your career like drowning in quicksand and trying to stay afloat.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
Confidence beats Competence,1.0,"Mar 12, 2017",Be prepared to have this company be your abusive boyfriend and keep you coming back for more because it's tough to find another place that's going to pay you what this place will in Toledo.,"The CEO and upper management are completely out of touch with the rest of the company. The CEO is a diva that cuts employee compensation to pay dividends to shareholders all the while traveling via private jet on an endless rock star tour and making no sacrifices of his own for the sake of the company. The morale in the office is one of so much fear of losing your job, trying to stay off the radar, and anxiety about when the other shoe is going to drop. No one is safe unless you know the right butt to kiss and even then you're still at risk of ending up on the CEO's henchman's infamous list of people on the chopping block. Politics aside, no one in upper management wants to take accountability and therefore the place is in a constant state of decision-making paralysis. This used to be a decent place to work with amazing employee perks but under the new regime it's just an abusive relationship and a paycheck. Oh and while they make budget cuts to employee compensation they send long-time, competent employees packing under the guise of ""poor performance"". Expect to see this place fail big time in the near future if they can't turn things around for employees. Over-confidence won't solve the problems they face that require competence.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
Toledo ship sunk by Iceberg CEO,1.0,"Sep 8, 2018","For the employees that are still around to their paychecks, there is plenty of work to do. Due to the vehemently denied and therefore unofficial shift of HQ from Toledo to NY the office is less bourgeois and obnoxious.","Very few of the employees that are left have the experience or knowledge to do what needs to be done to maintain a successful company. The CEO, having completed the turnover of the executive team and majority of upper management has surrounded himself with Yes Men. He has successfully annihilated any value and experience that existed on that team as well. Meanwhile, the core staff are being worked to the bone and are provided with zero guidance from leadership. No one is willing to take responsibility and lead. It's all about who can boast the loudest and make themselves look good whilst standing on the necks of the downtrodden remnants of what was once a talented workforce. Throwing money at vendors and consultants is the name of the game right now, in a poor attempt to fill in the gaps from the loss of quality employees due to lay offs and a toxic culture. No one in a position to fix the culture is willing to admit that there is even a problem, as that would force them to take a look in the mirror and admit that they aren't doing their job. Human Capital would rather spend time trying to get all of the excruciatingly honest Glassdoor reviews removed instead of actually doing something about the repeated complaints about culture and lack of leadership. Human Capital, the most overstaffed department at this lameduck company, is too busy patting themselves on the back, promoting themselves and feeding leadership and the board of directors poorly constructed stories that everything is just great, to even realize what is going on with the actual ""human capital"" inside the walls of the Toledo office.

"No leadership, hostile work environment, worst corporate culture ever",1.0,"May 8, 2019",Welltower is a good example of what a company should not be. It is everything that Peter Drucker warned business leaders against in his books on management and leadership.,"While there are too many mention, I will give the top three. 1. Leadership. General managers do nothing to resolve issues between the property management division and the project management division. Vice presidents do nothing to hold general managers accountable. Vice presidents and general managers refuse to talk to their employees. When people in key leadership positions leave the company, it is the responsibility of senior management to fill the voids with temps or to fill in those voids themselves. Instead, management waits indefinitely for a key position to be filled while the organization turns into a hostile work environment. Management does nothing to make sure that employees are properly trained before assuming their positions. Human resources does nothing to verify that managers have trained new employees. 2. Accountability. General contractors do as they please because there is no oversight by the project managers. Contractors leave the tenants irate and the buildings in worse condition, but are rewarded with more contracts. Welltower project mangers do not bother to read the contracts before signing and miss the fine print where the general contractor has stated that there is no warranty for the work being performed. When the contractor has finished with a project, he is given his last check and no punch walk or final punch walk is performed. It is clear that amateurs are at work. 3. No communication. Management deliberately withholds information from its employees. Because of management’s incompetence, it does not want any information to be divulged outside of its circle because the details are very embarrassing.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Lack of collaboration in work culture and environment. It's not uncommon for a whole day to go by and not have anyone stop by your desk to ask a question or discuss something. You'll be inundated with countless emails or instant messages instead. Very old-school culture where flexibility is not viewed favorably. Also, hard work does not pay off, if you're not part of the right group that is laughing daily in the hallway and joking around. It's a very cliquey culture that reminds one of high school. Favouritism is clearly obvious by some people, especially by the newer employees. If you're not part of the crowd that lives in the bustling, cosmopolitan metropolis of Ann Arbor and commute to work in Toledo, you're at a disadvantage already in your career in the view of some. A lot of politics, especially with the new employees that have been there only a year or two. If an error is made, be prepared for a special task force to be assigned to figure out what happened and who should be roasted for it in front of everyone else.
