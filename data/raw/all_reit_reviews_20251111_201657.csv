Turnover is due to Iron Mountain's lust to be a $5B company,2.0,"Jul 10, 2025",Individual teams work well together. Individual teams also work hard to reach goals presented to them. There are good people that work at Iron Mountain.,"Higher level management teams trickle down edicts from upper management to cut costs (at all costs) just to reach this $5B goal (publicly stated and released) and to satisfy the investors of Iron Mountain. We heard a lot from the CEO and CFO about where the company stands on EBDIT and where the company stands financially against the $5B goal and EBDIT. To achieve this, the company, along with their outsourced advisory company, have made changes to the company that make it very difficult to work at IRM. In sales, you do not know if you have a position on a month to month basis. Some sales cycles with clients can take months of relationship building before the sales close and used to be the understanding with management at Iron Mountain. Now management wants results monthly regardless of what the sales cycle is. With all other positions, you do not know if you will be employed on a month-to-month basis either as all positions are fair game.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

Managers are waiting for you to make 1 small mistake to play the blame game even if you do 9/10 things right. Feels like everyone has fit into this mold to keep their position and throw someone else under the bus. For a dinosaur company like iron mountain they sure hire and fire faster than a silicon valley start-up. Even though the company just started unlimited PTO, management makes it utterly difficult to approve even 2-3 day leave requests. Feels like company was forced to implement unlimited PTO to avoid paying a bulk of employees they constantly fire instead of actually benefitting the employee which is how it was presented, but sadly that is not the case.

Additional training on something you do not understand is easy to get.","The starting pay is very low, barely minimum wage to keep up with how costly the times are.

Directionless,1.0,"Jan 9, 2025",Experience navigating frequent change and developing resiliency,"The company is completely directionless and does not have realistic expectations aligned with their current market position in the SMB or Mid-Market space. You are forced to choose between meeting deadlines for low impact administrative tasks or taking the necessary actions to be effective at your job. The executive leadership team is extremely out of touch and far removed from their front-line employees leading to bottle-necks and inefficiencies in process. There is very little being invested into customer support and as a result, customer satisfaction is at an all time low. There are class action lawsuits and many complaints against the company due to their failing business model forcing 200%+ price increases onto their customer base within 1 to 2 years. Their priority is on scaling their digital solutions lobs while not having a competitive product or solution. Absolutely horrible profit over people culture and sales leadership team that is incapable of inspiring or engaging employees.

Even if you don't take advantage of that, many IT managers support flexible schedules and flexible work from home days at will. Not sure about the other organizations. IM is a very stable company with a long track record of security and customer satisfaction and in general is a great place to work. Politics seem to take a back burner to customer satisfaction and corporate success, which is rare.","Although IM used to maintain a ""no layoff"" policy, that went away about 5-6 years ago. A large majority of IT is outsourced to Bangalore India, and while those employees are generally good to work with, there is a definite hit to efficiency and teamwork, leaving the few remaining onshore employees feeling under the gun for further layoffs and also in the hot seat to do much of the after hours support that India should be covering, but lack the skills or desire to cover.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

Learning Experience -- Learn to Leave,1.0,"Apr 16, 2023","There seem to be a few ""current"" Iron Mountain (IRM) employees who have nothing but glowing and polished remarks about working there; they would give the company ten stars if they could. Not at all suspicious, right? Anyway, from my experience as a former employee: Telework options are still a wonderful thing here, at least for the corporate office. The salary offer is sweet draw (for me, pre-pandemic, it was). Even the health insurance seemed great, but I don't know for sure because I never had time to use it except to get flu and anti-COVID shots.","A lot of the glowing reviews, here, seem planted and/or were probably incentivized. Yes, for the most part, IRM people are friendly and sociable and somewhat active on employee resource groups (ERG), which aim to represent nearly every identity; but participating in ERG events, meetings and presentations takes extra time and extra voluntary work on top of unpaid work on top of your salaried job... all of which add to negative work-life balance. The micromanagement is subtle but real, right down to their social media monitoring habits. I don't know about the C-Suite backgrounds, but based on some people who I've engaged with, the employees who have been with the company for more than 10yrs are senior leaders who are likely still there because they previously were with a company that IRM acquired; they're usually the only ones that remained after the acquisition. I hope these corporate veterans at least were given do-not-fire types of contracts until retirement. If you want to stay with IRM for 25+ years, start your own company and get acquired by IRM. This company is focused on and all about mergers, acquisitions, corporate politics /favoritism and accommodating the shareholders. The culture is patronizing, at best, with some passive-aggressive superiority complexes. The small talk from higher ranks and meeting ""icebreakers"" are sad and disingenuous; there's no talking to some of these high ranks unless you're agreeing with them and/or stroking their egos. It wasn't an overtly stuffy environment, but many elements of a toxic one exist here.

Not a good to place to work.,2.0,"Mar 6, 2010",Ability to take individual ideas and develop them into corporate contributions.,"Very staid organization, business model based on holding client's data hostage, antiquated business systems, does not embrace change. But all of that could be easily forgiven, because, hey, what large company isn't resistant to change and straddled with inefficient business systems, but the low overall review is due almost solely to what I saw as extreme intellectual arrogance. Top management truly believe they have invented the better mousetrap and are just smarter than everyone else in B2B outsourced business services. When in reality, their customers just don't have any other option. They are the Cable Company of information management services, slow, poor customer service, over-priced and not truly providing the product the customer actually needs. They're a storage company first and foremost, so their message of managing inventory through a life-cycle, through a finite point, is mostly lip service. Once they have the data, they have no intention of destroying it for them once the data is no longer needed, as that destroys their recurring revenue model, and much of their revenue is driven by customers who do not want to pay the charges to pull the storage from their warehouses - many customers simply walk away from their storage rather than pay the check out charges. Quite a few of their customers can't stand Iron Mountain because they hold a commodity service offering up as a premium product and price gauge, 58% margins for basic storage means the customer obviously has no other choice.

VERY policy driven company who's micro-management regarding metrics (particularly for drivers) is ridiculously unrealistic, and sets hourly workers up for failure. Annual reviews are affected by unrealistic metrics and are used as an excuse to not give raises, and any ""raises"" you do get are a pittance and insulting. Supervisors play favorotes, take advantage of workers who don't speak up when abused, yet punish workers who do speak up via the ""open door"" policy. Upper management is out of touch with those in the trenches, and spends more resources on fluff and things that don't matter, as opposed to things that do and that would actually meet goals. Everything they do regarding policy is very self-defeating, contradictory, and they never realize it until its too late and they create even more policies to attempt to reconcile the negative affects of past policy.

Then that tough but achievable target was changed dramatically 3-months into employment by close to an 800% increase. - Lack of vision and direction to compete in Cloud - Management refusal to collaborate with the experienced Sales/Engineers they recently recruited to lead Cloud sales. - An assumption of 1% Cloud market-share penetration goals, with no real strategy as how to achieve goals. - No technology sales experience within historical sales teams - Experienced sellers spent time, effort and sales cycles working with and educating the IM sales generalists in order to garner additional ""feet on the street"" to pursue lofted AOP targets. - No strategic or complex training offered to the traditional transaction based sellers - No Channel to provide lead generation - Being built from ground up with multiple management changes. - Sales staff of less than 20 Cloud sellers in NA to drive ~$100M Average Contract Value in sales in startup year.

It seems like the senior executive team changes the focus every 12-18 months. The change to a REIT was a mistake and now in response to Wall Street, everything is about the dividend and cutting costs. Good people leave and if they are replaced, they hire someone much less capable. Morale remains low and it's been years since management has conducted any kind of survey to know how people feel. They want to be in the data center business and have been spending lots of money on it, but it's super competitive and that focus is taking away from the core business that pays the bills.

It was incredibly disheartening to see such treatment to someone who had been so loyal. New manager immediately disregarded everything we had been doing in order to adopt more uniform Iron Mountain procedures without bothering to discover why our customized systems existed or how they functioned. New schedules were created and employees asked to request the days off they preferred, with the implication that senior employees would receive first choice. I was the most senior employee at the time, but was given my last choice, and was told it was because I knew too much so the office needed me on the day off I'd requested.

Project Manager,1.0,"Jan 13, 2017","Overall, co-workers were intelligent and wanted to do their jobs well, with some exceptions. The benefits plan was reasonably good for a large company.","Layoffs, layoffs, off-shoring and more layoffs. No career path. Raises are meager. Even if you are rated well in a review the percentage bump is barely at the rate of inflation. A revolving door in the management ranks means they don’t stick with a strategy for more than 6 months. Layoffs became routine in the last 4-5 years. There was an underlying culture of fear as people began to worry that they would be next on the chopping block. In many cases layoff decisions appeared to be based on political alliances or the need to fulfill a diversity profile rather than being based on experience, knowledge and contributions. Many internal support and IT positions were moved offshore to India and other countries. This began as a gradual transition that gained momentum. This had an impact on efficiency, quality and most of all, customer satisfaction. Senior Executives express pride in the fact that they can pay an offshore Engineer 60% less than a U.S. worker. Constant reorganization and shift in business strategy. A new initiative would be announced and it would quietly go away after 6 to 9 months. In some areas of the company people will only do the minimum of what is asked of them and not look at the bigger picture and what is good for the customer. Bureaucratic decision making process, silo mentality and lack of accountability. Archaic backend enterprise technology.

Everything Changes,3.0,"Aug 12, 2013","Iron Mountain is, hands down, the best at what they do in the records and information management and data protection industry. I still highly recommend Iron Mountain to many businesses that I deal with. During the time I worked at Iron Mountain, I interacted daily with some of the most intelligent and talented people that I've ever had the privilege of working with, at every level of the company. Great pay and excellent benefits on top of that. I worked for Iron Mountain for eight years, and for many years, it was great. I loved my job, made great money. Until my last 2 years, I had worked with wonderful managers who were mature, professional business people; Managers who treated their people with respect and dignity, which made me want to do a great job in return. At a corporate level, there were always resources available, ready and willing to help. I was proud to be a part of this world-class organization. It was a wonderful ride, until it wasn't...","Enter a shift in management, beginning at the local operations level, then at the sales level. Allow a district to be run by immature, incompetent managers who had one agenda,their own, and you have the ingredients for the perfect storm of disaster. When I first started at Iron Mountain, it was an honor to work side-by-side with mature professionals who were clearly focused on bottom line revenue, who had no use for money and time-wasting feel-good efforts such as party planning and office redecorating. Towards the end of my tenure however, this is what the focus became at the local level, rather than the focus being on running a best-in-class service-delivery organization. How this was tolerated at the Executive level is a mystery. The hourly employees wanted a yearly bonus, not a party. The annual company picnics had been working just fine. My colleagues and I were very successful at our jobs for many years. As I mentioned, we had great sales managers who supported us 100%, respected us, and treated us as adults, as professionals. We were not used to managers who believed that bullying and intimidation tactics were acceptable behaviors, and the ways to achieve results. We went from a professional business environment to feeling as if we had time warped back to grade school. Furthermore, the overall structure of the sales force changed dramatically over the years, and not necessarily for the better. As the company grew and attempted to expand from a paper environment into the digital realm, the sales force became ridiculously large, with layer upon layer of sales reps, and account managers for various vertical markets and large accounts. A sale that used to be closed by one rep, now required an entire army. “Teaming to Win,” was the name of the new game. Everybody was now supposed to be a part of the sales process, and the end results were, very often, completely counter-productive, leaving the customer not knowing who their main contact actually was. Given this type of structure, it is no surprise, that within the last 3 years, the sales force has had 2 massive layoffs. Ultimately, Iron Mountain Digital was sold due to lack-luster performance, which can be directly attributed to lack of vision and direction at the Executive level. What’s my advice to anyone seeking employment at Iron Mountain? I still think it is a great company, just be aware that there’s the good, and the bad, and know that every district is not created equal. Change is the only constant at this company. Also, be very aware of increasing competition, specifically, from in-house scanning operations and very robust enterprise content management (ECM) programs that can also serve as very good records management platforms. Shredding is still viewed a commodity, and always will be, and there are a lot of other companies doing a great job at data backup and data protection.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm
The Mountain... The Mountain... what will become of the Mountain?,3.0,"Nov 12, 2014",Many utterly fabulous truly caring employees at the customer interaction levels. Corporate soul (if such a thing exists) is honorable & generous.,"It was astonishing in a sales setting to have not one manager who had experienced any aspect of the job for which they were actively managing employees... To have new employees not able to ask their managers how to do their jobs (because they hadn't a clue) was quite completely insane. When I was there I was in on the founding of 3 departments (all successful)... We had to invent the job, do the job & then train new employees (as mentors) because the metrics driven management didn't include actual knowledge of the job as an ingredient! Yikes...A larger part of the job comprised increasing spend from larger accounts. This was hindered by the gargantuan task of making the Mountain appear as a professional seamless organization to its customers. The is to say it took much energies to make the absolute definition of dysfunction appear to be something that it wasn't. Nevertheless we were successful. This was mitigated by the fact that 150 companies were formed into one & unifying culture is not easy...Initially the atmosphere/culture was congenial almost collegial. In the early days Iron Mountain prided itself on never having had a mass layoff.. With the retirement of the much beloved CEO/Founder there was the expected shift. The new CEO came from the Airline Industry & appeared to lack the charismatic character of his predecessor. In fact initially he seemed to be sort of a cold fish. Outsourcing contracts to India (with much bounceback & lack of understanding from same) has hopefully been mitigated. The few remaining US contract reps had to do all the work because the Indians were clueless. Outsourcing customer service to the Phillipines initlally irritated customers... Moral has crashed. A wonderful culture has been gutted... Mass annual layoffs are now the norm... I realized that from 30,000 feet this is all meaningless. The core business of IM is not really the business of Iron Mountain (as is the case in many business)... The real business is the money borrowing business. The business is to statistically massage the numbers to appear as pristine to wall street as possible by MBA driven numerical gymnastics.This facilitates the lines of credit necessary to keep the whole ball of wax moving... Part of these metrics includes finding earnings by massive layoffs... Hence the new culture has arrived...

New leader ideas were often challenged and not accepted, causing issues with credibility from the tenured staff, who would default to the tenured executive leaders perspective.

I started in collections and worked my way to one of the company's top billing analysts, but only after I had applied myself by going back to school for my graduate degree and asking for more work to do. I was a trusted and valued employee there for a number of years as a result, and felt a part of a large ""family"", wanting to serve and support the customer base at a high level. The company culture has been better and has been communicated well by HR; it has definitely changed from when I first started with the company over 10 years ago.","The organization is undergoing a large transition by shipping most of its transactional data and work overseas as part of a cost cutting measure, although senior leadership will not communicate that to its current employees for fear of political reasons. There is not a great deal of immediate future opportunities for advancement, as there have been 3 job cuts in the last 5 years (2009-2013). The transactional data transition has not been as smooth as the senior leadership believes it has been (in fact, it's been quite rocky and very inconsistent), and the amount of customer anger is building. Issues where customers are receiving refund checks and past due statements from the organization at the same time are becoming common. In my job as a billing specialist, there were 7 different middle managers and/or VPs between myself and the CEO of the company.

They are pretty fair and standard for a large enterprise organization. - Layoffs - Company had two big layoffs in two years. However, the last layoff, they treated most people with dignity and respect. Gave a good severance, gave people a transition time before they had to leave, Communication was open and up front about the changes. I think the senior leadership team really treated and handled the people better the most companies I've heard about. - Name Recognition - It's the most well known name in the document storage business. It also has a global presence and no competitors that have anywhere near the same national footprint.","- Lack of strategic vision for the future. Sales people are still asked to focus on selling paper document storage - something that is quickly becoming obsolete. Commissions on other services like scanning are quite low and pricing is not competitive.

When management reassigns the entire book of business for most people and pays the most commission for selling storage, they're setting sales executives up for failure. Most big businesses are using Iron Mountain for storage, they are the best in the business. The trouble is, when a sales executive's book of business is nearly 100% vended with Iron Mountain and the total outstanding opportunity doesn't add up to the quota, there's no chance of hitting the number and making money. There's also a long sales cycle so a brand new book of business is not going to provide returns for many months. There are many reps making zero commission and have been making zero commissions for months. Many of the top people that aren't interested in earning a base salary alone have left. I'm not sure why some good people still remain. I guess they're hopeful for change and waiting to see what 2014 brings. Reps need to sell imaging and document management solutions but execution once deals are signed is poor. They tend to lose the customer before they fix all of the issues and get it ramped up.

Most often, decisons are based on personal relationships vs business needs. Though the competitive landscape and industry are changing, Iron Mountain still continues to go after paper storage. No matter what you are hired to do, it's important to note that paper storage will be your key objective despite the fact that the company has so much more to offer from a technological/services standpoint. Make sure to ask about this when interviewing so that you are clear about what it is you will pressured to sell and grow. Paper storage, no matter the customer base, is mostly a price driven sell. You may be brought in under the impression that there is so much to sell along with many resources....this could be the case, but the reality is, paper storage is king at Iron Mountain and is what you will be responsible to grow.

"micro-management, anyone?",2.0,"Nov 10, 2009","they pay well for many of the positions they offer, and they try to keep the benefits package competitive as possible.","Consultants were brought in to 'help' management learn to manage better, which turned it into a severely micro-managed company. Every minute of every day is tracked, and every action is tracked as well. The data is then used to evaluate who the weakest of the herd is and lay them off. They 'claim' these actions were not for economic reasons, but being a student at the moment, enrolled in an economics class, their actions are a number one example of what companies do to build revenue so they have bigger numbers at year end. For a Fortune 500 company that has seen itself strive during all the major ups and downs of the current economy, I find that line to be nothing more than a lie. When I started with the company, they prided themselves on the Core Values that every employee was to be held to; our Total Customer Service plan has been tossed out the window. The new procedures turn what used to be a 24 hour turn around in response to well over 48 hours, sometimes closer to a week. I fear the company will soon find itself struggling to stay in the Fortune 500, because their employees are just going to stop caring and stop producing the quality of work they once took pride in providing.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

Not too happy working at Iron Mountain,1.0,"Sep 9, 2011",I enjoy working my co-workers. Iron Mountain provides me with a paycheck. Some good benefits.,"Many cons: 1) Poor leadership. Within the past year in Sacramento many managers and supervisors have come and gone (whether it be getting fired, quitting or getting demoted). The people at the top do not know how to choose the right leadership team. 2) No room for job advancement or growth. I know many people that I work with that want to learn more and try to better themselves so they could move up within the company but management only choose who they want, not based on job knowledge, skills or competence. They basically choose who they like so there is a lot of favoritism that goes on within the company. 3) Poor communication. Three employees recently got transferred to another Iron Mountain facility and there was no mention of it from management. There are so many questions...why did they get transferred, are we downsizing, are we losing business, who is going to get let go next? So much for open communication between upper management and employees. 4) Numbers.....that's all they care about. How many actions can you get in 8 hours? I know that performance is important for any company but employees are getting injured and many mistakes are happening because many of them are taking short cuts just to try to meet the company's daily quotas. Maybe the company should focus on something else..like giving the customer what they want (customer service at the company is not too good). I could probably list a few more cons but I think I'll stop here for now.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

Avoid this pyramid scheme if you can.,1.0,"Sep 11, 2022",Stable hours and pay Decent amount of time off,"-Almost no room for advancement in this company. I say almost because there are a few people that do get promoted, however about 90% of hires are external. In the rare case someone DOES get promoted, it is usually not because of experience or skills but politics. Personality is more valuable than workmanship here. - My previous point is only valid when Iron Mountain actually keeps the job position when an employee leaves. It is becoming the trend over the last few years to dissolve the job position when someone leaves and divide the work load between the surrounding workers. -They have been trying to ""trim the fat"" from the entire company the last few years. This has resulted in the amount of workers decreasing to the point were it is getting difficult to complete all the work they want us to do. - The leadership team has downright comical ideas on how to increase profits. All they could come up with was buy more companies or make all our employees do more work for the same amount of pay. They have gotten lucky because covid has made rising prices profitable for Iron Mountain and other companies. -Iron Mountain absolutely refuses to listen to criticism or any negative feedback. If a conversation or email has any of this in it, the person will completely ignore you. Instead, they keep providing lip service and plan to do this for the foreseeable future. Be prepared to hear ""best in class"", ""industry leading"", and other positive phrases repeatedly without any proof. Want to talk to someone about low pay? Why Iron Mountain has competitive pay that is industry leading! No it does not. Stop being delusional. The higher up you go in Iron Mountain, they more ridiculous the lip service is. -Their entire middle management is full of some of the worst employees I have ever seen. Brown nosing, laziness, favoritism, and incompetence run rampant in this part of the company. I have yet to meet any individual in middle management that can lead effectively. Most of the time the front line workers have had to cover for them. -There is a huge disparity between corporate and front line. Nobody in corporate seems to notice this but it is very apparent to the front line workers. 1. Front line workers receive no bonuses while corporate does. 2. Only front like workers had their pay cut during covid. All managers, salaried employees, and executives received full pay. TOTALLY FAIR RIGHT? 3. Corporate employees have the option to work from home while front line workers do not. 4. Home/work balance only applies to corporate, front line workers are expected to be on call 24/7 in case of emergencies. 5. Front line workers are required to hit insanely high quotes while corporate sit in meetings all day. 6. Corporate employees get to travel and go to retreats abroad on the companies dime. -As per above, lower level employees are required to meet quotes every day. These are incredibly difficult to hit for most employees. In some buildings, they require you to be practically running the entire shift. This is just the beginning, most managers want you to go above and beyond. Why? The bonus of higher level employees is based off of revenue, which is directly related to how high the numbers are that the front line generate. -The buildings front line employees work in do not have air condition or heat. Expect to work in extreme heat or cold depending on where you live. - The company is trying really hard for zero injuries. They keep lecturing about safety all the time and it is really annoying. This is a completely unrealistic goal because the front line has to work in a very physical environment. Being required to move a few hundred boxes a day is going to take a toll on a persons body. Nothing you do will stop the wear and tear. -The culture at Iron Mountain seems more like a cult. They are constantly creating new phrases and sayings that are repeated daily by management. We have to watch new videos, training, and various other things to help reinforce the culture they want to create. The expectation is to go above and beyond for no real reason except that we love working at Iron Mountain. -People at Iron Mountain seem to have an inflated ego. Playing the blame game is pretty common. - For any position in this company, the pay is lower than what other companies will offer. If you happen to work in one of the hourly jobs at Iron Mountain, you will probably be living paycheck to paycheck. Do not expect to be able to afford expensive things like cars, houses, and vacations without a significant other. You cannot ask for a raise, they are only given on a set date. Even then, the raises are a complete and utter insult. On average, it is a couple of dimes, if you are lucky. I mean cents, not dollars here. That is not even close to covering the cost of inflation. -Because of the low pay and benefits, Iron Mountain has a really hard time attracting young and talented employees. Outside of the corporate offices, it is difficult to find someone with a college degree. It is probably even harder to find someone under the age of 30. This is a boomer company. -You cannot start at Iron Mountain and build a career. You are required to have all necessary skills and experience prior to starting your position at Iron Mountain. Throughout your term here, you will not gain anything valuable that you can leverage to get a higher position here or somewhere else. You most likely will be doing some boring and repetitive task. -You can be fired at any moment. Job security is not a thing here. You will hear, ""If you don't like it, leave"" and will be constantly told this by management.

Don’t work for iron mountain,1.0,"Jun 11, 2018",You are able to work overtime,"- Out of 261 working days not to include the holidays you don’t get off or the weekend that you work You are only allowed 7 occurrences in a year. Iron mountain charges you an occurrence for calling in sick and you are actually sick, for arriving to work late due to an accident that you can’t control, for clocking in late @7:15 and work starts at 7:15 mind you the company gives you 10 min, but your boss doesn’t. They question your call in if your sick then text you when your sick to ask if you’re coming to work the next day. If you work as a driver they give you anywhere between 25-32 or more routes and then will add on a route that another driver failed or rather didn’t do instead of making them go back and do it... You can ask for leave and they can give it, but also take it back after approval or just tell you no because there are already 2 ppl off even though there are 15 or more guys working. It’s alll about their numbers and the $$$ they can get to fill their pockets. Oh and on the bonuses you get them every three months but it’s on the same check as your pay so your extra taxed. So if the bonus was 500.00 you’ll get somewhere close to 300.00 it that. Mind you the bonuses is based off of your superior performance. Oh and don’t have a death in the family out of town and you can get up to 5 days bereavement.. They will give you 2 and you use your time for the rest. Pay more and stop these 10 cent raises .

Problems within management,1.0,"Jun 8, 2010",Good employees to work with. Decent benifits,"I can't speak for the other braches around the world so i will just talk about management in the elk grove and sacramento locations. At first i enjoyed working for the company. After about a year no one seem to care anymore, it was just another paycheck to them.The morale of the employees is at a all time low and management dont seem to care because issues were brought up on dozen of occassions, but nothing was done. Their only concern was to make the numbers so they can get a nice bonus every quarter. All that was done was employees getting terminated for speaking up. By far in the Sacramento and Elk Grove branch, they have the worst management team i ever work for. Besides the constant harrassment of management as well as the lies, employees are faced with favoritism. There is a circle within the company and if you are not within that circle you are basically screwed. Employees have lost their jobs from following what their superiors told them to do. I lost count how many time management have altered documents to make themselve look good. All it cost was an employee to lose his or her job. Another thing i honestly do not understand how some people got into their positions because these individuals seem to lack skills in their department. I guess the saying is true ""Do as i say and not as i do"" is the real motto of the company. There is no integrity within management, they are only concern about the well being and are willing to do anything for their own benifits.

Management varies but is generally process-driven, with a clear hierarchy. The workplace culture emphasizes stability, security, and reliability, often fostering teamwork in operations. The hardest part can be the physical demands and the pressure of maintaining accuracy with large volumes of sensitive information under strict deadlines.

AVOID,1.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A few good people were the only thing that made it bearable at times. Slightly more than minimum wage.,"Working here was an incredibly draining and damaging experience. The culture was toxic from the top down, with staff treated more like disposable tools than people. Management frequently resorted to bullying tactic, shouting, name-calling, and public humiliation were disturbingly common. This created a tense and hostile environment. One of the most destabilising aspects was the unpredictability of management. One day they would be openly aggressive and rude; the next they'd act as if nothing had happened. Behind closed doors, managers regularly criticised both staff and each other, fostering mistrust and tension across the team. Double standards were everywhere. Managers could take 45 minute vape breaks without issue, while other employees were micromanaged or disciplined for minor mistakes. Favouritism was common: some staff were treated extremely leniently, while others were dismissed without warning. The job itself lacked challenge or progression. Instructions were inconsistent and deadlines unrealistic. Training was minimal and poorly structured, often left in the hands of inexperienced staff. The general disorganisation showed how little the company invested in its people. The working environment was filthy and dusty. I developed health issues as a direct result, and I’m certain I wasn’t the only one. Despite this, there was no visible effort to improve health and safety standards. There was consistently high turnover, with the company heavily reliant on agency staff to fill roles. This instability reflected wider problems in the working environment. The pay was £13 per hour, but given the conditions, it didn’t feel like fair compensation. Holiday requests were routinely ignored or refused, reinforcing the sense that staff were not valued. This job wasn’t worth the stress, damage, or effort.

A deeply disappointing experience – toxic culture and lack of professionalism,1.0,"Apr 12, 2025",Hardly I found any pros.,"My experience at Iron Mountain has been overwhelmingly negative. The work culture is toxic, with little to no appreciation for effort or collaboration. Instead of fostering teamwork, there is a prevailing blame culture where individuals are quick to point fingers rather than work together to solve problems. I’ve worked in various organization throughout my career, but I’ve never encountered an environment so hostile and unsupportive. Constructive feedback is rare, and recognition is virtually nonexistent. Sadly, it often feels like some individuals are more interested in protecting their own positions than helping others succeed. If you're considering a role here, I strongly advise you to do your due diligence and think carefully. A toxic work environment not only affects your professional growth but can also take a toll on your mental and emotional well-being.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

Avoid working here,1.0,"Jun 22, 2025",There are no positives from my experience,"Lack of training, lack of support from line manager, lack of integrating into the team. Given a training document to “self train”, document extremely confusing for a new starter. Discussed at interview about working US hours for at least 2 months. No access during the first week, shadow training the second week and then in the third week told to work UK hours and told to rely on the training document. Time zone differences made it extremely difficult to get support. Even when support was sought, told to refer back to the training document or asked “what do you think is the issue”. A very frustrating and difficult experience. Lack of contracts and quotes coming in also made learning the role difficult. Some days I was only allocated one quote to work on. Also told to ask all questions via the chat system, Manager regularly referred to the team for several queries as she often did not know the answer. Also given some out of date training information which was I was not aware of until errors were made because the information in the training was wrong. Due to Bank Holidays and 2 days holiday, I was out of the office for a week, first week no access, second week shadowing someone, 3rd week on UK time with no support until 5 hrs later - so a month in total where no real training was given. For 3.5 weeks of the remaining 2 months, Manager did not speak to me or touch base with me, no 121 correspondence at. Told at 3 month review that I was not picking up the role and that the errors I made were avoidable had I referred to the training document correctly and that I was not progressing. I would have contested but the environment was not pleasant one at all and I was happy to have left.

They have good benefits and take safety very seriously. Often my building will host bbqs, that is if our district is doing well. Internal job postings and relocation assistance. When I went part time so I could attend school full time they were very accommodating, putting me on a different shift with a different job, but keeping my pay rate. Discipline is quite different from other jobs I've worked. Instead of an attitude of, ""you did this, don't let this happen again"" it is, ""why did this happen, what can we, you and management, do to make sure you or others don't do the same thing.""","Sometimes other teams like warehouse staff will be using the equipment you need, certain items that you need on your truck for the day may get borrowed and not returned leaving you wasting time trying to locate it. Everything you do is tracked, as in, time you spent doing this work and doing that work. Sometimes things you run into during the day can slow you down and affect you reaching your target. Some things are hard to account for and you must be proactive in communicating all issues otherwise all management will see is the target not being hit.

Promises made to department projects are put on hold while this transition is happening and no status updates are communicated. Unfortunately, there is very little advancement opportunities. When there is an opportunity, you must be a favorite (aka Yes person). Recruiters, mostly contractors, do not seem to pay attention to talent given their lack of response to employee referrals. There is very much a lack of communication between departments that truly need to communicate in order to be successful. it seems everyone works in boxes and has no idea what others are doing - when they should.

During that time I have seen many incompetent people be promoted, while high performers are either laid off or given no opportunity for growth or career enhancment. Sure, they will give you more work and more responsibility, but don't expect to be paid for it. The company touts that they ""Pay for Performance"", but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Unless you are a ""favorite"" to senior management (VP+), you will never be paid what the industry says you should. It is truly dispicable that a company so large can be so corrupt. Managers are clearly hired without professional references being checked. There is an unacceptable population of managers who have no employee development skills. They are out for themselves, and are only concerned with keeping their job and looking good to management. Additionally, too many times I have seen the company hire an external person for a position, rather than grooming and developing an internal high performer.

Now Iron Mountain is in the process of training another country to do what we have been doing for years. Iron Mountain wants to be recognized as a Global Company, unfortunately at the expense of their North American employees. Iron Mountain has also created multiple customer service departments to assist their costumers, unfortunately, those teams have no idea what they are suppose to do, nor what the other teams do, and forward all customers to the IT departments.",Iron Mountain,IRM,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Iron-Mountain-Reviews-E6774.htm

It's definitely a job and not a career path. A lot of the boxes we keep the customers material in are falling apart. Re-boxing is considered something you do only when there is nothing left to do. Cleaning has also been obsolete because it's not considered an action. They have put a real emphases on ""actions per hour"" and this has taken any fun there once was out of the company. If there is ever a job where somebody is a number, this is it. The company has what's called incentive compensation (I C) but that just gives the people making all the money more than they deserve.

Corporate World,2.0,"Mar 29, 2019",Great people and free coffee.,"As in any Corporate Company, the non stop changes are something to either to get used to it or move on. The company is metrics driven and is pushing for the ultimate results at the bottom line with a very weak sales & new business focus. Everything that could be outsourced was and it definitely impacts performance of many departments. High reliability on temp force has shown to be a challenge as well. The decision making process in development of structures, improvement to business line and technology is something to wonder about. Too many delays, and lack of interest and focus makes this company a very hectic and unorganized place to work in. Too many people leave and more are given a package in an effort to squeeze a penny. Depending on department it is either over busy and employees are driven to intense overload of work for long periods of time or under performing thus creating an attitude of everlasting stagnancy. Lack of direction and clear expectations as well as poor leadership and management style contributes to overall dissatisfaction, stress and unnecessary fear.
