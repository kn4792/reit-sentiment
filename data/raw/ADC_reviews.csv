Great Place to Grow,5.0,"Aug 8, 2025","I am extremely fortunate to have spent my Summer at Agree as a Development Analyst Intern. Everyone at Agree is great to work along side, and is extremely driven. Exciting to be a part of a fast growing company. C-suite and executive exposure on a daily basis even for entry level positions. Fast paced environment. Learning/growth opportunities in real estate are unlike anywhere else in Michigan. Very nice work environment.","If you do not like to be busy majority of the day, this is not a place for you",Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
Great Place To Work,5.0,"Oct 23, 2024",Great people to work with!,No hybrid schedule. In office 8a-5pm.,Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
Great Place to Work!,4.0,"Nov 29, 2023","Great staff, positive environment, excellent benefits and perks.",No remote/hybrid work option. Some departments advocate really well for their staff - others not so much. Experienced a lot of dishonesty.,Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
Work Hard Play Hard,4.0,"May 17, 2019","The growth this company has accomplished, and continues to accomplish is amazing. There is so much opportunity to learn and grow. Leadership really has the best interest of not only the business but the people as well. Working in a state of the art facility with endless amenities are perks of working here as well.",Working in a company of continuous grow there are always growing pains to overcome. Some of which are long hours and needing to get things done quickly. But when you look at the big picture you know that the hard work you put in now pays off by being part of something great.,Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
Chew You Up and Spit You Out,2.0,"Feb 17, 2022",Fast paced and exciting place to work. Lots of opportunities for growth and high ceiling on financial earnings.,"Get ready to work very long hours mostly for optics. This place burns people out in a relatively short amount of time, something that is very apparent from their high turnover rate. A lot of people are in and out within 1-2 years if not sooner. You are expected to be in your seat 10+ hours/day and on weekends as well, even if you don't have work do. They will say they care about their people but put little to no effort into helping people be successful and very little ""team"" mentality anywhere. People are out for themselves.",Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
"Over worked, under paid, under appreciated",1.0,"Apr 28, 2022",You will learn a lot which will help you go get fair market pay and work life balance elsewhere,"Expect long hours, below market pay, being lied to to try and keep you motivated, nepotism and poor culture. It’s a culture where employees bond over how miserable they are, interviews and jobs are given based on who you know not qualifications, and an attitude of “you should feel privileged to work here” even though you’re over worked and under paid. They will offer you a job with terrible pay with the promise of huge upside down the road. That upside never comes They fake this sense of teamwork and great culture but everyone is out for themselves. The culture is ridiculously political for how small the company is. Everyone is focused on appeasing the executives instead of focusing on improvements. You suggest changes and management takes it personally as if you’re suggesting they don’t know what they are doing. The people who get promoted are those who smile, nod, and never disagree while those who suggest new ideas and work their tails off are quickly shut down and told why they are wrong. Management are all very good at the technical part of their jobs which is why they are praised by Wall Street, but don’t know how to people lead or run a company day to day. Avoid this place at all cost.",Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
You will hate your life,1.0,"Nov 15, 2021",Get good real estate experience,Underpaid role and required to work incredibly long hours. The quality of your work is not as important as the perception of your work. I approached management about having too many tasks and their response was to start walking faster because it makes it seem like I'm busier (no joke). You will be worked to the bone with bare bones compensation.,Agree Realty Corporation,ADC,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Agree-Realty-Reviews-E2645.htm
Challenging and fast paced environment,2.0,"Nov 1, 2018",Lots of opportunity to learn and develop skills. Growing company with upward potential.,Very competitive and challenging environment.
