Review During Promotion,5.0,"Oct 23, 2025",I like that fact that they look to promote from inside the company before looking outside the company. The people I work with are all so kind and are always willing to answer any questions.,"The main con I can think of is that the CPP % counts parking.

EXTRA Fake Culture,1.0,"Jul 23, 2025",I like the AM work hours,"I do not agree with the amount of perfect practices they make their employees endure. We have a once a week district call and 2 yearly district meetings. The company's values is fake and they have the ""you get what you pay for demeanor"". Since working here the customers complain about the constant Rate increases and the significant jump since they took over Life Storage. The company pushes staff to sell CPP ( Insurance) but make it optional and then try to coach employees on how to basically convince customers they need an additional monthly fee. Their is absolutely no Over Time and they ensure we do not go over time. We are always short staffed, and the DM is condescending at times with his leadership. The job is very repetitive and key word for this company is EXTRA, the customers complain the company is a Bait and switch, and also for staff. Upon being hired they do not tell you the AM will be getting paid less but to do the exact same job as the SM. They force the AM to do the SM job with different pay and less of the monthly bonus because the DM gets apart of the monthly bonus as well. I came in making $19 and got a .57 cent pay raise on my yearly review.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

I would think twice before working for Extra Space Storage,2.0,"Jun 29, 2025","There are good customers that could make your day. As long as your district is fully staffed, work-life balance is pretty good.","Upper management places too much focus on metrics and not supporting the people who work at properties. Too often, you are left working a site alone with last minute call offs or not enough staff to provide you the help that you need. Company culture has moved in the direction of being totalitarian. Some customer can be erratic due to drug use, which can be scary. There is fear of coming into contact with dangerous substances when having to enter a customers storage unit due to our auction process (Or for any other reason...). Pay is relatively low for the market considering cost of living has gone up exponentially, but pay has stayed low. There are not that many holidays that are recognized, so you will be stuck working on most holidays. Facility audits are intense and stressful. There are many opportunities for failure in sections of the audit that are out of your control. There is still no sick leave and management just claims that this is all been rolled into one large amount of PTO.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Work Life Balance Poor Management,2.0,"Jan 6, 2025","The workload is manageable and predictable, with ample free time that can be a positive depending on your personality. It's easy to stay busy each day. Customers are generally friendly and appreciative, though not always. The work-life balance is excellent, with set hours and no Sunday work, plus every other Saturday off.","The pay is just slightly above the national average. You could potentially shine and earn a maximum 4% raise, or you could switch companies and secure a 20% salary increase for doing the same job. While growth opportunities are claimed to be available, they often require relocating to a different state for the role you want, and positions like DTL, DMIT, and DM are rarely available. Corporates anti-consumer practices, such as raising rates by over 100% a month, Creating frustration for employees who lack power and must deal with negative customer reactions. Be prepared to work independently frequently, as short staffing leads to long commutes across numerous locations, with many managers being hired simply to fill positions rather than based on the right qualifications. This often leaves other managers picking up the slack, as they can't adequately cover their sites. Managers are allowed to apply different rules at their locations, making the job more complicated.

But I can remember that NO job I've ever had has ever really given a care about me as a human being. They've cared about what I can do for them. At ESS, they care about what we can do for each other. Yes, there are things they ask of me, but for what I get in return, this is the ABSOLUTELY best job I've ever had. From my teammates to my Team Lead to the President of the company, Joe Margolis, everyone at ESS is approachable, empathetic, and solution focused. I've had the experience of working in multiple roles at ESS, starting as an Assistant Site Manager, getting quickly promoted to Site Manager, then, due to personal reasons, transferring to a call center position. In each of these roles, I had caring supervisors, involved district management, and interested higher management. A lot of companies talk about ""culture"", but the culture they describe is nothing like the actual culture an employee experiences. At ESS, it isn't just lip service. They do care about making this a true positive, supportive culture.

Love My Employer,5.0,"Dec 4, 2024",I have been employed with ExtraSpace Storage for a few years now. I was recently a DMIT at my old retail job. I made a transition from the fast pace retail world and came learn the storage business. It was the best transition I ever made. During my interviewing process with the DTLS and DM I was made promises like most employers make (most employers lie to you) but ESS has done way more than kept their promises but they have also gone above and beyond in the dark hours of need. This is the only employer who I have worked for that has honored their core values and makes sure their employees are happy. My District Manager is also the best DM I have ever worked under. They make the workplace fun and for once I am not scared to see their car pull up in my parking lot. Its a good day when they come to visit unlike my past events at former retail chains i worked for.

Then by chance saw a posting for an Extra Space DM role and thought I would give it a shot. Interviewing was not easy as I had about 6 of them but after the 3rd I was hooked, and it was now a mission. This was because the company is rooted in its core values, and they want to ensure they bring on individuals that will develop and grow leaders. I'm learning a new industry where they invest in my growth and development and are interested in hearing my feedback as an experience DM. My leaders have been inspiring and supportive through my on-boarding and I'm excited to see where this new career will take me.",It's dirty sometime.

Extra Space Storage - Facilities Department,3.0,"Aug 8, 2024","Extra Space Storage offers a generally positive working environment. The company's overall culture promotes inclusivity and values employee contributions. Compensation and benefits are competitive, aligning well with industry standards. There are ample opportunities for career growth and development within most departments in the company. The company’s mission and values are clear, and it strives to maintain a customer-focused approach.","The leadership in the Facilities department is notably rigid and controlling. This contrasts sharply with the company's broader culture. Facilities employees are not afforded the same perks or benefits as other home office employees, such as hybrid work schedules. Unless traveling to sites, Facilities staff are required to be physically present in the office. The leadership within this department rarely, if ever, offers praise or recognition for the team's hard work and accomplishments. Instead, the feedback tends to focus predominantly on what is being done wrong, creating a negative atmosphere. The morale within the Facilities team is low, with many employees actively seeking other opportunities, both within the company and externally.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Great for Customer Service centric employees,4.0,"Jul 6, 2024","I have been a customer service and administrative professional for 10-12 years. I started in the Storage industry only one year ago and was quickly promoted from an Assistant Manager to a Store Manager at Extra Space Storage. Running a facility is a combination of Janitorial work, property maintenance, security, office management, administrative duties, customer service and sales. Customers and the $ bottom line are the ultimate goals they emphasize. Overall, the company goals are fairly easy to achieve as long as you are following the processes and the training the company emphasizes on a regular basis.","The position is heavily centric on customer service which can be challenging at times especially working with the general public We are the face of the company and if the customer has experienced a rate increase or another problem with our company, we are required to try and de-escalate and calm angry or upset customers. We can experience run -ins with people that are living in or stealing from our facilities. It feels like we are almost police at times in that you have to stand your ground with unstable people. It can be unnerving at times especially since the store is usually only run by 1-2 people.

Passion, Excellence, Teamwork, Innovation, and Integrity are not just words posted on a wall, but are what really drive the culture of the organization. Work/life balance is stressed more so than any other company I have worked at prior. Also the senior leadership team is very down to earth and it feels like a small family business - even though we are the largest self store business in the country. I had a hard time finding a company that was willing to take a shot on me after being laid off from my prior employer, as I was not relocatable and had worked several years in the fitness industry. Operations experience seemed to have become more specialized and it was challenging to find a company willing to look at someone without experience within their industry.

We have a huge amount of autonomy in our roles, and the customers are nice (for the most part, this is still customer service after all). I like that every day is a little different and you aren't stuck in an office, you are outside cleaning and managing your property, as well.","The downsides of storage are definitely break-ins, possible pest issues, leaks, etc and having to have those hard conversations with customers.

Sometimes they randomly change the amount with no warning. It will add $1 to $2 an hour to your check. Assistants get about half that. Work life balance is not great because someone else writes your schedule. It's rare to get two days off in a row. You will get micromanaged by most District Managers.

Anti-consumer practices from corporate (i.e. hiking rates 100+ a month) lead to employees who dont have alot of power dealing with the extremely negative reactions from customers Short staffing that leads to excessive commutes at WAY too many locations to keep track of.

My Honest Opinion,4.0,"Apr 30, 2024","Core Values and Teamwork: : In my opinion, ESS thrives on it's core values (ITPIE); our DMs not only talk about it, but they embody these values. We are a functional team, and working with each other to achieve the best possible outcome. Work/Life Balance: ESS provides a very good work life balance, in the short while I've been here, District Managers that I've worked with respect life changes and work with you. There's a lot of flexibility as it pertains to scheduling.. Work time is from 9:30am to 6pm, You really can't beat that. Compensation: Having evaluated the MAJOR competitors (I don't think I am allowed to mention them on here), managers at the store level I believe is compensated slightly better when it comes to the industry. Customer and Value: I believe company has better customer value in comparison to it's competitors, at least in my area and company is very right in translating that value in form of pricing. In a nutshell, we have more ""Valuable"" Customers with less headaches than our competitors.","Lack of Growth/No Upward Trajectory: As a store manager, just like most organizations, there's no Retail-To-Corporate Path. I guess there's no encouragement for employees to improve themselves and academics to go up the ladder. Once you're a store manager, that's it. Just my opinion Metrics and Performance: Company relies on metrics which folks at the store level has no control over. For instance, you can't judge me if a customer doesn't rent or a customer who calls the store support center multiple times and complain because they're not having their way. I feel the metrics are an inaccurate indicator of one's performance but again, Just my opinion.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

That is way too far. In addition, the people scheduling had their favorites that they didn’t send to other cities except if it was absolutely necessary, while others were gone all the time. Then what sense does this make? Person 1 would be assigned to store 1, but is scheduled for store 2 while person 2 is scheduled for store 1. Hours are still being used up in both stores… keep the people assigned to stores in their stores to help their customers that they have built rapport with. On top of this, I was hired with the pitch that you get mileage and drive time, but the mileage you claim is the difference of what you actually drive and your normal drive. Then they did away with travel time because too many people were having to leave early. Inconsistent scheduling that makes no sense. I was told a store was supposed to have double coverage and that I was her only day of it, but she still had someone else scheduled there another day. You CANNOT have over 40 hours.

Could be so much better,3.0,"Feb 8, 2025","The goal is to make you a manger so unless you just dont make the cut you will become a manager. Once you become a manger you will have your own store and pretty much be able to do a lot of things your way, within the guidelines of course. You will work by yourself mostly so that cuts out a lot of work place drama but you will need to be the kind of person that doesnt need a lot of supervision and can handle being alone 90 percent of the time. The golf cart and power tools are fun. The work is mostly easy. Cleaning units is usually basic not too crazy most of the time. You can go outside when you want to and you come back in the office when you want, Your not too micromanaged. The benefits are okay nothing spectacular but they do give you a wellness credit and there is choices so that is nice.","The split days off are hard if you have kids or are a caretaker, especially if you are single with kids or caretaking; you will constantly be playing catch up in your personal life. The work life balance that they brag about isnt really all that great. You will start at 930 and get off at 6, late start but its still a long day. We only get 5 holidays off, The big 3 day holidays, Memorial and Labor Day, we just sit here, Most of the time you will go hours without seeing anyone. There is no option for part time hours, only part time days. You will work almost every Saturday until 530, I only earn 4.62 hrs PTO every 2 weeks, It takes forever to earn enough to take a week off and you dont get any sick time or vacation time so you have to use PTO for everything. The google and mobile app review is ridiculous. They do not advertise so they push you to get google reviews every month and there is no compensation or bonus for that and the new mobile app metric is ridiculous. If people do not want their app on their phone you get bad numbers. They raise people's rent for no reason, to ridiculous amounts, more than apartment raises and customers call yelling at you, but they dont want you to tell them its headquarters, they just want you to take the verbal abuse. There is no long term customer reward and you take the hit for that, by customers and in your numbers. The pay is ""okay"", just average, its not the worst but considering how they brag about their profits it could be better. Also you will deal with homeless people trying to live in their units and then you have to go through all kinds of changes to get rid of them- being threatened, cleaning up poop, fixing destroyed units, all because they want to collect one more months rent. Sometimes it feels like they really dont care about our safety, only the months rent.

For example, they raised our rates so high that we did not get rentals to the point we ended up with 30 less rentals then the same month a year prior. In terms of pay and abilities, moving up in the company is really not worth it depending on what your goals are. If one of your goals is learning about the business, this is not the place. Whether you are with the company or not, you can find the information. You will probably have to do the same amount of digging. Despite the company claiming transparency, they are anything but. If you ask the company 10 questions, you will get the answer to maybe one of them. They love to give long winded responses that do not answer the question. You could also get as specific as possible and format a question by stating the information that you know, and then saying but you would like to know. 9 times out of 10 they will give you a response, restating everything you said you knew and not answer the question. Another con is that your previous work experience does not really mean anything to them. They will speak to you in such a cookie cutter way, that it can be very condescending. Even if you have been there a while and know your clientele, they act like you don't know anything. Despite the fact that when you survey all the guests, 80% of them would make a statement consistent of them staying there due to the office management. The amount of guests that make statements how they do not like the company but like us is astounding. Extra Space benefits greatly off of us and the fact that other companies seem to have employees that really do not care. I could go on, but to put it into perspective, I have talked to loads of people who have been here for 5+ years and they all have stated that this is just a job, not a career. There are also loads of people who were interested in the job and are now contemplating leaving. The only thing keeping them is how easy the job is.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Becoming a Storage Warrior: Tales from the Vault,5.0,"Jan 2, 2025","The Power of the Key Ring: There is a moment when you become the keymaster. Every customer who walks in looks to you like you're holding the Ark of the Covenant. And guess what? You are! No one else can enter the sacred storage chambers without your mighty key ring. It's basically a medieval dungeon master's staff, except more polished and with fewer dragons. The Warehouse Gym: Sure, you came to work thinking you were just going to move some boxes, but by the end of the week, you’re basically an Olympic athlete. Lifting cleaning bottles, climbing ladders, and restalking.5 lb-pound boxes into small spaces on the merch wall? All in a day's work. If you're looking to replace your gym membership, just sign up here and get the ""Storage Arms"" of Hercules. Customer Interactions that Feel Like You’re in a Sitcom: Every day, you get to meet characters straight out of a sitcom. There’s the overly dramatic person who insists their belongings are “more valuable than gold,"" the confused customer who thought they were renting a mini fridge (yep, it’s a storage unit, not an appliance), and of course, the person who insists you’ve “misplaced” their stuff…even though it's right in front of them. The Sweet Smell of Opportunity: Every time you step foot into the office, you’re greeted by the sweet, sweet scent of...box tape and fabreeze air fresheners. But really, the smell of success. Bonus points if you catch the faint whiff of adventure that comes from telling customers their units are most likely ""the most secure in the business."" The Secret Handshake (AKA, The Paperwork): You become a master at paperwork. While other people quiver at the sight of a lease, you look at it with the confidence of someone who’s been there, done that, and filled out every last signature. Your signature game? Stronger than a superhero’s.","Your Car Will Never Look Clean Again: You know how some people take pride in keeping their car spotless? Well, prepare to abandon that dream. When you're constantly surrounded by boxes, bags, and ""miscellaneous"" items, your car will start looking like it was a part of a sale on ""pre-owned vehicles."" But hey, it's a good conversation starter. The ""Tetris Master"" You Never Asked to Be: You will become a Tetris god, and by ""god,"" I mean someone who spends hours trying to figure out how to stack 15 couches, a dining room set, and a mattress the size of a small yacht into a unit that’s half the size of a football field. Your brain will be forever marked by the deep question: “Will this fit in a 10x10 unit?” The Endless Question: ""What About The Temperature?"" ""Is this unit climate-controlled?"" they ask. Of course it is, Karen. Sure, it’s the temperature of whatever nature says it is, but try not to bring it up every time a customer asks. The answer is always the same: Yes, we care about your stuff as much as you do. Now, please don’t ask me if your 87 pairs of boots will be fine. The Creepy Crawlies: Sometimes you will encounter the occasional uninvited guest. And by guest, I mean spiders. And by occasional, I mean several times a day. Do you know how hard it is to look professional when you’re fighting off a web that somehow attaches to your hair like it’s auditioning for a role in a heads and shoulders commercial? The Paper Trail of Doom: It's not that you don’t like filling out forms—okay, who are we kidding, you don’t. There’s always something that needs to be filled out: ID verification, rental agreements, damage reports, or a ""So Sorry, Your Unit Is Missing, But We’ll Help You Find It"" form (that one's fun). It's like playing whack-a-mole, but instead of moles, it's stacks of paperwork.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

After Merger, we are making in a YEAR with Extra Space (on average), what we were making what we made QUARTERLY with Life Storage. So the biggest advice I do have for ES, is a better bonus structure. Because we only bonus off of the amount of move ins. And that is out of our control to an extent. If 10 reviews a month are mandatory, make an incentive to get them. No bonus for merch sales anymore as well. Not enough paid time off. Another bad thing about the merger, we lost a lost of PTO. Personally I lost 60 hours because we only have very few paid holidays.

Great systems in place to communicate with customers and follow ups from stores you were at the previous day if you are at another store. They do have bonus opportunities even if you work at other stores you get credits for move ins and reviews. District Managers I interacted with were very professional and flexible but they have a heavy work load.

Part-Time and Full Time employees associates or maintenance they have you run from store to store where other facilities are short 3-4 locations each week. By doing that you have no loyalty or responsibilities to adhere to because the employees jump from store to store. There is no loyalty almost impossible to retain customers and build relationships. So don't expect to be working at the same store unless you are the Manger of the Store If you work part time they expect you to work three 8hr shifts. Be expected to work Holidays.

Terrible at Communication,3.0,"Dec 5, 2024","Depending on where you work, you tend to have a lot of downtime on your hands, which you can use to work a second job (virtually) and get paid twice over for the same time. There is a very low bar for excellence which focuses on number manipulation, so if you're good at that and it doesn't bother your conscience, then you can move up quickly in this company.","This company has a few major issues which will always hold it back. The 1st is how poorly they communicate within their own operations. Changes get made and they never inform the store at the store level until 1-2 months after they did it. Everyone is different, but many of the DTL's and DM's in numerous districts tend to gatekeep information, which hurts their team. The other major issue is that their values are too numerous and all over the place. They have 17 different values which are often times in conflict with each other on any given day, but everything is always important. And lastly, their focus on numbers and nothing else breeds a certain kind of person that learns to manipulate the numbers to show them as a great employee when they're not even a good person. Turning away customers just because they're not going to get the CPP/merch/easypay and upsetting them enough to leave a 1 star review on Google, still keeps your store's numbers looking good and your review interaction high (despite the rating). That's the absolute wrong focus to incentivize on and it's no wonder why customers are always looking to rent somewhere else.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

So far so good!,4.0,"Dec 4, 2024","Depending on your location and what type of facility you are running, the pay is decent. I think that the ones who work in an outdoor facility need to make a little more than those who run an indoor facility due to the increase in manual labor for the upkeep of the facility. Sundays off is a big perk for me. I like having a weekend day off for family, friends, or life balance. After working over 20 years in traditional retail, this is a nice balance between customer service and facility upkeep. I like that any mileage you accure by traveling to other locations is directly entered into your timecard. I've worked for other companies and the worst one didn't pay your mileage for almost 3 weeks. There's efficiency in their infrastructure here. Communication between my trainer, other co workers, and direct supervisors has be friendly and helpful-no drama so far! Most of the software has a good help system, so if you prefer to learn on your own you can. I like that there feels like there's a infrastructure that is built with the company that promotes a good work experience for staff.","The training focuses a little too much on the selling and less on site upkeep, which can be overwhelming when you're finally on your own and don't know how to do things. Pay could be better with the way cost of living has increased. Pay for out door unit workers should be more than indoors due to the increased labor. The website really should promote that the sales on the units are temporary so that customers aren't suprised when rates increase after. All corporate storage facilities have the same practices, but the lack of transparency to the customer makes retaining clients difficult. Customers wish we had longer lease options rather month to month, but I understand why we don't. Depending on how far you want to go, there might not be promotions available to you if you don't relocate.

"""Great People, Poor Leadership, and Unsustainable Growth""",2.0,"Oct 11, 2024","The employees at Extra Space Storage are truly exceptional. They are dedicated, hardworking, and some of the best colleagues you could hope to meet. Their passion and commitment to their work are what keep the company moving forward, often going above and beyond to meet expectations despite challenging circumstances. The team spirit and camaraderie are what make working here feel special, and it's their tireless efforts that drive the company’s success.","While Extra Space Storage may seem like an appealing company on the surface, it's one to approach with caution. The rapid growth hasn't been matched with proper scaling, leaving the company stretched thin. Leadership operates with a small-business mindset, continually applying growth strategies that are unsustainable at the current scale. The employees are truly incredible, some of the best people you could hope to work with. However, this creates a false sense of culture that masks deeper issues. Beneath the surface, there's a company culture that leans heavily on personal relationships, which can feel like manipulation to keep up appearances Upper management operates like a ""cool kids' club."" If you're not part of their inner circle, your voice simply won't be heard, no matter how much data or how many well-thought-out recommendations you bring forward. They're out of touch with the real work needed to support their ever-growing initiatives and dismiss the concerns of mid-management about morale and workload. Burnout is seen as a weakness rather than a signal of an overloaded system, with management implying that those affected simply don't work hard enough.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Some sites just run with 2 employees so if someone is off or calls out all the workload is on you. Also, management does not care about rodents or having a safe working environment.

Extra Space is a multi-billion dollar company that averages thousands per rental, yet you'll only see a few dollars of commission for that if you perform at the ""floor average."" The attendance policy is very strict and the little PTO you have is often denied when you try to schedule it. Our pay is affected by things out of our control, such as Solicitors, Robots, and SERVICE calls that come through to our sales lines. Management tries to tell us that ""it all evens out because everyone else on the sales floor gets service calls too.""

This is not fair. You do not get Saturday's unless you use your hard earned PTO time. It's Mandatory that you work Saturday's and Monday's unless you use PTO time and its granted.

It's not the worst,2.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Schedule is pretty consistent, and you have a fair amount of autonomy since upper management isn't physically there most of the time (store managers technically don't have any authority over assistant managers). Also the job is pretty easy once you learn all of the policies and get the sales process down. It's not hard but there can be a lot to do especially if you're at a busy location (you're a receptionist, retail manager, sales person, janitor, and facility manager all at once). If you consistently keep up with everything though you can have a lot of free time which is nice.","Pay is not good for the amount of responsibility you have (I'm getting paid just under $20/hr as an SM) and any bonuses are heavily taxed. There is definitely a gap between what different genders get paid. They also expect you to keep your wages a secret even though it's literally illegal to enforce that. Little to no overtime available. They may have you work at different stores (especially if you're an assistant manager) so it can be a long commute. Also be prepared to work alone most of the time because there's a high turnover rate and staffing is limited. They also expect you to get 10 google reviews a month which is a hassle You'll also be expected to help out other stores in your district, which is okay but ""helping"" often turns into doing someone else's work for them & cleaning up after them with little to no reward. Also unsurprisingly... with it being a customer service position, obviously it can be challenging dealing with customers who have little to no regard for you as a human being.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

We are not treated as teams only individuals. AM's are treated as maint people and not given any credit when stores do good, only when stores do bad. One DTL does not recognize the AM's in the communications to the district. When we ask to take on extra things were told that only SM's can do that. Dont see any path to advance within the district, because DM and DTL's hold us back. High turnover as a result.

You can’t get Saturdays off no matter what. It is required you work Saturdays and Mondays which can be annoying bc you never get two days in a row off so basically you never get a weekend. They talk about work life balance but working until 6 everyday it’s already dark when you get home. With no time to really spend time with friends and loved ones. So work life balance really depends on what you call it. I basically get home eat dinner and by that time I’m already getting ready for bed to go to bed for work the next day.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

An Employer That Cares,5.0,"Mar 6, 2023",I have been with Extra Space for nearly 6 years. I never thought I would be working in the storage industry but I can say it is one of the best things that has happened to me. I have worked in for a corporation before and it was not a healthy environment. I can say that Extra Space is one of the best companies I have ever worked for and one that truly cares about it's employees. I have been able to work my way up from an assistant site manager to my current position as a team lead. This shows that Extra Space stands behind their people and are willing to help them to develop a career. The growth potential is only limited to the employees. I truly enjoy that when I go home at night I do not take my work home with me and I am able to spend quality time with my family. Extra Space promotes and has as a core value the importance of work/life balance. There are many companies out there that take from their employees without caring for them. This can not be said for Extra Space. There are way more PROS working for Extra Space than CONS. As this review is already lengthy I will end it by saying that Extra Space is a fantastic place to work with upper management who care about every single one of us.,"There is only one true CON I can think of and that would be having the ability to only being open a half day on Saturdays. Though the weekends are typically higher value days, there are several Saturdays were I may not even talk to someone.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Top-Notch Culture,5.0,"Sep 6, 2023","The people at Extra Space are what make working here worth it. The culture is incredibly welcoming and really makes sure that, regardless of your tenure, your contributions are noticed and commended for the good of the company and its employees. There are a multitude of activities that the company and various departments put on to keep their employees engaged and fulfilled. Management also knows the important of work-life balance and is always flexible to accommodate reasonable scheduling conflicts with whatever comes up in life, whether that be routine/one-off appointments, child care, etc. It's not hard to see that they prize employee satisfaction as their first priority over all else, and it's encouraging to see senior management following in those footsteps every single day in the work that they do as they continue to grow the company.","The requirements for remote/office working days can vary from department to department. My department specifically works 3 days remotely and 2 days in the office each week, which can be nice for some that prefer more face-to-face interaction with their teams, but could otherwise be an issue for those that purely want a remote working opportunity. For how large the company is, the compensation for corporate employees is fairly average compared to other similar positions at companies within the Salt Lake City area.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Being as I am at the store and doing rentals so often on my own I feel it is unfair to lose a chunk (aside from taxes) of my incentive when I've done the work to earn it. I also feel that our stores could close slightly sooner. Especially for our parents, who don't get much time with their kids. I feel it may be easier to open earlier so that we can close earlier and have some more time at the end of our days.

Hands On Customer Service!,4.0,"Jul 13, 2023","If you enjoy customer service and working with your hands this is the place for you! Every day is full of variety. From the people you meet to the tasks you perform, there is something new around every corner. The customer service aspect is, probably, the most important as many don't realize that needing storage usually involves some kind of serious stress or life change for the person needing it. It's rewarding to be able to make something easier for someone who is going through a difficult time. The other half of the job is working with your hands and getting to be outside instead of in an office all the time. Maintaining the property, fixing things yourself and keeping things running smoothly brings a great sense of accomplishment.","Well, they are sort of the same. That ""working outside"" part can be a bit of a challenge during times of extreme weather and a stressed out customer can be difficult to deal with. But at the end of a 105 degree day (or an ice day) I think I feel a little more proud of myself for being able to power through.

Great job and great benefits,5.0,"Apr 6, 2023","I enjoy working at ESS because of many reasons! some reasons are: SUNDAYS WERE OFF!!, work day ends at 6pm, employees are awesome to work with, the company really cares about their employees, there are always ways to grow in the company (ESS will try to hire within the company before outside). While there are many other reasons these are just a few that intrigued me to want to work for ESS!","Holidays. ESS provides 4.5 paid holidays for its full-time facility employees, unless additional holidays are state mandated. We do not get enough paid holidays off. Which is very hard when you have kids. Another con is when an employee has worked at ESS for many years and hits the ""cap"" for hourly pay. They no longer get any increases. This is upsetting due to the fact at the end of the year everyone gets a merit review which is when you would get an increase of pay depending on your performance throughout the year and these people are no longer able to get an increase of pay. This is something that needs to change ASAP! How do you expect to keep an employee for over 15 years but not give any incentive to stay with the company? there should not be a ""cap"" for field employees and if the ""cap"" is to stay in place there should be other ways ie. bonus checks cut to employees that have hit the ""cap"" to compensate for not getting an increase in their hourly rate of pay.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Personally, don't care for property management & borderline harassment of customers/tenants. Also, the company expects you to follow a script to the tee, especially when being reviewed on your performance (being ""shopped"" - in person or on the phone). As with all companies, the goals are to get more, more, more. More reviews, more money (insurance), etc. Some expectations are a little more difficult to meet than others. One last item - being an ASM, you'll be expected to travel to sister sites when they need coverage (which is why they ask if you have reliable transportation). While there is mileage reimbursement, they calculate the distance for you & if you don't match it, there are going to be issues. Never mind traffic delays, detours, and wanting to arrive at the job on time; just make sure to get Google Maps to track your trips & timing, so there is no discussion of trying to take a longer route to get more money.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

I have seen it in all parts of the company (field, corporate, and call center). When I first started I kept waiting for ""the other shoe to drop"".

When getting a less-desired, bad schedule, there is little to almost no chance of earning a commission. Commission structure is misleading and too rigid, high service calls to the sales call side ruin the numbers your percentages are structured around, even if your actual sales numbers are high, making it nearly impossible to commission in amounts that are beneficial. Will terminate you if your sales percentage numbers are bad/too low for 3 rolling months (which if you get a bad shift in the bid is the entire quarter) even if your legit sales call percentage are super high, the service calls coming in on the sales side can destroy your overall percentage rate. Passive/aggressive performance reviews where the management acts like the focus is to help and support teams but really is to threaten your position if in the quarter you can not meet their goals. Actually very low paying position, because you are hired with the promise of high commission opportunities to offset hourly pay. Continuously firing team members as well as a high turnover rate from team members leaving due to actual commissions, leaving call center under staffed, which additionally burdens team members with call volume as they take more service calls which throw off the sales numbers.

Be Prepared,1.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Job itself is not hard, if everything worked the way it should.","Be prepared to be left by yourself with no life line. DTLs and DMs are always “out of pocket” or unreachable when you need help, and when you do ask for help, you’re ignored. You’re expected to put in hard work and sweat into a thankless job. Upper management does nothing to motivate employees, and favoritism runs rampant across the company. Everyone acts like they’re in high school. Even if you do your job by the book, if you aren’t meeting the KPIs or you aren’t one of the “favorites” be prepared to be treated like so. HR is also not helpful, the company makes it hard to even speak with a rep and there’s zero consequences for anything. Customers can be as horrible as they want and be rewarded for it. They can cuss you out and assault you, but the minute they escalate to a DTL or DM, they get what they want and you’re left to pick up the pieces. They want you to value the customer who just threatened you because they want their money. Hard to feel motivated to stay at a company that doesn’t value their employees well-being or safety. Pay is also unfair across the board, there is definitely a gender-wage gap.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Poor managment,1.0,"Feb 25, 2023","Can be a live on manager at a facility that has an apartment available (or made available as some District Managers will promise a place to someone, and fire people to open that spot for them)","Depending on what district manager you report to will probably decide how your job goes here. I was a live on manager. I had a seizure for the first time in my life at this apartment(lasted 9 minutes, had some brain damage). We found black mold on the property, in the vents, the ceiling tiles were covered with it, even some of the units that people stored their items in, had mold inside (that ruined their items). Had a quote to clean the mold. Didn't get approved because they wanted other work to be done first. The vendors that Extra Space had for the other work, would never answer or respond. So it was never done. 4 months after my seizure, I was fired. Because I couldn't drive, and my assistant manager had forgotten the deposit in the back, and it was forgotten until I was asked where it was. (My wife had also worked for Extra Space, as a DTL. She had been moved every year , being promised promotions(which she received until this last move). After our district manager started fast tracking other people and telling my wife she wouldn't be getting a promotion for quite a while, she left. Another reason I believe I was targeted to be removed/fired).","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"Assistant TO the Manager, Be Warned!",1.0,"Jan 1, 2024","Work life balance. Sundays are guaranteed off, holiday pay and consistent with your chosen weekday off.","Be warned! If you become an Assistant Manager here, I have a few lessons for you I had to learn the hard way. These warnings are specifically for the Morganton/Hickory NC area although the company as a whole has a high turnover! 1. Make sure to ask to meet the staff that you’ll actually be working with, it’ll make all the difference on your first impression of what the workplace culture will actually be like! I only interviewed with the district manager and trainer. Once I met the actual staff I had to work with, the entire mood changed! I experienced a lot of racial micro-aggressions, unprofessionalism, hypocrisy and laziness from my Store Managers and one of my trainers. 2. Although you have the title “Assistant Manager”, it is just you and a Store Manager in the store. I was led on to believe I was in a leadership position working alongside a Store Manager over staff, but that is not the case! So make sure you’re working with a great store manager with actual professional management skills, otherwise you might end up being treated like the Store Manager’s personal assistant doing the dirty work and their scapegoat when something goes wrong like I was. 3. This particular district, if they don’t like you, for whatever reason, they will attempt to manage you out. Which means making your job more difficult and having you document your progress as a legal justification for terminating you. Luckily I’m a hard and professional worker because this little trick of theirs did not work. I ended up being with the company for almost a year before I finally found something else and quit! 4. The company looks and sounds professional on paper, but on the actual district and store level, they are not! They are not preparing the Store Managers (who you will be working under) for actual leadership positions. A huge evidence of this is that the managers don’t even train you, you’ll have a trainer travel to you for that and leave once your training is over. Unless you get lucky and you work in the same store as your trainer. This creates an environment of entitled Store Managers who are protected by favoritism and having longevity with the company. There’s only “slap on the wrists” if they do wrong in this particular district. 5. Know your worth. If you’re interviewing and you know the pay is low and they try to entice you with annual or performance based pay raises, don’t settle! I was “meeting expectations” at the end of the year and I received a thirty cent raise. Even “exceeding expectations” will be less than a $1 raise. 6. This is a dirty, outside and at times dangerous and sketchy job. They don’t disclose or elaborate on this too much during the interview process, so allow me to. Don’t let the temperature controlled office setting fool you. Especially if you’re the Assistant Manager. You’ll spend majority of days outside cleaning out every storage unit on these gigantic properties the second someone moves in or out, rain or nighttime, which can be full of pests. Homeless people sleeping on the property or inside the units is a huge thing, which can be a dangerous, dirty or awkward situation to run into. Creepy/sketchy things do happen. There are most days where you’ll cover the store alone, so keep that in mind. This particular district, I was consistently working by myself not even a full week out of my training when I was told it would be at least a month before that happened. You are this company’s pest control, landscaper, handyman and plumber because they’ll do anything to save a quick buck. If you like your personal space, too bad, because you are required to drive customers in the front seat beside you in a golf cart to their storage unit. You also have to do bill collecting calls for customers who haven’t paid their bills, so be prepared for some seriously angry customers because they can’t get in their units or their items are being auctioned off! But again if you have a great Store Manager that views you as an equal, then you won’t have to worry about all the dirty work being put on just you. 7. As an Assistant Manager, know that majority of your days will be spent covering other stores. I was told maybe a day or two I will be covering my neighboring stores, which are each thirty minutes away from my home store. In reality I spent three out of 5 days every week at these other stores and I had no control over my schedule or where I would be. You’re basically a pawn piece for these managers, you go where they want you to with little concern for how you feel about it.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

"Great, but flaws exist",4.0,"Sep 21, 2023",Benefits are top notch and affordable in comparison to my past employers. I have a no deductible healthcare plan that has saved me so much this year. They offer generous reimbursement for a ton of different fitness related things and a credit you can earn easily to help with your monthly premium. They do their very best to provide all the resources you need to do your job well. If you utilize what is given you'll be in great shape. Support from management is usually top notch as well. Opening up remote roles in the national call center post COVID was a smart move. Working from home is amazing. Overall the culture is positive and the environment is good. I may have a lot in the cons section but they want feedback and I'm willing to provide.,"Mandatory PTO usage during FMLA is unfair. If you're sick you have to sacrifice time you've earned and possibly not have a much needed vacation during the year. Everyone should have those weeks of PTO for leisure and relaxation, not managing illness that prevents them from working. Communication is a constant problem. The systems in place don't work well. The disconnect between the call center and the field is staggering. The recent merger was fraught with issues and the call center was completely understaffed during the initial stages. Stress levels have been at an all time high. I feel it could have been handled a lot better. It's very irritating to see upper management saying it was handled well and not owning up to the mess it was. There's not enough emphasis on the service side of the call center. We're constantly taking way more volume overall and have less time between calls because we never have enough agents in comparison to sales. We take the brunt of customer complaints. Feels like we're the afterthought, not the priority. I dislike the ETO system immensely. It's never enough. After the crazy merger nonsense they should load some ETO in for everyone as a thank you since a lot of us had to use it to get some sanity back. While remote roles have expanded, most of the open positions at the main office are still not remote. I don't want to move to Utah, so I feel that my opportunities are limited until then. There also should be more roles within the call center that support agents and don't involve being on the phones. Talent is being wasted and employees are burnt out.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

(Anyone too corporate will tell you that you work based on the companies needs). I like the half office/half outdoor role, having a reason to get up and stretch your legs feels great. The company will stand beside your decisions when you need to kick an unruly customer off your property. They give a lot of trust to their employees. My cons list is sizeable and there's definitely room for improvement as an employer, but I overall have a positive outlook","Well, you'll help run a site that brings in like $1 million/year and you'll get paid as little as possible. A small stipend for new rentals is shared between you and your coworkers, so there's 0 reason to not give everyone first month free and rent short term. The benefits are honestly kind of trash and the company doesn't fully pay them. They help, but you'll still be footing a couple hundred a month, at least. Embarrassing for a S&P 500 company. You're a call center, a collections agent, a janitor, a front office desk worker, the escalation department, the maintenance guy, and so on. But your compensation will show otherwise. It begins to feel like a joke when you have to explain to a renter why their rates go up $50-$100 at a time with no extra services being provided to them while your wages are stagnant. The company is monopolizing the market, so their extremely high ""street rate"" is some arbitrary big wig algorithm created to make it look like its the markets fault. $5/sq ft of non climate controlled space? Are they renting a flat in San Francisco? Why are they paying this much?","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Culture Matters - But for REAL!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2023","The ""pro's"" list of working for ESS is extensive, but here are my personal favorites. 1) There is constant development at every level, and room for growth. We are a ""by the people, for the people"" type of company which values our employees. Ever since I joined 6 years ago, I have been poured into, developed, presented opportunities and have been encouraged to be my best my numerous mentors who have helped me get to where I am today. I don't know when I would have made it into the corporate world if it weren't for mentors encouraging me to apply to positions I did not qualify for or putting their stamp of approval on me as a candidate because they saw my potential before I did. 2) Our Culture. It is simply one of a kind and is the reason behind our success. We don't just preach our culture, we live it. Every employee at every level. It's just who we are and what we do here. I have the freedom to be a fun, optimistic, realist and show my slightly competitive self with no shame. 3) Work Life Balance. Although I have a high drive and work more hours than needed, everyone at ESS is entitled to a work life balance. For our site employees, our offices are open within reasonable and regular business hours. For corporate, our expectation is that you follow suit. At the corporate level, our time is precious and best spent in the field, with our people, partnering with our stores to drive results. I work a salary position, and still have a life. Lastly, pro number 4) The experience gained is applicable to life and other business situations. I firmly believe that the attention to detail that we have here is what helps fine tune the brain of any businesswoman (or man) and entrepreneur. You have the opportunity to learn in depth business accumen while also getting paid to put your knowledge into practice in a safe space that allows you the opportunity to fine tune your own skills. We have development programs, e-learning, a GREAT L&D department, articles, seminars and mentorship programs that we use in order to help set anyone up for success. This is a very unique industry that has an interesting learning curve, however, there is not a day that goes by that you do not have the tools or mentors needed to succeed. There are no ""stupid"" questions. There is feedforward, not feedback. There is the safe space to learn and the grace to make mistakes. I do not get the Sunday scaries. I do not feel intimidated when my boss visits me. I do not fear what people think of me when I say ""I am not sure what to do here"" because I know that there is someone or something out there to help me. Like I said in the very beginning, there are A LOT of pro's for working here, but these are my top 4.","I honestly think the only ""con"" I can think of is around the compensation guides, at every level. Although we do have a bonus structure as well as stock options/compensation packages at different levels, this is an extremely lucrative business that continues to flourish. The scope of work at any level is not difficult, however, it is time consuming and often times tedious. If we are looking for people who genuinely live out our company values of Excellence and Innovation, I truly believe that comes at a greater cost that what we offer monetary wise. Now. I choose to stay here because the pro's I listed give me peace and fulfillment which is more than I can say for a LOT of corporate (especially salary) jobs out there. I truly am happy working here, even under stressful or challenging situations. I do also see that there is an area of opportunity that we should be able to remedy through an increased pay range. Money is not everything, but it definitely helps. It's times like these where you have to sit down and really think about what matters most to you. Do you want to work for a company that has a great culture, cares about you, offers work life balance and a peace of mind as well as an opportunity to grow and develop at the cost of getting paid less? Or. Do you want to work at a soul sucking corporate job that you hate because you get paid more, ultimately bumping you into a higher tax bracket and losing a large lump sum of that to taxes annually anyways? I choose option 1, but that is just me.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

No second chances,1.0,"Oct 5, 2023","Benefits, Sunday's off, that's about it.","Extra space took over Life Storage, and that's when everything changed. I was a former LS manager, I loved my job, I took pride in my property, I worked hard to keep up with the constant changes, and I took it well. Or so I thought. I was terminated, thanks to the divisional managers, ""no second chances"" policy for LS store managers, and LS managers only. I made a mistake, and I wasn't given a chance to explain myself. They decided the best course of action was to fire me. It's funny how rumors can be spread and talked about, trickling down from your closest members and then going straight down to new hires. I'm not gonna let others get fired, so y'all can try to contact me and try to ""investigate,"" and try to fire everyone just to feel good about yourselves, but at the end of the day, I guess that's all you need. They don't care about you. You're a number. That's all they care about now. They made that ABUNDANTLY CLEAR when they took over LS, they treated us like we didn't know how to work storage, as if many of us hadn't worked storage for several years +. We had low turnover rates, which is the opposite of what I found out was the opposite for ES. They had shown us employees that had worked there for several years, but little did I know, there were several employees, under 2 years employed by ES. DM's will throw you straight under the bus and will run you over a couple of times for good measure. It was extra funny that they treated us LS employee's like we were ignorant or something. As if we weren't doing the same job, with possibly more trust and freedom. To employee's and those looking to be employed, ask your DM at least five times before doing something, because then they'll fire you if you do it. Don't fall for these 5* reviews, they send out a link here and there for employee's to fill out a glassdoor review. Don't think you're secure in your job, they'll replace you within 2 weeks or less 🤣 Don't stress yourself out for a job where you're a number unless you're a district manager and up.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

9 Year Review,3.0,"Jun 10, 2023","Pros: Live On Site, Job Security Biggest perk was living on site, and job security. Extra Space was very good to their employees during Covid which I am forever grateful for and they are a very forgiving and understanding company.","After working for ESS for 9+ years(2014-2023), I have a lot to say. A lot of ups and a lot of downs, definitely a wild ride. I think if I can summarize my experience with ESS with one word, I would say STRESSFUL. I remember getting hired and my DM telling me “here at Extra Space we wear many hats”, and now I know if you hear that, get ready to be overworked and underpaid. You will indeed wear many hats. Some days I felt like a psychologist, therapist, exterminator, janitor, HVAC technician, handyman, manager, slave, father, prison warden, the list goes on and on. Stressful is an understatement. Aside from literally having to play many roles, there are really two factors that determine your experience here. One, location, and two, staff. I had the worse of both. One, I worked at an urban location where delinquency was high(meaning a lot of late customers, people peeing/pooping in the building, rude/nasty/entitled customers who would threaten you, yell at you to your face) And two, I worked with many, and I mean many employees who were lazy and did the bare minimum. One thing with ESS is team work truly makes the dream work. Each property is mainly staffed 2-3 people, so the real issue is the employees. Customers will be customers, there’s always a way to deal with people if you do so with respect and dignity. The problem is when you work with people who are not self starters, lazy, take advantage, and want to get paid without doing work, THATS when the job can take you through some of the worse seasons. Extra Space is interesting because it combines both physical and mental. On one hand there’s the physical side of the job where you have to clean storage units, maintain landscaping by picking up trash, cleaning stairwells, changing light bulbs, cleaning elevator tracks, mopping, you literally do it all. Then, there’s the mental side where you have to assist customers, manage auctions, sell units, make rental/delinquent phone calls. Now again, it’s all apart of the territory. And for the most part as overwhelming as that may sound, it actually isn’t too bad IF you have a team. This is where your experience drastically changes because if you work with someone who for example has anger issues, is overweight and lazy, someone who perhaps cannot take criticism well, someone who sees a customer park and runs to the bathroom to “dodge” a customer, it becomes hell. This is when you can feel the weight pill on because if you are someone who cares about your job, passionate, self starter, but work with others who aren’t, you will be abused to high heaven , and this job turned me into a horrible human being. I loved people and took pride in my job in the early years, but as time progressed and I worked with people who were in fact lazy, took advantage and did the bare minimum, it made me a bitter person, a person who no longer cared about others, a more reserved and quiet person. This job truly took a toll on me for the worse. What kept me going honestly was the live on site because of course I wasn’t paying rent so it was a huge blessing, especially since I am a single father, however, it cost me my peace, my sanity, my mental, I’m no longer the person I used to be. I know this may sound dramatic, but I am a person who does care and I always do any job with passion and care. It sucks when you wish you can “turn off the care” but can’t. And when you work with others who don’t care, this job can feel like torture. Anyone considering working for ESS, I would still recommend to the company, but again, location and staff will HIGHLY impact your experience here.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Great place to work,5.0,"May 5, 2023","I really love working with customers but at a place that really wants me to grow and excel, as opposed to a large retailer/department store. I manage my own property and have a lot of control of what my day to day looks like. Like with all customer service jobs there are always going to be a few difficult customer situations, but for the most part I have great relationships with my regulars and I enjoy going to work everyday. I also really like being able to split my day between outside and indoor tasks. My property has an excellent view and it's nice to be able to walk or take the golf cart out and do some cleaning if you want to stretch your legs and get some fresh air. Also, when you do eventually work your way to being a store manager, most properties come with an apartment where you live on site, and the apartments are actually really nice with new appliances (dishwasher, washer/dryer, full kitchen and stove, full bathroom, etc). Most are two bedrooms one bath, and some even have a balcony or patio. I also really love getting off by 6pm every night (and 5:30pm on Saturdays) and always having Sundays off. That has been game changing and now that I have it I'm not sure I would take a job with sporadic hours. Everyone is really nice here, and like I said earlier the higher ups DO want you to get the most out of your experience and this is a company that definitely promotes from within to see their staff grow. I personally love working here and don't see myself changing companies anytime soon. If I want to grow beyond my store manager position there are many opportunities for me to do so, but I really like running my store and making it the best it can be.","Unfortunately, there are a few downsides that come with all customer service jobs and a few specific to storage. People will come in upset with either their rate going up, or something with their unit they need fixed, or even worse there could have been a break-in or rodents in their unit. These are not every day conversations but they are tough when you get them. It is also hard sending people to auction when they haven't paid in a long time, but ExtraSpace is VERY flexible and I'm glad I am able to offer people the chance to come get their items at a higher reduced price if they can no longer afford the payments.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Great company with awesome management!,5.0,"Oct 2, 2018","When I was first presented with the opportunity to interview at Extra Space Storage, I thought storage sounded so boring (I was currently working at a huge online retailer).. but I researched the company and heard nothing but good things, and am so glad I took the job here almost two years ago! Even though storage isn't the most thrilling product, what I love about ESS is that they are always trying to keep their employees excited and involved, and are constantly growing and changing to keep up with technology and trends. They completely renovated the office space so it's very modern and open, there is free coffee, soda, and fruit, monthly office socials, food truck parties just to show the employees their appreciation, holiday parties, summer parties, and more! The benefits are fantastic - great medical, dental, vision, PTO, incentives to stay healthy and fit, 401K, and more.. The executive team is by far the best I've ever worked with- there are no egos (rare nowadays!), they value their employees' opinions, they remain transparent with everything going on with the company, and take the time to get to know each employee. Joe (the CEO) is by far the nicest CEO I've ever worked with as well. There's a reason why we've become one of the best places to work!","I would say the training has lacked a little bit, but we just barely rolled out a new training program so that took care of it!","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

The Perfect Blend of a Physical job and an Office Job,5.0,"Apr 18, 2023","1.) I get to work outside doing physical work, but I can schedule my day as needed, so that if its too hot or too cold at some point in the day I can choose to do my office work during that time. 2.) If I feel like I've spent too much time making calls and answering emails I can go outside to clean a unit, Help customers on site or do any of the many other things that constantly need to get done. 3.) Lots of Career opportunities. If you want a company to grow with Extra Space is the place to be. I started working with Extra Space as an Assistant Manager and with in 5 months I worked my way to Site Manager and have had very open conversations about how to progress from here in order to keep growing with the company. 4.) Awesome company culture. Extra Space really cares about the people they hire and they work hard to make sure that they continue to hire people who care. The company values are listed as Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Teamwork, and Passion. And the company truly works to live those values everyday. 5.)The hours. There is a definite respect for work life balance. No schedule is perfect, but I love that we always get Sunday off, and that if I am responsible about staying in communication about my needs my supervisor is willing to be reasonably flexible. 6.) The people are the best of the best. Extra Space holds it self accountable to its high standard based off of its company values and it works hard at finding and hiring people who feel passionate about living a life based on values, and I am grateful for that because everyone I have had the pleasure of working with so far has not only been a great team mate, but also a great person.","Like any job there are cons, but I definitely feel that for me the pros outweigh the cons. That may not be the case for everyone, so I think its important to answer some of the questions that may have come up from seeing the other reviews from other employees. 1.) Have I had to pick up Human Feces? Yes. Was I happy about it? Absolutely Not! Do I blame the company? No. In both situations where customers choose to be this disrespectful and disgusting I had a civilized discussions with said customers and they received repercussions for their actions. 2.) Am I mostly working alone? Yes. As a Site Manager I am normally the only one at my site, which depending on the day can be a pro or a con. On busy days it can feel like a lot, but for the most part I have created a work flow that allows me to get things done in a timely manner. But it can get a little lonely on slow days. 3.) Am I required to help other stores? Yes. As mentioned before, managers are normally at their site by themselves, if a site is more busy than another the busy site will reach out for help with their calls, so they can get some of their physical work done in a timely manager. To be this isn't a burden its a way to build trust and relationships with other managers in my district. But if teamwork isn't your thing keep that in mind. 4.) Are we asked to request reviews from customers? Yes. Currently we are asked to get at least 10 reviews a month. They are easy to send and easy for the customer to fill out. It literally can be as quick as 4 taps on their phone. From opening the link to choosing how many stars to give their experience. I normally get at least 15 to 20 reviews a month.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Do not work here!!,1.0,"May 31, 2023",Very hard to get fired and gives you lots of chances to fail before they pull the plug. Gives you an allowance for shirts and shoes every year. Yearly percentage bonus based off performance but very skewed so a 50/50.,"This would be a no star if i could make it that but I can’t. Toxic work environment. Corporate doesn’t care about field level employees at all. You will work way more than you have too especially if you live on site. They don’t pay very well, corporate keeps all the money even though they don’t do anything except send emails out. For the pay, which is not good at all, you’re required to run a million dollar business every year and know everything about it. If you start to hit your bonus goal they cap you off and lower the payout, when it should be the other way around. You have a ton of metrics to hit for sales and for your store and they’re almost impossible to hit altogether. Corporate really has no idea how to run the sales process but yet require the field employees to know it better than your children. Corporate has zero respect for field level employees. They expect you to deal with rate increases and upset customers when you had nothing to do with it in the first place and then it’s the field level employees fault for not keeping them as a customer or if they leave a bad review when again we had nothing to do with the issue. Company doesn’t value its employees and doesn’t care about screwing people over, the most unethical company you will come across, they don’t care about customers and employees. If Extra Space can screw over a customer and find a loop hole then bet your butt they will find a way. You also only get 3 paid days off throughout the year. Banks are off employees should be off Also don’t expect to move up unless you want to work here for no pay for 15-20 years and maybeeee and I mean maybeeee have a shot to get an interview but the average response is that you don’t have enough experience and then they hire a 21 year old fresh out of college with no experience and no clue how to do anything. 15-17 bucks an hour isn’t worth the stress and headache that this job will put you through. Better be ready to have those knee pads ready if you want to get anywhere in this company, if you catch my drift. Also benefits package is outrageous for a field employee. If you opt into it as a field level employee, it will be roughly 1/3 your pay or more and that’s if your single, have a family then cut your paycheck in half and some.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

The room for growth is there if you wish.",Oh the cons... I feel like some employees are not recognized properly for the work they put in. I also believe some store managers should not be store managers and dare I say not be apart of the extra space team. Hard to have motivation when bad work ethic and rule breaking goes unpunished while hard work and dedication goes unrewarded. It's strange to stay but becoming a store manager is a con there's not a great enough pay bump to make up for the travel you had as an assistant manager. And that's just off what I've been told. A personal con to the job as an assistant manager is going weeks without working with someone. Having to cover down on the busiest sites in our district alone on a Monday morning to start a week is not fun.

Happy Employee,5.0,"Mar 14, 2023","The best part about working for Extra Space Storage as a Store Manager is management has a lot of respect for their front-line employees and you work by yourself a good amount of time. The pay is respectable, and the benefits are excellent. Extra Space Storage hires a better quality of employees versus other storage companies so most of the employees are a joy to work with at the site. The company has a monthly incentive pay out and the Store Manager gets a larger portion of the money. Real incentive to become a Store Manager. The hours are not too early and not too late. (9:30 am - 6:00 pm M-F & 9:00 am - 5:30 pm on Sat.) My District Manager tries to work with personal schedules for days off within reason, but the business needs must come before personal preferences. I personally like having a day off during the week. Management supports your decisions when you are doing the right thing by the company and the customer.

I had another district level manager imply that I get paid too much and she reiterated about ""time management."" I am glad to work on time management but that wasn't what any of this was about. I was being blamed for things that existed before I got here and then not get recognized for the leaps and bounds of improvements this store has experienced since I got here. That is a horribly unhealthy way for leadership to behave. People don't quit bad jobs, they quit bad managers. Unrelated but it is worth noting that I do not get paid enough for the cost of living for this area, let alone for the work I do. My rent is $1800/mnth. My paychecks come out to $2600/mnth after taxes and insurance. It's not sustainable. I intend to be a father one day and I don't even get paid enough to save for a house. I have now gotten sick from mold/mildew in a unit, I've had to come in on my days off because people keep breaking the doors, and I've had to clean up fecal matter. None of that is the company's fault but just know what you're getting into if you want to work here.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

A busy small site doesn't get as much hours as a slow large site. In a perfect scenario there should be 2 people at every property and the only considerations should be if a 3rd is needed. Shouldn't have to go days at a time without help and have to plan when things can get done based on coverage. Taking time off is a problem because of this.

Know that if you are hired as an Assistant Manager you WILL have to work at three or four different locations with your schedule changing weekly. Medical insurance is expensive. Most upper management are outsiders and only know how to run a facility in theory. Raises are minuscule. You might have your schedule changed without being notified and expected to work on your day off. No training on repairs or maintenance but they expect employees to do it regardless. Low employee morale typically caused by understaffing and being overworked. Praise goes to those who suck up to supervisors, not those who work hard (could also be listed as a pro I guess.)

Do Not Come In Expecting Opportunity Growth From The Ground Up,2.0,"Dec 20, 2019",A fast paced environment with little down time. A workplace with many goals to achieve and to track with a workplace balance that is exceptional.,"Field employees are rarely given their chance to move forward in this company causing them to lose internal talent. A talent drain with field employees has been extensive across the board with few high performers, causing the company to charge far more than the market value of units and goods to make up for the talent drain of their field employees. The only reason it's top 90 of 100 companies in the US on Glassdoor, is that it asks its employees to review the company positively in exchange for gift card chances. I would not recommend this job to friends or family members as they over manage their expectations of employees and pay below the industry average. For an example if your slightly overweight, you will be looked down upon and be told that you need to meet the company image. You can take your complaint to HR but they will do nothing if you have nothing in writing. If you get too old, in a corporate position, they try to push you out even if you perform to a high standard, which is around 50. They'll hire district managers that cause multi million dollar class action lawsuits and fire an entire district worth of employees without just cause but keep them in line to be senior district managers. Any other workplace would remove these people but Extra Space Storage embraces them.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Only 4 paid holidays, they whine if god forbid some reservation shows up 5 minutes to close on a holiday, and the person than proceeds to make 2 more additional reservations and you have to show them all the units until they finally decide on the unit they want, and by 6:45 pm on memorial day you finally get to leave, but have to explain why you were there 45 minutes past closing time.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Progressive and Innovative Company,5.0,"Feb 12, 2016",Extra Space empowers and trusts us to make decisions for our Stores on behalf of Extra Space Storage. There's no micromanaging or fear of making mistakes. The Company offers opportunities to grow as the Company grows each year. The training is great and Extra Space is committed to making it a great and enjoyable place to work.,"The pay is not terrible, but certainly not great. It can take years to reach the Corporate level. Corporate receives better benefits then the field employees do. The stores are only closed four days a year with Holiday pay. Work/life balance is decent, but could be better with improved pay and benefits. Outside of this, Extra Space is a great place to work.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Extra Greed Storage,2.0,"Apr 22, 2014",Store managers and assistant managers along with our district team leader are good quality people and are all helpfull. Starting pay is fair for the market. Paid time off is good and benefits are good . Work hours are pretty good.,"Where as the starting pay is decent the raises you get at the store level are pathetic considering the huge profits Extra Space Storage has made in recent years and the fact the store employees are the ones busting their butts making the corporate big shots rich. Now I'm a bussiness major so I understand the need for a company to increase it's revenues and profits but Extra Space goes to far as they try to nickle and dime their customers at every turn. Extra Space pushes its employees to use bait and switch tactics when renting storage units to customers. They force customers to buy storage insurance . As one customer told me sounds like ObamaCare ( where the federal government mandates that everyone buys health insurance). Extra Space also loves to jack up tenants rates . Now I understand rate increases are necessary but their increases are ridiculously high and of course it's the store employees who catch the crap from angry tenants. The computer system that Extra Space uses is outdated slow and prone to many errors which can make life hell for store employees. Technical support from The ""Help"" Desk is slow and useless. In a nutshell Extra Space is extremely greedy and at times unethical. Which is why I can't wait to find new employment.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm

Employment opinion,3.0,"Jul 26, 2019","Stability, customer interaction and hours of operation.","Finding reliable employees that are willing to do all job duties and carry their own weight. The staff that we hire for handyman work is always the lowest bid and 9 times out of 10 the work is mediocre at best. Not enough employees in our area but we just recently hired two new employees so hopefully it will get better. The Store Managers should get paid higher wages considering all of the physical work that is weighed on our shoulders. I cant even get someone to pick up large items by my dumpster so I end up doing it myself taking it to the dump, saving the company money and keeping my property looking nice. I'm not getting paid bulk item removal fee to do so. It's a lot of work and we just aren't recognized for being the brain and body of each store. Maybe if the DM's or higher up employees actually were Store managers they would understand better as to what all we go through on a daily basis.","Extra Space Storage, Inc.",EXR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Extra-Space-Storage-Reviews-E35227.htm
