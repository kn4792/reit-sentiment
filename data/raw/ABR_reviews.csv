Good position if you enjoy looking at screen and staying at desk all day.,"Intense workload during busy seasons. Salary does not compensate you for overtime. Pay and bonus increases are negligible compared to increased workload for lower end promotions. Pay and bonuses are negotiated during slow times so that the company has negotiating power to say they are not busy to pay you more.

"For your sanity, look elsewhere.",1.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Health insurance was decent and not over priced.,"1. Their processes are archaic and they can't seem to leverage technology to streamline or reduce manual efforts, either because they won't spend the money on it or because they do not hire the proper talent. Instead, they expect the employee to offset the lack of technology with grueling and redundent efforts all while increasing the volume of work with each quarter. 2. Some departments are woefully understaffed and remain that way, not because of the covid workforce throttles, but because they won't hire more people because they are ""working on automation and technology"". The expectation to offset the staffing issues is transferred to the employee where the demands often meant working well beyond an 8 hour shift and often on weekends and holidays. 3. The company is split into silos, no one works together with a common goal. And the different ""sides"" of the building are often pit against one another where accountability is non-existent, it's always someone else's fault. 4. Their remote work policy and hybrid work environment is a joke and it is weaponized to ensure compliance or it will be taken away. 5. There is no growth opportunity, every team has a handful of employees and if you're trying to get into the management level you have to wait until someone gets fired or quits.","Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.",ABR,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Arbor-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E35110.htm
