A good place to understand Real Estate!,5.0,"Sep 25, 2025","Opportunities to learn all aspects of real estate business, high motivation to grow and network",Not that I can think of,SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm
I 100% do not recommend working here,1.0,"Sep 28, 2025","Definitely learned a lot as an entry level employee--first big job that was sustainable. PTO and benefits pretty generous, I was fortunate to receive great bonuses and some raises over the course of my two years there. Met some amazing people","Senior management thinks they're above everyone else. Advancement is few and far between. You can fulfill the role of the missing puzzle piece in property management and get told you're not good enough to get a promotion even though they tell you, you're doing a great job at your annual reviews. You can be doing all the spreadsheets, tenant engagement, and a ton of stuff that is not in your job description--however, the reason you can't be promoted is because you occasionally forget a comma or don't write the actual day of the week in an incident report. Nothing you do will be considered unless you out your coworkers and put on a front that you're good at your job. But, the people who have been there for significantly less time than you and who are the most complained about amongst the company regarding work ethic will get promotions. The company claims to care about opportunities for women and for people of color but at the end of the day, they don't really care it's all a front. There are no POC in property management (I say this as white indivual). If you're not blond haired and blue eyed or in a sorority or fraternity, it's very rare that you get put in the position of a client facing role. The company only cares about making money and looking good (this is valid). But, they do not care about how the mental health of their workers is affected. Someone close to you passes way? I'm so sorry but there's no bereavement period--not even one day. Sorry--you have to be right back at work the day of because SLG is more important than your personal life.",SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm

Information Technologies - Technical Analyst Role,1.0,"Oct 4, 2017",There's a few really talented members of the team that were great mentors.,"If you're looking at this role, be aware that this role is no where near as technical as it's made out to be in the interview. Work/Life Balance - Basically non existent. You're expected to be on call 24/7, be regularly updating tickets on nights and weekends, as well as being available for overtime everyday. While the expectation of any IT job is to be ready to put in extra hours, the expectation here leaves no time for any sort of balance. Every team meeting, the VP stated that the team needs to clear any upcoming plans outside of business hours, in order to be on stand by or to be on site. This became a regular demand, not a request. On top of this, vacation requests were routinely denied, with reasons cited that go against the company time off policy. It is frowned upon if you're not basically living from your desk. Leadership - The leadership of the Information Technologies is non-existent. There are some serious communication issues that are not being addressed, and in the span of 1 1/2 years, 4 members of the Information Technologies team have chosen to resign. There is a clear lack of management experience in this department.

Expectations and goals are not clear or concise. Processes are scrambled across departments leaving the staff to put the puzzle back together, which leads to - Poor company culture. The mentality is always; I need this done now or why isn't this already done? with no forewarning or set expectation. Not a great culture to learn. This leads to - Poor morale and high turnover. The long hours and lack of communication have caused some departments to lose over half the staff in less than a year. Pushes work to the few who remain. - The above is fine if properly compensated or evaluated. But the company stresses their ""lean"" operations, which is simply a crutch to underpay or fire employees as a cost control tactic. - The below comments on sexism or favoritism is not shocking based on the environment.",SL Green Realty Corp.,SLG,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SL-Green-Realty-Reviews-E7127.htm
