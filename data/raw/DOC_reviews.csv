Fantastic Company,5.0,"Jul 14, 2025","I've had the privilege of working at Healthpeak for several years, and what stands out above all is the incredible people. The team is exceptionally talented, collaborative, and genuinely supportive — both professionally and personally. Leadership is thoughtful, strategic, and deeply values both excellence and empathy. The real estate portfolio is top-tier, and there’s a shared pride in the quality and integrity of our assets. It’s rewarding to be part of a company that sets a high bar in the life science industry. On a personal note, I experienced a difficult chapter in my life when my family faced a major health crisis. Without needing to go into detail, I can say without hesitation that my team and leadership were behind me 100% — offering flexibility, compassion, and unwavering support. That level of humanity is rare and something I will always be grateful for. If you're looking for a company that truly walks the talk on values, Healthpeak is it.",I haven’t encountered any major downsides; leadership is responsive and proactive.,"Healthpeak Properties, Inc.",DOC,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Healthpeak-Properties-Reviews-E321.htm

Culture has Changed at HCP!,4.0,"Jul 25, 2017","Ever-changing environment but finally moving in a forward thinking direction! I have seen how the company has evolved over the past couple years and it continues to become a great place to work. This will be a great place to work for you if you enjoy change, adding value through collaboration, being proactive with processes, are a great communicator and if you always have a positive attitude through the changes. HCP is a family and you have to be willing to roll your sleeves up and help each other out.",Change can be scary...sure! The only Con would be that we have been through lots of change over the past couple years but we have made amazing improvements through it all. If rolling with the changes isn't your style then HCP isn't the place for you.,"Healthpeak Properties, Inc.",DOC,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Healthpeak-Properties-Reviews-E321.htm
Moving in the right direction...,4.0,"Dec 20, 2018","Change is never easy, most especially when it is done in a short amount of time. However, change is also necessary in order for a company to progress. HCP has been on this path of change and is still going through it and with success. Under HCP's new leadership and strong commitment to its employees, I would not be surprised if HCP will be considered one of the best companies to work for within the next few years.","Work/Life balance can still be a struggle. It can vary depending on the manager. I believe that, as the company continues to make improvements on technology and become more efficient in various processes, work/life balance can be accomplished.","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.",DOC,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Healthpeak-Properties-Reviews-E321.htm
Amazing progress at HCP,5.0,"Dec 18, 2018","I have seen a slow and painful leadership change at HCP over the last several years, which at first caused me to doubt if HCP would even survive as an organization. However, in the past two years under Tom Herzog's leadership, HCP has finally started getting our stride in laying a strong foundation for growth. We've cleaned up our portfolio to attain more favorable street ratings in addition to having a now unified leadership team who is truly concerned with employee welfare and engagement. We still have a lot of heavy lifting to do with regards to changing our employment culture, but I have seen a steady stream of improvements in that arena. From small things like more casual dress code and daily healthy snack offerings to large things like a new fitness reimbursement policy, even more attractive benefit offerings (a completely free HMO option in addition to lowered rates in general), and above market compensation, HCP is truly becoming a place where many would desire to work, even if just based on the perks and compensation alone. In addition to all this, HCP has very intelligent, committed, hard-working, and genuine employees. I'm excited to see our progress continue to unfold in the upcoming years, especially with our new and forward-thinking leadership team in place.","HCP is still going through change daily, and that is likely to remain a constant as our goal is to be continually improving and evolving as an organization. If you don't like change, especially change on steroids and as a constant, HCP won't be the right environment for you. Also, growth paths are limited since we are small with regard to headcount. We are starting to hire more entry-level employees who will have more growth opportunities within their HCP career, but for those in middle management or further along in their career, the ladder is very short or non-existent. Work/Life/Balance is also a concern that is being improved but still needs much work. Because we are small and have taken on many process improvement and technology implementation projects across the organization, workloads continue to be large and a bit overwhelming for many employees. The company is becoming more flexible and allowing employees to work from home/remotely on an as-needed basis depending on the team, which does help those employees with families and/or other obligations outside of work.","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.",DOC,Health Care,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Healthpeak-Properties-Reviews-E321.htm
Solid Company,4.0,"Feb 23, 2023",- Good benefits. Above market pay - Promotions typically fair. Based on personal readiness and organizational space/needs - strong and talented teammates - flexible WFH,"- Tough work/life balance. Long hours - Company completely changed its strategy about 4 times while I was there. Changed CEOs 4 times too. Moved the HQ to Denver.

Think twice about joining this company,1.0,"Jun 7, 2010","Although HCP is a S&P company, the CEO manages it as if it was a family business. Literally every little decisiosn must be approved by the CEO. There is little input from other senior leaders and they are unable and unwilling to make independent decisions that are customary at other companies. The CEO and other members of senior managemnt maintian a distance frm having to interact with employees. Performance management is a farce.
