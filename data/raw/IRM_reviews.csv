Turnover is due to Iron Mountain's lust to be a $5B company,2.0,"Jul 10, 2025",Individual teams work well together. Individual teams also work hard to reach goals presented to them. There are good people that work at Iron Mountain.,"Higher level management teams trickle down edicts from upper management to cut costs (at all costs) just to reach this $5B goal (publicly stated and released) and to satisfy the investors of Iron Mountain. We heard a lot from the CEO and CFO about where the company stands on EBDIT and where the company stands financially against the $5B goal and EBDIT. To achieve this, the company, along with their outsourced advisory company, have made changes to the company that make it very difficult to work at IRM. In sales, you do not know if you have a position on a month to month basis. Some sales cycles with clients can take months of relationship building before the sales close and used to be the understanding with management at Iron Mountain.

Stubborn managers and leadership with no recognition for any creative work or working overtime to get additional last minute tasks done. Managers are waiting for you to make 1 small mistake to play the blame game even if you do 9/10 things right. Feels like everyone has fit into this mold to keep their position and throw someone else under the bus. For a dinosaur company like iron mountain they sure hire and fire faster than a silicon valley start-up. Even though the company just started unlimited PTO, management makes it utterly difficult to approve even 2-3 day leave requests. Feels like company was forced to implement unlimited PTO to avoid paying a bulk of employees they constantly fire instead of actually benefitting the employee which is how it was presented, but sadly that is not the case.

Additional training on something you do not understand is easy to get.","The starting pay is very low, barely minimum wage to keep up with how costly the times are. The workplace is very physically crowded which fosters gossip, and is probably unsafe for HIPAA policy honestly.

There are class action lawsuits and many complaints against the company due to their failing business model forcing 200%+ price increases onto their customer base within 1 to 2 years.
