American Assets Trust,5.0,"Apr 16, 2025","Great work/life balance, amenities, staff and leadership.",None to report at this time.,American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
"Low-Quality Employer, Toxic Work Culture",1.0,"Feb 13, 2025",This was the worst employer I've ever worked for and I wish I had paid attention to all the negative reviews. The hiring manager told me during the interview that it was a great place to work. The reality is that American Assets management is unethical and encourages unhealthy competition between employees. There's no work/life balance and you're expected to work weekends. Burnout is common and management doesn't care about employees' well-being at all. The only thing they value is money. This is why American Assets is constantly getting sued (more than seven lawsuits in San Diego alone in the past year). There was high turnover at the property I worked at. People either quit in a short amount of time because of the toxic work culture or were fired. Don't expect job security or loyalty from American Assets.,Management doesn't comply with some laws and encourages an unhealthy work culture.,American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Varied leadership,2.0,"Mar 10, 2025",Work life balance depends on department. Nice office.,Management/leadership depends on the department. Tone at the top doesn’t always trickle down to middle management. 5 days in office is archaic.,American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
American Assets Devalues Employees,1.0,"Aug 23, 2024",Pay is good for some positions.,"American Assets has to pay good wages, otherwise who would work for them? The company has a rigid, toxic work culture. Poor work-life balance, micromanaging and a lack of communication from supervisors are the norm. Management lacks empathy and respect for employees. They claim that they want to provide a fair and inclusive workplace, yet they stifle employees and ignore their complaints. And they're obsessed with appearances. My former supervisor is unprofessional and lacks leadership skills. I had a warning sign that he was a bad boss when he asked me an inappropriate question during the interview. His boss isn't any better. I wasn't the only one who was miserable. My co-workers would say things like, ""If I'm one minute late from break, I'll be in trouble"" and ""I hate the office politics here."" If you value your mental health, don't work for American Assets.",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm

Excellent benefits and fair salaries. HR works hard to accommodate everyone and make sure they feel welcomed. Corporate employees are very friendly and helpful. Work for Earnest Rady!",I wouldn't say its a downside but there's room for improvement. Some procedures are not efficient and things could be more consistent/uniformed. Contracts process is very time consuming and tedious.

Good stepstone til you find a batter opportunity.","No growth, some managers have questionable intentions, managers do not mentor, I've seen temper tantrums from a superior, some micro managing and be-mottling but certain managers, there are a lot of ""politics"", arrogance of certain management, no recognition for busting your bum, low moral and motivation, far below average pay, little to no yearly raise and poor bonuses.",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Great people & comfortable lifestyle,4.0,"Apr 15, 2019","I'm a recent new hire at AAT, and thus far everyone has been kind and welcoming. The team is high performing, but with good work/life balance (including yoga twice each week from noon - 1pm). The facilities are beautiful, and the assets owned by AAT are irreplaceable. I'm very happy with my new position and would recommend AAT to any prospective employees!","Executives generally want you to be in-office (i.e. minimal work from home). There are opportunities to get things done on your own time at home, but generally speaking you're expected to be on-site during work hours. That being said - this is in many ways a pro, as the work stops when you leave the office which is not the case with many companies. I have found this to be highly beneficial for my life, both physically and emotionally.",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
So much potential but toxic culture is holding them back,2.0,"Aug 8, 2020",Advancement within company is pretty good and they have amazing assets. Onsite living an option for managers.,"Company culture is toxic. Profit driven instead of value driven, at least in the multi family side. Business systems are chaotic as they use multiple platforms and there are always integration issues which makes managing an asset 10x harder than it should be. Pay is awful, HR department is shady and gaslight hard workers. Cliques are a huge part of the culture and not in a good way. Offers no proper training what so ever. This company has so much potential but a lot of bad actors in mid level management are holding the company back.",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
"If you can find something else, just go!",1.0,"Jul 12, 2016","Majority of the staff are truly genuine and cares, take note I said “staff.” Anyone in an office, consider “stuck up, obnoxious, and rude.” Truly micro-managers, they get hard-ons by bullying their staff. All the good managers were either real human beings and were just too nice and smart to stick around and left, and now we’re stuck with the bad ones. Total culture shock at this place with managers having a huge language barrier; please have management attend ESL classes. Management loves to humiliate staff whenever mistakes occur and provides little to no training what so ever.","High, as in very HIGH turn-over rate. Managers don't care about their staff and loves it when their staff fails and makes mistakes, it gives managers something to talk about in their management meetings.",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
Employee Beware,1.0,"Mar 4, 2018","Beautiful building, security, delicious cafe downstairs. and free parking.","First and foremost, this company does not train, they expect you to know it all on the job and if you ask questions twice, you are labeled incompetent. Your performance on the job is all criticized at the time of your review, there is NO verbal warnings. Most managers have been there for many years and they supervise unfairly, they have their favorites and let them get away with rules, while others that are in their radar, punished constantly. They do not foster a healthy, encourage for success environment. And be careful, HR is not a safe haven, unfair treatment and assumptions are quickly determined. So if you want to work in the ""lion's den"" then apply and get hired. Good luck!",American Assets Trust,AAT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Assets-Trust-Reviews-E354669.htm
AWFUL,1.0,"Nov 8, 2017",Not a lot of nice things to say about this company. Nice picnic I guess. The owner is a good man who just has bad people under him.,"Awful HR. While I was there a a VP was indicted. For 6 months I listened to my manager lie, gossip and discriminate against co-workers and customers. She was away from the office 30% of the week with no explanation. Did not follow company policies 50% of the time. Also a girl transferred over from another office because her boss had been verbally abusing her and forcing her to take on the manager's duties while the manager was absent. HR would never respond to emails. Huge violation. My last day she lied about losing her keys and asked for mine then had HR call me after I left and tell me not to come back with no explanation.

Pay and bonus increases are negligible compared to increased workload for lower end promotions. Pay and bonuses are negotiated during slow times so that the company has negotiating power to say they are not busy to pay you more.

Strong Company with a Great Culture,5.0,"Aug 27, 2024","Having worked here for 11 plus years I have seen the company grow both in size but also in the culture. Arbor is a great place to work.

"For your sanity, look elsewhere.",1.0,"Oct 19, 2023",Health insurance was decent and not over priced.,"1. Their processes are archaic and they can't seem to leverage technology to streamline or reduce manual efforts, either because they won't spend the money on it or because they do not hire the proper talent. Instead, they expect the employee to offset the lack of technology with grueling and redundent efforts all while increasing the volume of work with each quarter. 2. Some departments are woefully understaffed and remain that way, not because of the covid workforce throttles, but because they won't hire more people because they are ""working on automation and technology"". The expectation to offset the staffing issues is transferred to the employee where the demands often meant working well beyond an 8 hour shift and often on weekends and holidays. 3. The company is split into silos, no one works together with a common goal. And the different ""sides"" of the building are often pit against one another where accountability is non-existent, it's always someone else's fault. 4. Their remote work policy and hybrid work environment is a joke and it is weaponized to ensure compliance or it will be taken away. 5. There is no growth opportunity, every team has a handful of employees and if you're trying to get into the management level you have to wait until someone gets fired or quits.","Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.",ABR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Arbor-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E35110.htm

Don't Expect to Advance to the Top,2.0,"Jun 12, 2008","Convenient location if you live in Nassau County. You will see business, since Arbor is known in the market. Arbor is in the business of making money so when the market is strong, deals do get done. If you are straight out of college, it's a decent place to hang for 18-24 months as you will get a decent amount of experience under your belt. If you are more seasoned --i.e., 10+ years of experience--then it's more a roll of the dice. Benefits are OK, but don't expect 2-for-1 401-k matching--or even 1-for-1. If you like bagels then you're all set: Free bagels on Wed morning.","Small company mentality. Senior management does what it wants, doesn't deem it necessary to communicate with the rank and file. Keeps pay low and advancement is difficult unless you are a favored son/daughter. If your group head doesn't strongly push for recognition for his people don't expect to see raises or promotions coming your way. You will feel that while senior management gets richer, you are stuck in a rut. There's a large sense of people looking out for themselves. No true team spirit. Also, if you have ever worked in NYC you will note the big downside to being out of it by working in the 'burbs.","Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.",ABR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Arbor-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E35110.htm

There is very little diversity and employee satisfaction is not at all a concern. Deal related standards/best practices and employee well being are regularly thrown out in favor of profits, especially as quarters end. Again, this is somewhat true of many firms in the business, but it is unapologetically rampant here. The firm experienced multiple mass resignations while I was there.

Toxic corporate work environment,1.0,"Sep 29, 2023","Free snacks and drinks every day when in office, lots of Brandywine branded swag, good health benefits, some great people to work with, huge budget for projects.","The work environment at the company is characterized by a pervasive culture of competitiveness, where personal advancement often takes precedence over ethical conduct. Interactions with colleagues are marred by an ulterior motive to extract information that can be later used against individuals. Furthermore, the marketing department is overseen by managers lacking design expertise, leading to a lack of understanding regarding project complexities and time requirements for designers. Employees are unfortunately treated as expendable resources due to the abundance of job applications received. The marketing department witnesses a high turnover rate, except for upper management, who remain insulated from these changes. Attempts to address the excessive workload have been met with dismissive responses, fostering a tense atmosphere in the office. Interpersonal conflicts are rampant within the department, exacerbated by the exclusivity of decision-making among a select few individuals. Until the company acknowledges and acts upon the feedback provided, particularly concerning the need for a manager with a design background who can advocate for the designers, this cycle of high turnover is likely to persist. Unfortunately, the current project manager has not demonstrated the willingness or ability to fulfill this role. Additionally, the company does not prioritize the mental well-being of its employees, focusing primarily on meeting deadlines and discouraging expressions of concern. It is imperative for the company to reevaluate its management approach, fostering a supportive and inclusive environment that values the contributions and mental health of its workforce.",Brandywine Realty Trust,BDN,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brandywine-Realty-Reviews-E2532.htm

Waspy and Plastic,1.0,"Jul 1, 2020",The office is beautiful and some departments are great.,"In accounting it is a toxic working environment. The workload is unreasonable and you are expected to work late everyday as well as on weekends and while on vacation or leave. Office politics are heavy and so workload is distributed unevenly and they suffer from being severely understaffed. As a result the turnover rate is incredibly high. When things go wrong there is no accountability from management and the blame is often unfairly shifted. There is also a 'firing culture' unlike anything I've ever seen. Anything bad that happens they sweep under the rug and because of the culture people are too afraid to speak up. It really is a nightmare workplace. Steer clear of accounting.

This is hands down the best company I have ever worked for.,5.0,"Jan 21, 2025","Here’s the updated review incorporating your new points: 5 Stars - The Best Employer I’ve Worked For Starting with CBL 9 months ago has been one of the best career decisions I’ve ever made. After 22 years in the industry and working with countless management companies (many of which left much to be desired), I was blown away by how different CBL truly is. Their vetting process was extensive and, though it was intense, you could tell they were on the right path and committed to finding the best fit for their team. From the very beginning, it was clear that they take the time to know their people and ensure they’re making the right decisions for both the company and the employee. From day one, CBL has exceeded my expectations. The interviews were engaging and professional, and it was apparent they do things the right way. Their commitment to excellence shines in every aspect of the organization, from onboarding to competitive pay and generous benefits. At the same time, CBL expects the same level of dedication and work ethic from its employees. But that’s easy to deliver when you work for a company that genuinely supports you, values your input, and stands behind your decisions. The work is challenging—this is not a company for slackers—but it’s rewarding. About a month ago, when the mall I worked at went on the market and was sold, I was initially devastated. Typically, when a mall changes ownership, the staff either transitions to the new owners or is left in a precarious position. After only 8 months in my role, I feared losing CBL as my employer. However, I reached out to HR to express my interest in staying with the company, and to my surprise and gratitude, they went above and beyond to retain me. Despite being new, they recognized my situation and offered to transfer me to a mall in another state. This level of care and support is something I’ve never experienced with a management company. The benefits CBL provides are incredible—almost entirely employer-paid, generous paid time off, and an exceptional work-life balance. The management team is phenomenal, with centuries of combined experience, and my boss is hands-down amazing. The pay is on the higher end of the spectrum, if not the highest, and everyone I’ve worked with LOVES this company. It’s no wonder employees stay for 20+ years. In fact, I’ve heard of many who left to try other companies, only to return months later because the grass is simply not greener on the other side. This review is completely unsolicited—I’m writing it because I feel compelled to share how great this company is. If you are top talent, this is a company you must work for. As long as you do your job, they will always show up with your check and have your back. CBL is, without a doubt, the best company I’ve worked for. I trust and value my coworkers implicitly—they’re not only great people but also immensely talented in their fields. I couldn’t ask for a better employer or a better team.",None-- and I love to complain,CBL Properties,CBL,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CBL-and-Associates-Properties-Reviews-E2378.htm

They will tout how important family is, however, they have no compunction about forcing work/travel on weekends without giving any comp time in exchange, which is just silly. I truly feel that the only reason one of the larger developers haven't done a take over of this company is that it would be too much work to sell the 50 ugly properties in order to secure the 15 solid ones and the 25 so-so ones.

Clerical Assistant,1.0,"Aug 25, 2018","Exceptional design and cleanliness to the Columbia office building. The CEO there at the time Mr. Griffin was very personable, smart and diligent.","This was by far my worst job ever. I was offered a job as a low-level clerical assistant working with the two teams, the legal department and investments team. This was my first full time job straight out of college and I absolutely dreaded coming to work everyday. I would go weeks without seeing my manager for the investments team, so many worked and assisted the legal team. The assist I worked under was the executive assistant to the VP of Legal and she did nothing but all day but suck up to her boss while talking about her behind her back and boss me around. She treated me very awful, and would raise her voice to me over little things I did wrong to the point where I would go home crying every day. But, at the same time I felt bad for her because she would be treated twice as as worse by the VP, so most days I let it go. The remaining members of the legal team I worked under were extremely pretentious, rude and unprofessional. I left after only 6 months of being employed there and I decided to resign after I met with my two bosses VP of Legal and VP of Investments for my three month performance evaluation, which conveniently took place 5 months into my employment. At that time they decided to advise me that my performance was subpar and I was taking too much time off from work, mind you I had braces on at that time and needed to visit the Orthodontist pretty often. They explained I was negative and rude to my counterparts, and at that time they were probably right because I had had enough with my coworkers yelling at me and treating me that way. Needless to say I finally got out, six months too long. I’ve had several jobs since that one and no other job I’ve ever been in has ever come close to how bad this one was.",COPT Defense Properties,CDP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Corporate-Office-Properties-Trust-Reviews-E5027.htm

Decisions are reactive, not proactive, and often made without transparency or input from those closest to the work.

Recognition, advancement, and compensation are not aligned with performance. Employees are expected to take on strategic initiatives or larger projects and scope of work with no end date in sight and without formal acknowledgment or pay equity.

Close to home,3.0,"Oct 7, 2023",Work is very close to home and my supervisor is probably the best supervisor I’ve ever had. He is very flexible with my hours being i and a single father who has split custody so some days I have to come in late or i am unable to stay late when it’s busy. But he also knows that I will come in in the middle of the night of on the weekends to finish repairs so we have enough truck to get the freight where it needs it to go on time.,Being it it a publicly traded company it is much more difficult to order and stock parts me need to do our jobs. Also tools for the shop that the employer would normally provide either never get purchased or a technician has to refuse to repair a machine/ truck until they have the proper tools for safety reasons. This is not at fault of our shop supervisor but more of the hoops that they would Have to Jump Through to get such purchases approved. Since americold purchased halls warehouses over 2 years ago we still have yet to receive a parts washer so we are forced to use far more brake clean than would be normally used. Not only a waste of money but a hit to employee health and safety. Also understaffing is a huge problem. I have a few friends who I would have apply but the income offers are laughable sometimes. I feel like if you pay good wages you will Get the people who want to work and take pride in it. And you can easily weed out the people who don’t want the money. But It just in our department that is understaffed but everywhere it seems. I have tried numerous times to get my child support payments taken out of payroll before direct deposit with no luck. Even been arrested and released due to this issue. But I also understand that the HR rep that I have has a lot of other people she is responsible for and things slip through the cracks. I do love working here and the people i directly work with but we were promised apt when americold took over like all brand new tools and lunches every month and much more and we haven’t seen any of it. And might I add when corporate reps came around after the acquisition of halls they talked a good game they said we brought each of u a gift… it was hats and water bottles. But they didn’t bring enough for everyone… that right there kinda set the tone. I did receive a raise when they took over which was nice but it was nowhere near what I was offer at other companies 2 years prior coming out of technical school.

In the long run, Americold will have a well integrated and competitive operation. There are some good learning opportunities for many people along the way.","A private equity company named Yucaipa calls the shots and Yucaipa is run by billionaire Ron Burkle. The strategy a few years ago was to invest, grow, and go public. The Versacold acquisition added a lot of debt and antiquated systems. The investment was made but the growth didn't follow, in part because of the economy. Going public turned out not to be an option. The management team that initiated and was executing the strategy has been fired or has quit and been replaced by a team that is charged with a strategy of cutting cost, leveraging the company with debt, and returning more profit to Yucaipa. This is why there have been layoffs the last couple of years and a difficult work environment for those that remain. Yucaipa certainly has a right to recoup their investment, but this will be difficult for the employees and customers to handle over the next few years.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

Mediocrity At Its Best,2.0,"Nov 19, 2014",My co-workers were good people to be around. There was room for growth early on. Tuition reimbursement option is a plus for students.,"Leadership has no vision. Leadership cares not about the culture or morale of the employees. Workload is not equivalent to the pay unless you are VP or above, and then the paradigm shifts in the other direction. Appreciation is only communicated in a halfhearted verbal method, and never interprets into pay increases or other benefits. ""Merit Increase"" program is actually an annual across-the-board cost of living increase. No matter how much merit you bring to the table, you will often see the same increase as some of your lazier and less-motivated counterparts. The Human Resources team is a toxic group with multiple agendas and unchecked power. They are very intrusive, manipulative and controlling. I worked for Americold for more than 5 years, and built tons of good personal relationships - NO ONE LIKES THEIR JOB. I have never heard anyone brag on this company, or defend it when someone else bashes it.

Health care is good for what you contribute each month.,"As a supervisor you are salaried 50 hours a week, this equates to less than an houlry wage of the people you are supervising. Because the headquarters are in Atlanta, I don't feel the company values trickle down to the facilities. Alot of focus is given on customer service, which is great for job security, but the employees are not recognized for the sacrifice.

Stay far away from this company,1.0,"Nov 6, 2021",There are zero pros to working for this company.,"No leadership. No training, you have to try to figure it out. If you’re in any supervisor or manager position, they expect you to work from 5am to 10-11pm with no additional compensation. They have a revolving door of temporary workers so they don’t have to invest in hiring anyone. Absolutely terrible employee treatment. Upper management will yell at anyone in front of other staff. Front line employees are treated as expendable and replaceable. Sexual harassment investigations are not followed through with HR, they claim they investigate it but take no action when multiple people are filing claims against the same person. Women are treated as gophers and expected to cater to General Managers on any whim they may have. If you try to take a day off, you are harassed by management and told you are not a “team player”. Then they will call you multiple times on your day off and tell you that you have to come in, or you will get fired - even if you’ve stated that you have consumed alcohol and cannot drive. Personal and confidential employee information is easily accessible, often times it’s left in folders around the office or just thrown in the trash can with no shredding. There is no long term plan for anything. I could go on and on but this is the most toxic work environment I have encountered in 20+ years of working.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

Most employees loose 20-30lbs within a few months.","There are too many cons to list, so here's my top three. One can easily hurt themselves in this environment. Slips, trips, and falls are common. The organization lacks the man power to keep the floors clean. Ice cubes are everywhere, and one single ice cube can take you out permanently. Broken open boxes of food are everywhere, and everything is frozen, adding to slipping hazards. The equipment (pallet jacks) operate poorly, forcing you to strain when steering. There incentive program allows employees to make $4.00 an hour more if they exceed the formulated performance level by 35%, in other words, working at a rate equal to 135% effective. Mathematically, the extra 35% effort is rewarded at less than the starting wage. The company benefits greatly by paying an incentive vs. OT Finally, after injuring my back, I found the company's HR department completely disregard all my emails, phone calls, and requests to further investigate my particular circumstances. Fairness and Openness are two of the company's core values.

First, the work area where I am situated is right in front of the copier (Legal, 5th FL, corporate office, ATL, GA). Therefore, it is noisy when the printer is being used, people are in and out and talk REALLY LOUD as if I am not there. If I am taking a conf. call or trying to concentrate, it makes for a hard time. I've asked for a better spot, but no results yet. Secondly, I wasn't aware until my orientation day that the PTO is only 2 weeks, to include vacation AND sick time/personal time. I would expect that if PTO vs Vacation/sick time, the company would provide 15 days (3 weeks) at a minimum. There is not work life balance when an employee cant use at least one full week of vacation (deducting sick time, dr. appts, etc, there's not much left). Lastly, they need to increase the number of company holidays. For ex, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas eve, MLK (which is a national holiday so not sure why we aren't observing it). Offering the option to tele-commute once a week would also help. Most progressive companies allow this and it enhances employee moral.

God forbid you park your lift to use the restroom for 2 minutes. Or find an inventory error and have to drive out to the inventory (every 20 minutes this happened) to have those guys belittle you as well. The work was horrible. Case pick and full pallet pick all mixed together, from anywhere in the warehouse. Whatever pick you pull up on your screen, you must complete it. No freedom or control whatsoever of inventory or pick orders. You can't chsnge the location of anything in the warehouse. There are some orders where you have to scan each individual case on the full pallet. Sometimes you have to tear apart the entire skid to scan each case so the weight of the cases can be entered into the system. There is an option where you can enter the full weight of the skid manually into the system without having to do all this work, but of course the inventory guys won't let you do it. The other people who worked there were very rude. Probably because their job sucks. Everyone drove their lifts like idiots. There was NO safety involved. They preached safety at the orientation but no where did I see it when I got out to the floor.

Some people in middle management will smile in your face then speak very negatively of you when they think you're not listening and will directly impede your work efforts if collaboration is needed. No cups in the break room. The workload is unapologetically unreasonable. Most people are working the jobs of an entire team on their own and they are not happy about it. Of course, they begin to lash out and develop poor attitude after being overworked by the company. During the review season, employees are encouraged to not rate themselves too high, making it easier to justify waiting ""another year"" for a promotion. Continued growth and development is not really supported because they are afraid that employees will grow too much and take your skills elsewhere. A few key people are committing mass exodus due to the place being run so poorly. No sick days. It is mixed with PTO and there is not a lot of it.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

Toxic Workplace and an HR Nightmare,1.0,"Aug 4, 2022",Hardworking people. But not much of anything positive to share.,"HR, middle management, and upper management at the plant are incompetent, unprofessional, and lack empathy and people skills to properly lead a healthy and positive work culture. Good luck trying to use your earned PTO while being interrogated with questions on what you are using your PTO for (it's no one's business). Using sick hours is almost impossible since you get bullied for pretending to be ""sick"" when it is apparent. How this is sanitary and safe for a food storage facility is beyond me. They are constantly understaffed due to the lack of quality hires and no one being able to withstand the toxic culture longterm. People are hardworking and push themselves to the point of exhaustion, health complications, and lack of self care and mental health, and I have witnessed so many employee deaths during my time here. Many women I have worked with have been harassed, but the agressor do not face any consequences. Instead, management will ask if you have done anything to provoke their behavior and advances. This is definitely the good ol' boys' club culture. If you value your mental and physical health, especially if you are a woman, I highly reccomend you find another company or industry that values your safety and wellness.",Americold Realty Trust,COLD,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Americold-Logistics-Reviews-E33145.htm

No Work Life Balance,1.0,"Jan 14, 2023",Hiring process was seamless and fast. Plenty of lighting in the warehouse. Most workers willing to help and answer any questions. Store and fast food right down the street for breaks.,"Inventory issues: Many racks/bays missing labels making location overrides difficult. Item not is designated locations and often in Bay above or below or either side or not at all. When doing directed work go to location and item is not there. Item is behind front pallet. why is system having us take 1 to 2 pallets down to get to one pallet very inefficient. Sometimes second pallet is also incorrect very frustrating. Missing pallets could be above below to the right or left or in/at end the aisles it’s a huge problem. Facilities Maintenance Issues: Battery Changing Room has dozens of bays without chargers. Labels don't make any sense.  Older batteries don't last nearly as long and new batteries are hit or miss 70-90% cap. No battery staged on carriage after changing.  Most batteries are lacking proper maintenance and look like they are in bad shape.  Deteriorating hoses, valves, caps, & wires… Floor is cracked and uneven throughout facility especially at cooler entryways. Damaged racking Men’s locker room is a mess and deteriorating. Many toilets and sinks not working. System Issues: When staging wall locations don't work with wireless scanners requiring hand input for staging. Confirmation/acknowledge screen lacks last 4 numbers of order number. Wired scanners continuously mis-scan due to the amount of bar codes all in one spot. Wireless scanners are difficult to pair to vmu LTO are not credentialed to make changes to vmu. Can't even get to Bluetooth settings to pair scanner because IT has vmu locked down running login log-on scripts preventing users from accessing basic settings and apps like clock/calc. Ridiculous! When scanning staging area codes with wireless scanner you get the wrong input data. When scanning with wired after successful scan goes to case field instead of quantity field. After scanning an invalid pallet and setting the pallet aside then scanning correct pallet the system adds a zero to the field. Should be able to scan...field gets cleared...new number is input in to field. Paper inspections instead of computerized like iwarehouse. In 2 deep racks there will be two different products and system will ask you to get the deep pallet instead of face pallet. This system issues is the worst imo…let's say Red Prairie asks you to go to a 4 deep bulk bay to get a pallet that has 79 instead of 80 that pallet could literally be anywhere in that bay so you go to a cooler bulk bay and the pallet could be on any level a-f front middle rear. You have to go digging to find it! Process Issues: A few times per shift there will be tags on the product that are considered dead tags...third party reprint and still doesn't work requiring you to manually type in and re label. Evidently this happens because personnel unloading trucks neglected to re-label. Then they putaway by manually entering the number. So when you get assigned to pick that pallet you are not able to scan. Having to fill out slip for every pallet despite all the same product/order. Having to get off the lift several times throughout the shift to scan a pallet because the tags are not in correct location or behind wrap or non existent. Quality of life/work life balance: Can't have coffee coco unless you're on break yet coffee maker and coco packets are in control room not break room. After being in the -10 cooler for a couple hours back and forth would be nice to have access to hot beverage or heated room for several minutes that doesn't count against breaks. Floor suspension does not provide shock and vibration protection on several lifts causing knee and back pain. No notice for extended shift. Do not adhere to set schedule. They expect people to work 6 days a week 11 hours per shift with an unpaid lunch. In the beginning they will lie to get you to work for them claiming 4on 4off $26 an hour easy to get the incentive. It’s all lies! Expect same amount of work with half the personnel. No incentive unless list picking you'll average -30% to -40% if doing replenishment, putaways, staging outbounds. Expect to be at  -40% to -20% with all the inventory issues, dumped pallets, incorrect or missing pallets, having to wait on other LTO's to list pick...On a good day you might hit 0. They claim it's possible to reach +15% which would be the $24.50 plus 1.50 night differential but I doubt it. With all of the inventory and system issues you'll rarely hit +15% and if you were to hit that percentage consistently they'll make accusations of cheating the system. I have 3 years reach truck experience and 6 total forklift experience and never hit +15%. Best percentage based on reports was -32% and that was with me running all the stop signs and horn blaring! Management issues: Supervisors spend majority of shift in office. Managers have no idea what's going on totally oblivious. Blame game for anything and everything. I’ve never worked at a warehouse that had a general manager…what for?! Supervisor mistreated everyone spent entire shift in office not doing anything.

Better Every Days,5.0,"May 27, 2025","Starting a new job can be a little nerve-wracking, but my experience with Centerspace has been nothing short of incredible. From day one, I've felt supported, valued, and genuinely welcomed. One of the biggest pros has been the flexibility in working style—there’s a strong sense of trust here, and you’re encouraged to work in a way that brings out your best. What truly sets this company apart is its leadership team. They're not only accessible but also incredibly open to new ideas and different ways of doing things. It’s refreshing to be part of an organization where innovation is encouraged and your voice matters. You’re empowered to think boldly and “Dare to Win”—an approach that creates a dynamic and energizing work environment. I’ve also had the chance to challenge myself and grow in ways that are both exciting and rewarding. The work is engaging, and I’ve already learned so much in just a short time. On top of that, my co-workers have been amazing—friendly, genuine, and eager to build connections. There’s a shared commitment to getting “Better Every Days,” and that mindset shows up in both individual efforts and team collaboration. The culture is warm and welcoming, and that starts from the top. Even our CEO, Anne, took the time to personally reach out to see how my first few weeks were going. It’s clear that people come first here. The leadership team checks in regularly and truly wants to hear from us—not just in group settings but on a personal level too. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful to be part of such a thoughtful, forward-thinking company. It’s a place where people and progress go hand in hand, and where we’re all encouraged to grow, innovate, and make every day better.","As with any new role, there’s always a learning curve—and for me, the most significant one has been getting up to speed with the technology platforms used at Centerspace. While each system has its strengths, I’ve noticed that not all platforms fully integrate with one another, which can lead to some manual work to ensure consistency and alignment across different tools. This has been a great opportunity for me to better understand the current processes, and I appreciate the transparency and support from my team as I’ve navigated through it. At the same time, I see a real opportunity for process improvement, particularly in exploring how AI could be leveraged at a system level to streamline workflows, reduce manual tasks, and improve overall efficiency. I’m excited to see how technology can evolve here, and I’m confident that, given the company’s openness to innovation and continuous improvement, these enhancements are not only possible but well within reach.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Culturally, having worked for multiple Multi-Family Housing Companies, CenterSpace talks the talk, and walks the walk. Support is amazing & every employee I've reached out to has been happy to lend a hand whenever necessary. One of their keys, is ""One Team"", which means that although we all work at our individual properties, we're one company and we are all on the same team. It's not just a key, or a hashtag, it's actually true.","Depending on the position, days can be heavy. We deal with the 4 most important things in peoples lives: their homes, pets, cars & money. That's not necessarily a con for the company but the industry. As managers, it's not a 24-hour job in reality, but it does feel like it. Only other item would be that due to the size of the teams, staffing is sometimes difficult without enough bodies to fill in.

Messy,1.0,"Mar 31, 2023","Endless funds to spend on the residents and staff, there's apparently no max to the party budget","Management doesn't care about Fair Housing or EEOC at all. There's a huge problem with fraternization. Lots of hooking up, drinking, and partying with the residents. Staff members get really cliquey with residents and are unable to impartially implement Fair Housing. One resident sexually harassed another resident at the pool, and when the victim complained, the manager said the victim was being sensitive and not understanding the perpetrator's humor (she was friends with perp). She refused to file an incident report. One teammate was regularly hooking up with a resident who was going through Eviction. It's unethical and convoluted. The exposure for a lawsuit is crazy high. It's like going back to high school in the worst way. If you don't go along with the status quo, you're told you're not a ""culture fit"" and your teammates will shun you like in The Crucible.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Industry Leader,5.0,"Feb 23, 2021","When I reflect on my time with Centerspace I can say with complete confidence that this company has helped me grow into a strong leader, mentor and really pathed my way to the successes I have experienced. They have a strong sense of their one team mantra and are adaptable to change laying the path to becoming a industry leader in property management. They took any obstacle over this last year and turned it into a learning experience, kept a positive outlook on every situation and really supported their employees through the ever changing times. I’m speaking out of first hand knowledge being at our Urban properties during COVID and the Civil Unrest in the communities my properties are in, they made the residents and employees safety and care a first priority. They made their appreciation known through listening to what we needed and what residents needed and acted on it instead of only thinking about the bottom line. The ability to work for such a excellent leadership team has shown me what working for a company should be, you should have work/life balance and time off, you should be heard and cared for and most importantly you should have the opportunity to grow and be given opportunities to show your passion, Centerspace gives you all of that and more.",There are none I can point out.,Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Unvalued employee,1.0,"Apr 10, 2018","Some positives would be the good hours, stable` pay, and the insurance. I love my residents so much and they are the only reason that I have been able to last this long in such a toxic environment.","It does not matter how hard you work, you will NEVER be recognized for it. They say they hire up within the company, however I have seen on numerous occasions, perfectly qualified, hard workers not even being considered with no good reason as to why. Corporate, upper management is completely untouchable, it does not matter what they do or how they treat people, nothing will ever change. I have seen employee turnover after turnover because of the regional manager and it doesn't seem to be looked at. It has been made very clear to everyone currently employed under them that nothing will change, and we have been told to go ahead and find a new job. IRET does NOT care about their employees in any way shape or form. They also do not offer a very high discount on rent, considering most property management companies offer free housing to employees. The pay is also considerably lower than competing properties. It has been empty promise, after promise.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

They’ve implemented so many different things since I started. All which require online training. But they only give a week or two until something happens. You could be gone on vacation and come back and everything is different. They also claim to value costumer service, but between management being rude to residents all the time, the constant price hikes in amenities (garages going up 40% in one year), and only covering heat instead of any other utilities is obvious they are only interested in making money. Also, if you’re part time, your benefits suck. Only the discount of rent. Nothing else.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm

Opportunities abound with this company, and they are always on the look out for people with a “can do” attitude.

Poor Manager,1.0,"Feb 4, 2013","Some good, engaged people at corporate but much apathy and laziness exists within this company","I guess I should have been more concerned during my interview when my future manager said ""one thing this company doesn't do well is train people"". I assumed she would train me but evidently she couldn't be bothered. I don't know if it is a regional problem in Billings or it is the culture throughout the company but IRET Properties does not treat its people well.

Potentially a person can being working as a leasing agent or in maintenance.,"Sometimes it can be lonely as stated before but that is really a characteristic of the job in general and not a reflection of the company. I suggest getting some audio books and listening to them while you work. However, I can go through about 3 audio books a week which can make this practice expensive.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Mismanagement,1.0,"Dec 26, 2018",I will have to say that Pay is a factor to accepting a position with IRET.,"It may not be for each location, but mismanagement is a massive factor in my location. One thing is said to one employee, another is said to the next employee across the office; information essential to job performance is not given to be passed along to residents asking questions. Micro-managing is a culture practiced to full extent and there is an atmosphere of dictator, my-way-or-the-highway attitude. Training is null and I am lost in the realm of this money-hungry company. I could perform my duties much better if I had adequate training. With a lot of actions and miscommunication, there are a lot of Human Resource mal-practices going on.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
I will always recommend IRET,5.0,"Sep 10, 2020",IRET genuinely cares about their employees and their families. They took every precaution when COVID 19 had started and continues to do so. They allowed their teams to work remotely. They've made their voice clear regarding justice and equality. I am so proud to be able to work for a company that is so passionate in standing for what is right. They also even give out quarterly bonuses + even random ones. The senior team is very involved and you feel like a work family. Their training is extremely thorough and hands on. You will feel very confident jumping in after training. There is plenty of room to grow within the company and even to transfer out of state. I cannot recommend IRET enough!,You may have to work some nights or weekends.

I’m approaching a 1 year anniversary with this company and am extremely satisfied with my decision of employment.",Dealing with angry tenants has its downside and in my opinion is the hardest part of the job. Some people just let the smallest thing turn into the end of the world. You have to have the right kind of temperament for this position. On a positive note the company offers training that can help you cope with this situation.,Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Dead End Job with Poor Management,2.0,"Jun 20, 2014","My coworkers are some of the best people around, but sadly are one of the only positive things about working for this company.","There is little to no room for advancement within the company. At times when more advanced positions have been open they have tended to hire outside the company rather than giving opportunity to existing staff members. Benefits have been slashed and salary is below market. Work as hard as you like, but there is little chance you will be recognized for it. Your reward will be yet more work, but with no pay increase. Executive management consists of a tight knit group of people that is holding the company back from what it could be.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Community Manager,1.0,"Jan 8, 2019",This was a really great company prior to new upper management coming in.,"The new management team controls every aspect of your day, they micromanage and clearly do not communicate with each other because they all tell you something different. You don’t have the ability to provide your own input or feedback. There is no room for growth within the company because they fill all the positions with people from outside the company that know someone. Your hard work is never recognized, no matter how dedicated you are to the company. You get little to no say in your budget, even though you are on expected to run the property. They also continually pile more work on you and don’t offer adequate staffing. Regional managers are non existent, they “work from home” and are rarely available. A lot of sketchy things happen and heads are turned the other way, no one is held accountable.",Centerspace,CSR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Centerspace-Reviews-E641383.htm
Property Management,1.0,"Mar 17, 2020",I was lucky to get out when I did.,"This is —hands down— the worst job I’ve ever had in the property management industry. I was emotionally neglected by the boss that hired me, bulldozed by my on-site management, and was publicly humiliated by the head bosses that hired me. As a queer person, I figured this was the most progressive company I could work for in the area. I never anticipated that not only would I be shunned, but publicly humiliated by the team that hired me after I turned in my notice. I would hire an attorney if I had the time and energy to fight the lawsuit. Turns out? I wasn’t the only one with bad experience. There’s a clear pattern.

PTO is decent (14 days I believe), plus 8 or 9 paid holidays.","Toxic work environment. Upper management doesn't care what feedback they get from site teams. If you say anything negative you ""don't believe in the product"". They don't trust site teams to do what needs to be done so they gatekeep everything and prolong any necessary process.

This is the kind of person Centerspace promotes. She got promoted last year and promoted the person that sucked up to her the most that had no idea what they were doing at their job.

They show great promise and continued growth. They totally dominate most of the markets that they are in.,"Located in Buckhead, where traffic is a nightmare but they're right on the buckhead marta station. The employee review process was broken. Your bonus was not based on how well you performed. It was tied directly to the company's overall performance, which actually wasn't the worst thing since the company had done well while I was there. But the issue was that your performance review literally did not matter. We had the ability to work from home but were rarely allowed. I don't know if this has changed since I've left. Most people on the accounting side were unhappy and starting to look for other jobs by the time I had left. Lots of people spent their entire careers at the company and were overlooked for senior positions, which were given to outside hires.

3 Year Analyst Program - Great foundation,5.0,"Apr 15, 2016",I went through DRH's 3 year analyst program after graduating from undergrad. It was a great place to start my career and build a foundation of knowledge in the hospitality / real estate industry. Upper management took an active interest in my development and got me involved in multiple facets of the company. Loved the team environment. Exit opportunities were solid and the C-level execs were very helpful with advice and recommendations when my analyst program was coming to an end.,Nothing major comes to mind.

Diamond Rocks!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2016","DiamondRock is a real estate company focused on the hospitality industry. The basic function of the company, to own hotels, is an exciting premise. I mean, who wouldn’t want an occupation that is the real-life equivalent of the Monopoly Man? The hotel business is an industry that is rooted in taking care of hotels that, in turn, take care of employees and travelers. It is an industry that has a meaningful impact on the daily lives of many people. The company is very well organized and operations run smoothly. The team is talented and motivated, with employees working hard to continue to help grow the company. DiamondRock is also a responsible corporate citizen and a great member of the Bethesda community by offering opportunities for employees to participate in local community service initiatives (also, read on to discover my notes about Bethesda later). The executives of the company are very approachable. The company prides itself on good communication, and it is easy to speak with the company’s key leaders. The executives make it a priority to ensure that all employees are aware of major directives, projects and goals. Also, the executives have an open door policy for questions, which is pretty cool. Now on to the important stuff. There is a snack room with unlimited, bottomless, snacks and soda (at least three types of pretzels at all times)! If you want to set a new personal best for afternoon soda consumption, there will be nothing stopping you. There’s even a really high-tech coffee machine that I’m convinced you can only operate if your previous employer was NASA. Also, there are a variety of entertaining informal and formal social events that help employees get to know each other in a more informal setting. And now to address a slightly controversial topic, the office’s location in Bethesda. Since the good folks at Glassdoor.com do not have a category for items that have both positive and negative attributes (NOTE TO GLASSDOOR: create a category for things that are boths pro's and con's), I’m placing this squarely into the positive attribute category. Pro because there are many hospitality industry companies in Bethesda, which creates a lot of networking opportunities. Pro because DiamondRock’s office occupies the best location in Bethesda, right on top of the Bethesda Metro Station (Red Line), and within three blocks of about 100 shops and restaurants (note, this is an approximate count and probably cannot be relied upon as an official statistic). Con because you are not in city-center Washington, DC. Bethesda is a small city where the majority of the workforce departs the area after the workday has concluded. However, Bethesda does have its perks if you need to finish up some last minute holiday shopping, replace an I-phone that you recently dropped while swimming in a lake, or find a tailor to mend your suit because your best friend decided to elope and only provided you with three days’ notice (it happened).","Although DiamondRock is a mid-cap public company traded on the NYSE, the workforce does not consist of that many people. Choosing to work at a small versus a large company is a lot like choosing to attend a liberal arts college or venture to State U. At a small college, everybody knows your name while at a large school you have the benefit of complete anonymity until a professor finally inquires where you have been all semester. Just note that at DiamondRock you won’t find an internal intranet with postings for 500 open positions, but you also won’t be required to attend a two-month training program at some spooky Upstate New York corporate campus.",DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
Three Year Analyst Program,5.0,"May 3, 2016",Amazing leadership and professional development in the three year analyst program!

The company and analyst team culture created an fun and comfortable workplace while the work was dynamic and challenging.,"None really.

Smoke and Mirrors... be careful,1.0,"Oct 28, 2025",There weren't too many things I liked about the organization other than meeting some cool people. The bright minds tended to be younger and most often would leave eventually. The salary was competitive... but benefits were pretty meh.,"Probably the most bizarre place I've ever worked. The constant stress of project deadlines that were deemed urgent, micro-managers and directors, executives being extremely toxic and overall just a weird sense of everyone being on edge at all times. They say they care about employee well being, but in the end most of the people that stay for more than a few years are just 'yes' people who play the corporate game. Most of the bright young minds leave after a few years (rightfully so) I often had to bite my tongue in response to how my manager and director would speak to me when something wasn't working as expected. The WFH is a joke.. they say 6 days a month but that comes with caveats... no 2 days in a row, has to have manager approval, can't come before a holiday or after a weekend... it wasn't flexible at all. Additionally, every team is extremely under-staffed... the amount of project requests that would come in.. the team I worked within never had enough time to complete anything with real quality, as it was a mad rush to get it out the door. The firm was extremely wary of hiring more people, yet executive level salaries were insane... just food for thought. Unless you are unemployed or have no other job prospects, I'd carefully consider other opportunities. Obviously everyone's experience is different.. but in a nutshell this was the worst place I ever worked at (my perspective)",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Good Entry Level Job,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Benefits are (were) the best I've experienced in the industry. Plus it's cool to say you work for the company that owns the ""world's most famous building"".","So, I've had the privilege of working at a worse company and a company on par with (or a little better than) ESRT. If you're right out of college, looking for an entry level property management job to spend a couple of years at to get your resume going (because you will not get promoted, not matter how good you are. Rewarding good work or hiring from within is not their jam) you could do worse. The benefits are really good, actually. Although, they changed their bonus structure in order to deny or lower bonuses arbitrarily and they switched their insurance to a lower quality one right as I left, so I can't speak to how the benefits are now. Bottom line--you have to remember that this is a corporation in AMERICA, of all places. They don't care about you beyond if you're losing or making them money, no matter how many free bagel days or lunches they give you. At the end of the day, they will sell your building to make a buck and kick you to the curb with a backdated termination letter (so that they don't have to pay for your insurance, of course), a callous denial of severance (even though they gave all other buildings severance before you), and not even a thank you or goodbye meal (upper management didn't even email the people whose lives they were upending despite knowing them for 10+ years), whether you've worked there for 2 years or 20. In fact, you're probably treated better if you've only been there for 2 years because the CEO or whatever his nepo baby title is has some kind of obsession with Gen Z and doesn't respect lifers. And everyone is TERRIFIED of him so no one will fight on your behalf if they risk going against him. So, yeah. It's a fine place to work if you don't expect to get a lot out of it.

Incompetent, incapable, and completely useless. The HR department experienced nearly 100% turnover since 2015. Everyone with talent in that department left. Pay increases, bonuses and payroll is horrendous and run by an incompetent manager. There is a huge lack of union and employee knowledge within the HR department.

Growth In the Right Direction,4.0,"May 10, 2019","I've been with ESRT for about a year now, serving in a variety of different capacities that have allowed me to witness multiple facets of what it's like to be an employee here. In my experience, there are two pros that stand out the most that have made it a great place to work for me: 1. A Challenging Environment - As mentioned in some of the other reviews here, when you put yourself out there at ESRT, you are rewarded with increasing professional and educational opportunities. I have found that management has consistently challenged me to go above and beyond and learn new things in my professional life. I've been given the opportunity to take great initiative on projects despite not being here for that long, simply because I've spoken up about wanting to be more involved. There are many opportunities for growth here at ESRT and professional improvement is actively encouraged by management. I have yet to be bored here. Obviously, this can vary by department, but I can say that I have been met with overwhelming support and encouragement from management in my department to grow professionally since I started here. 2. Increasingly Receptive Management - I have played witness to a good amount of institutional change here over the last year, all of which has ultimately been very encouraging to see as an employee. Management has been making an increasing effort to listen and respond to the concerns and desires of employees, which has manifested in a steadily growing number of ""office perks"" and the founding of a Culture Committee, as well as a general feeling of an overall culture shift within the organization as management learns to be a bit more relaxed and open to trying new things. Within the span of a year, I feel like management has gone from being very stuffy, close-minded, and out-of-touch to really being in touch with employees and actively engaged in finding new ways to improve the experience of working here at ESRT, which has been great to see and very reassuring. Aside from the aforementioned, I have also had a very positive experience with the work environment itself, and the people who work here. The job respects a work-life balance, the people are incredibly friendly and passionate about what they do, and the office itself is very upscale and conducive to collaboration and interaction among employees. I really do enjoy coming here every day!","Despite its recent progress, the organization is still very reliant on a top-down style of management which has allowed a very bureaucratic environment to thrive. My main frustrations with working here stem from: 1. A Heavy Dependence on Email - My inbox is inundated around the clock thanks to a culture of reliance on email as a primary mode of communication. Slack is not a universally-used application in our office, nor do we use any other sort of IM service for communication. I think this is definitely something that could be improved on in order to reduce inbox clutter and increase efficiency. 2. Lengthy Approval Processes - As I said above, the bureaucracy of the organization is most apparent when trying to accomplish tasks that require several levels of approval. It is understandable to have procedures in place to reduce the company's liability, however there is a such thing as too much. It is not uncommon to spend a great amount of time on a project only for it to be stymied by lengthy approval processes.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Good Pay / Bad Vibes,2.0,"May 26, 2022",Great pay and benefits package,Hosts are undervalued and treated as replaceable. There aren’t any options for progression. All supervisors are sourced out - meaning most don’t have the knowledge that a lot of the staff have. The building is frustrating and inefficient. There are no women in supervisor positions. There is a “boys club” atmosphere where men frequently talk about the attractiveness of the female guests and employees. They’ve used derogatory terms to refer to female guests and employees.,Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

Tyrannical Totalitarianism at its Best!,1.0,"Jun 10, 2015","Culture, what culture? If tyrannical totalitarianism is the culture you are striving for, this is the company to work for! The individuals working at the Empire State Building and its Observatory are some of the most talented professionals in the industry. Their other properties... not so much.","HR, like most professions, values ethical principles. People are the most important asset of an organization but also its biggest potential liability. One would assume that HR is ethically responsible for promoting and fostering fairness and justice for all employees throughout the organization; however, ESRT’s disparate, discriminatory, and retaliatory practices make HR’s position within the organization obsolete. The greatest liabilities in the organization are the individuals in charge of running it. The top-heavy tyrannical executive office is compiled of “bosses” not “leaders” (all of whom hate each other and refuse to communicate with each other). As Human Capital professionals and culture champions, you know something is deeply wrong with an organization when 80% of the HR department leaves in 6 months to go work for the company’s biggest competitors. The executive office chalks employee resignations up to those resigning as being “bad employees”. If resignations were coming from “bad employees”, I doubt your competitors would be hiring them at double their salaries. When resigning, expect to get shunned from senior management. It is pointless to put in 2 weeks’ notice. During the notice period, not a single person on the senior management team acknowledges your existence. My advice to existing staff is – Get out while you still have what’s left of your morals and dignity. Competitors are looking for your talent and are willing to equitability compensate you for it. My advice to prospective employees is – Unless you’re taking a position making $300K+ a year, its best to keep it moving. Even at $300K a year, employees are dropping like flies.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

Had a lot to say but not a clue on how to run a successful and thriving team. C-Suite doesn't seem to care and just enables the behavior. There is a deep dysfunction in the workplace. I am impressed at how well they do financially when the actual work environment l worked in was extremely toxic. Most people are unhappy. A lot of broken promises and you will be over worked and underpaid.

Toxic with High Turnover - Stay Away,1.0,"Sep 27, 2014","Attractive Galleria location. Frequent ""Ordering-In"" of dinner (explained below), and jean fridays.","Extremely high turnover in the Accounting / Finance area (especially Corporate office). No work life balance. Unfortunately, accomplishment is measured on how many hours you put in (not the actual work performed). Dinner is ordered in just about every night and it's a big deal if you leave before 7pm (this is considered early). Employee morale is as low as I've witnessed at any organization of this size. Most people who are still hanging around are just waiting for their share grants to vest before they bolt. The joke of the place is that it's akin to Shawshank Prison (yes the movie). Existing employees actually joke when they see new hires join the team as they take bets on how many weeks the new person will last. **Last note - the financial systems are disjointed relics of the past. Running legacy software that is over 15 years old. It's really nothing short of a circus. If you are a candidate thinking of joining HHC, join at your own risk. My advice would be to make sure you ask them very detailed questions during the interview (and don't accept an offer until they let you interview with a couple peer level employees). Ask them pointed questions about the high rate of turnover (i.e.make them explain and defend it).

Shows that they are constantly looking to improve employee engagement with initiatives such as Hello Day and Discovery Tour.","In many ways, the company is still being run like a start up. The lack of processes (or illogical ones with 15 hoops to jump through) has crippled execution. When you are new, or even have been there for several years, and ask what certain processes are, you just get shoved around to several different departments with no definitive answer. Senior leadership needs to step up and set these in place. There is also no unified platform for employees to effectively communicate or share files (not even Slack), something they keep saying they're working on.

Any ideas are the bare minimum of creative with a ""throw it over the fence"" mentality and ambition is heavily discouraged.

Any attempt at departmental leadership comes off as clearly feigned and people are set up to fail constantly. Tonally it feels like you're working in finance and any perks of the office being pretty is clearly for clients, not employees. HHC tries in New York to be culturally relevant but often fails because there is very little creativity in its DNA.

I was experiencing that ""honeymoon phase"" at a new job where everything is just amazing. However, that started to fade out as I soon realized that actions spoke louder than words. The main reason why I left was that I was looking for career growth. My current role was not providing me the room to expand my experience or push my skill set to the max. Another reason I left was I essentially lived in fear of losing my job for over a year and a half for many reasons and to no fault of my own. – In June 2019 the company wanted to be purchased which meant looming potential layoffs if we merged with another company. – When no one wanted to buy the company they did a round of layoffs just before Thanksgiving and another just before the Holidays. – In March 2020 mainly due to COVID-19 they did another round of layoffs. I was fortunate to survive 3 rounds of layoffs, but it was scary waking up every day not knowing if I was next. Lastly, the culture is not what it is promised to be.

Communication is a failure at every level: meetings are held to distribute old, contradictory, or useless information, while useful information is kept secret and employees are challenged to prove why they need critical details to do their jobs. Meanwhile, the nepotistic patriarchy is kept alive and well by creating special positions for the sons of white leadership. Well-designed lip service is paid to social causes on social media (when the lawyers and financial projections have determined it’s safe) but take a look at the leadership – that will speak louder than any pretty, convenient words.

The others in the c-suite are a mixed lot with some attempting to communicate with those outside of the c-suite while others are focused on their own country club life. This company has fully embraced DEI and ESG to the point of ignoring just why they are even in business. Navigating around this is like picking your way through a minefield!

As far as my department, i feel like i got pretty lucky. I enjoy working in my teammates and I appreciate their patience with teaching me and showing me new things. I continue to learn something new every day here. And I definitely cannot forget to mention how AWESOME the CEO is. He is extremely generous and really cares about the employees at Hudson.

Great Company Culture and Work Life Balance,5.0,"Dec 9, 2021","The company culture is great. Team events, flexible when they need to be, listen to employee concerns, DEI training, and very organized. The accounting department is by far the best one I've worked with in the last 15 years in this business. They have a very robust and well put together training program and SOP's. If you don't know how to do something, they have an SOP on literally everything or someone who can help guide you.","Salaries and benefits need to be adjusted to industry standard. They are a little lower than other companies on the salary in my area. Also, benefits could be better. Other PM companies pay 100% of the insurance premium, but they cover a good portion.

Executive management team is all legacy employees from CEO’s previous companies. They recently bought all the tv/film transportation companies and then had to cut employees that actually provided money saving services. They are top heavy in management with overpaid mid managers that don’t have any idea on how to run tv/film studios. They promote playing favorites and don’t recognize the employees who work hard at their jobs. Management doesn’t promote based on true merit, they seem to only promote those who will just stay quite and fall inline. They will continue to make cuts so they can pay their overpaid managers and executives, all while cutting key money saving and revenue generating services they could provide if they knew how to use them.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

A start-up tech feel in a modern corporate culture,5.0,"Jun 17, 2016","The crux with sites like this is that everyone who is disgruntled or out for revenge is so quick to take to the “interweb” and air their grievances. Like Festivus is actually a real thing and they are so cleaver to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes and show how they were made a victim. In my lifetime of work experience, there’s always a valid reason why people are listed as “former” employees. A valid reason. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, perfectly happy, content employees are too busy doing their jobs to feel the need to broadcast to the world of how great they truly have it. Perhaps that’s a mistake on our part. One I intend to correct immediately. Hudson is not perfect. I have never met anyone here who has claimed otherwise. But, I have known that this company was special from the moment I stepped foot onto their property. Contrary to urban myth, there has never been a table of Kool-Aid set up for all new employees to drink. They don’t need to. The Kool-Aid is in the way the company is run, from the top-down. Open door policy? Check. Work-life balance? Check. Recognizing an employee’s commitment to go above and beyond? Check. Collaborative work force? Check. Perks? Check. Ability to grow? Check. I could go on and on here, but I think you get the picture. Hudson also has a very progressive mentality regarding change. They are not afraid to embrace it. Knowing that the past trends of the urban workforce may not be the most productive will never be set in stone with this company. The CEO is open to new things and excited to implement them. Like any job, I have my good days and my bad days. But, overall, they are mostly good and I’m incredibly fortunate and happy to be employed at Hudson.","It’s always a slippery slope when this subject is brought up, but there’s definitely a discrepancy in the XX to XY chromosome ratio in the senior management team. But let me clarify my, ahem, ""criticism"" for a moment. The current senior management team is comprised of amazing people with incredible talent who are truly shining stars in their respective roles. I don’t want to see more women in senior management to just fill a void. I also don’t want to see Hudson labeled as a “Boys Club” because it’s so much more than that. I want strong, intelligent and capable women to take more senior leadership roles alongside the current male heads of state.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

"Nice perks, bad management & HR",2.0,"Jun 16, 2017","Free lunches, free breakfast, good benefits, half day Fridays.","Hiring new people is a mess. They hire friends of management and executives, who don't actually want to work there, but get ridiculously high salaries. People who have been there for 10+ years have the job because they were there from the beginning, not because they are amazing employees. All of the interns that were hired were family or friends of executives, making it a nightmare to manage. TOTAL Boys club. Not many women can work there way to the top at HPP. HR is a disaster. Terrible, terrible HR staff. I've seen better HR management at small start-ups. There is no 'Open door policy' here, even though they want you to think there is. If you tell HR any concerns, they'll use it against you. If you're having any other issues, they will simply ignore you and not deal with situations. If there are any employees that are not meeting company standards, they simple demote them, and move them around the office, making the morale and work flow even worse. They do not know how to handle any problems or sticky situations, they'd rather ignore and cover it up with bandaids. Employee retention not great. A lot of turn over due to the extremely slow promotion rate. Again, you can get a promotion here easily if you know someone, if you are a ""random"" hire , hire based on skills and resume, most likely you will stay in your position for a very long time. Management is a mess, very toxic environment. If you're not a manager, it is VERY well known you're not. ie: ""retreats"", lots of closed door meetings, lots of management outings, and the lower level employees are not appreciated.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

Best in Class,5.0,"Jun 27, 2016","I've been with this company for a few years and watched it grow from having fewer than 50 employees in LA to a team of 250+ across a portfolio in major cities up and down the West Coast. Leadership has managed to keep priorities consistent over time -- they stress teamwork, collaboration and hard work, all while underscoring the importance of having fun together, and, of course, delivering best in class product and client service. Which, if you ask me, is about the most satisfying combination of goals for a company to tout. And they don't just talk the talk; the perqs of working at Hudson include state of the art work spaces, company outings, summer half day Fridays, stocked kitchens, catered lunches, and just about any other amenity you could want. All of it, of course, is designed to make the average employee feel as happy at work as possible, because Hudson gets it: happy employees = productive employees. I honestly can't speak to the experiences some have had regarding cliques and power, but I would not be the least bit surprised if the folks writing those reviews had some of their own issues going on. There will always be naysayers, but if you ask the average Hudson employee to give you a candid assessment of working here, I'd be surprised if you didn't get a completely positive, hopeful report. Not to mention that because there is such a premium on corporate culture and vision, recruiting is careful to select individuals who clearly embody the qualities mentioned above.

On the surface it's a pretty cool place to work.,"1) The vast majority of the most important people at Hudson either worked with the CEO at his previous company or had some other pre-existing relationship. The board is an old boys' club and so is most of the executive team. As such, the culture at the top is very insular and that has negative effects for new employees and people at the bottom. 2) Company-wide communication is pretty much non-existent; there were at least a half dozen instances in which they bought a new building or sold an existing building but never bothered to tell any of the people who weren't directly involved with the transaction. Most employees didn't find out until reading the press releases. 3) If you run into any kind of HR issue that negatively affects your work and you don't have any ""friends at the top"" then my sincere advice is this: skip the HR department and start looking for an escape route. I watched multiple people try to make formal complaints about harassment, retaliation, etc and not only was there no action taken, the HR department didn't even bother to write anything down or pretend to investigate. I'm actually being pretty diplomatic - the reality is that there are some unprofessional, toxic people working at various levels of the company and HR actively enables them through some combination of malice and incompetence. I imagine it's only a matter of time before the company gets hit with a harassment or discrimination lawsuit, if it hasn't already.","Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.",HPP,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hudson-Pacific-Properties-Reviews-E354494.htm

Pay is similar to a fast food restaurant unless you are higher up in the company (management level and up). Also, t-shirts and uniforms are absolutely terrible, especially at student the housing properties.

Given the company's poor reputation in the employment marketplace, they cannot attract the level of talent necessary to function so dysfunction continues unabated.

If you want to move up you must brown nose and show face in the office after hours and on weekends. Quantity of hours is more important than quality of work. Environment is competitive and toxic, resulting in high turnover of staff. Employees at the next level down avoid making decisions and prefer to throw their own team under the bus than to stick up for them.

It's very transparent what teams and departments are valued (i.e. asset management is a priority, accounting is not, etc.) and if you're not in one of the favored departments you won't have any room for growth. The only way to get your value recognized is to a) be a favorite of the executive over your department or b) threaten to leave. Communication between departments is abysmal. You'll be overworked and severely underpaid. Your work life balance depends on your manager; some are better than others.

Borderline Fair Housing violations were common in bad practices that allowed opportunities for some residents and not others in obscure “customer service gestures”. Over time, management implemented a cycle of requiring lower staff to enforce policies that they would then waive entirely when speaking to residents themselves, as if to deliberately make subordinate staff appear incompetent, uncaring, and mean in the eyes of residents. This created an environment in which constant negative reviews for leasing staff diminished any possibility of upward mobility no matter how strong their work ethic or sales skills.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

You will see that HR may respond to this review stating that employers are encouraged to contact when in fact we are actually shushed away by ""warnings"" so if you speak up against abuse you will be reprimanded instead. Pay is not worth it for the treatment you get here. The job itself is very overwhelming because they expect you to do your job while doing the job of others (in this case management) In my time here, I had seen two employers had breakdowns and walk out the job.

Fantastic Entry-Level Job,5.0,"Aug 25, 2020","Corporate has an awesome atmosphere, everyone is motivated, energetic, and ambitious. Great learning opportunities, and obvious room for growth/promotion since the company is rapidly growing/expanding. Coming from a company with a weak HR department, it's also refreshing to see that HR is responsive/actively reaches out to ensure that your transition is going well (for example, they have sent everyone 2 gift-baskets in the last 2 months during WFH!) Benefits/pay are also wonderful. Stock discount/401K matching is competitive, and healthcare/dental/vision is very affordable. Tuition reimbursement is also one of the highest in DC, plus the new office is unbelievable. Note to individuals considering JBG Smith: please remember that many of these reviews are from property staff, not from corporate staff. Not to discount property staff's experiences working for JBG Smith, but the corporate work experience is obviously going to be different than the property staff work experience. I almost didn't accept my position because of some of the comments posted on Glassdoor, but a few months in, I'm so glad I accepted my offer.","So far there hasn't been a lot of company social events, but of course, we're in the middle of COVID-19. Supposedly there's an annual booze cruise in October, but I'm guessing that is cancelled due to the pandemic. Either way, it could be nice if the company offered smaller virtual social events to get to know fellow co-workers/individuals in different departments since we aren't returning to the office until Spring. The only real ""con"" is that unlike other major REITS in the DC area (Avalon Bay Communities, etc.), JBG Smith does not offer an employee rent discount on company owned properties (but I can also see why so this isn't a real con and more of a wish). That said, with DC housing prices skyrocketing, I could easily see myself jumping to a REIT that offers such a program in the future if such an opportunity arose (just since rent is so expensive/huge part of any person living in DC's budget)",JBG SMITH,JBGS,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

I love working for JBG SMITH,5.0,"Apr 14, 2022","In my experience, JBG is an honest company and my morals align closely with their Core Values. I love that they are actively working to make housing affordable for those in need and they support other groups through JBG Cares. As a Residential employee, I really enjoy working with my direct supervisor and believe they would go to bat for me in just about any situation. I want to perform at a higher level because of them. JBG SMITH put a lot of thought and effort info how they operated through the pandemic. They took a conservative approach to re-opening which was difficult at times, but was ultimately for the health and wellbeing of its employees and customers. JBG paid team members that worked on site ""Hazard Pay"" in relation to COVID for about a year. All JBG employees working at the property level were eligible and we were automatically paid $3.50/hr in addition to their hourly wage. This was almost a 20% raise for many front line employees in a very uncertain time. The benefits package is very solid. JBG contributes 50% of what I contribute toward my 401k -- up to 3%. I feel that my PTO and mental health are prioritized at JBG SMITH. We now have a Cultural Reflection day each year that can be used as an additional personal day with no questions asked. JBG was on top of Juneteenth becoming a Federal Holiday and within hours of the presidential announcement, we were notified that offices would be closed the following Monday in observance of this Holiday. JBG Residential gave site team members two extra personal days to use between 1/1/22 and 2/28/22 citing that the teams working on site had been resilient through the pandemic and they wanted us to take time to mentally prepare for the upcoming season. JBG SMITH sent employees multiple care packages throughout the pandemic with food/snacks, board games, and a notes from the executive team. Matt Kelly (CEO) created weekly videos and sent them to the entire company to talk to us about new things happening at JBG to keep the entire company clued into how things were going. He often encouraged team members to stay healthy and stay home as our health was most important. Health/Dental takes care of practically wherever I want to go (including Georgetown MedStar).

"Toxic environment, poor management, & lack of advancement",1.0,"Dec 19, 2021",The new office & decent benefits (unlimited PTO & good insurance coverage),"I’m surprised by the amount of positive on this company considering the large turnover it has experience over the last couple of years, and the turnover continues even more so recently since the merger. This company loses quality employees because it lacks proper training structures within teams, an actual career path for many employees who are not in either accounting or development (as they are treated much differently than other teams), nepotism, negative/toxic work culture, and lack of work/life balance. The churn and burn from their field employees are even worse than corporate. They’re often left on their own and feel forgotten, unsupported, and less than next to corporate employees. There’s zero room for growth and this company has made it known they will keep their employee base status quo. Their retention strategies are to either offer to transfer an employee or promote them when it is too late. I see reviews that make claims about the positive direction the company is taking on diversity but it STILL severely lacks that across their executive management on down. Most of the executive leadership are there to stay and that makes it hard for others to attain upward movement unless those at the top leave. Not to mention, the executives and senior managers perpetuate the toxic culture, which was carried over from pre-merger. You’re seeing turnover in development, accounting, marketing, and HR. Very concerning to me, but not surprised. The management overseeing these groups are who cultivated and continue to perpetuate the negativity and toxicity. I don’t expect that to change unless they leave. You’ll either be pushed out or reach your breaking point here. It’s not worth it, especially for the below market pay that you’re given for the lack of work life balance. I would be cautious when reading these very vague, scripted positive reviews as it doesn’t reflect the current turn over they’re experiencing. Talk to any employee who is currently at the company and those who have left because you will hear the truth behind what goes on and this company is not headed in a positive, upward direction. Sad since this company has potential but I don’t see it succeeding.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

"Toxic work environment, lack of advancement, poor management",1.0,"Jul 2, 2021",Office space (new) & healthcare benefits,"Extremely toxic work environment where employees are overworked, under appreciated, under paid, and treated poorly by their managers (particularly if you are in accounting and HR). Very much an ‘old boys club’ or ‘frat’ culture, especially in development where employees of this department act entitled, pretentious, and have overinflated egos because of their Ivy League degrees. Other departments have a ‘bully’ culture within their teams, showing favoritism and promoting inappropriate office behavior (I.e. gossip and poor treatment towards their employees). The accounting department has very high turnover, lacking proper management and training of their new employees. HR has had a lot of turnover since the change in their management. HR executives have replaced many long standing employees with their friends or colleagues from Marriott. Hiring and recruiting practices are questionable — a lot of favoritism and nepotism occur and are mostly driven by executives and managers who hire employees as a favor. Discrimination and biased hiring decisions happen often here (I.e. hiring managers give preference to candidates with Ivy League degrees or specific brick & mortar universities versus hiring a candidate based on skills and experience). Executives hire employees in secret and make drastic changes to their staff without notice, which creates distrust amongst their employees and reflects poor recruiting practices. Their recruiting team experienced high turnover and what once was a positive team that cared about their employees, has been replaced with employees who further perpetuate the toxic work culture and don’t seem to know what they’re doing. The company has made slight improvements to their diversity and inclusion when looking at their demographics, but there’s still a lack of female and minority representation at the executive and management level. For non-corporate positions — there is an extremely high turnover rate at the property sites. The company lacks competitive pay and strong work culture that extends to their field employees. This company doesn’t provide you with any advancement or a clear career path. Onboarding and training don’t exist. You will sink or swim. One day you’re ‘in’ the next day you are ‘out’ without warning. Don’t let the fancy new office space fool you, you’re better off at a company that is employee-centric with stronger values and ethics.",JBG SMITH,JBGS,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/JBG-SMITH-Reviews-E1747097.htm

The company value their employees, making it easy to communicate and build lasting friendships within the team. Career Development: One of the standout aspects of Kilroy is its commitment to employee growth. I was encouraged to pursue professional development opportunities. I’ve had the privilege of being promoted multiple times, and each step along the way was supported by my managers, who genuinely invested in my success. Work-Life Balance: Kilroy understands that life outside of work is just as important as the work we do. I appreciate that my well-being is a priority. Innovation and Impact: Kilroy is at the forefront of innovation and sustainable practices in our industry that positively impact our communities and the environment. It’s inspiring to be part of a team that prioritizes not just profitability, but also social responsibility.","While my experience at Kilroy has been overwhelmingly positive, there are a few areas that could use improvement: Workload Fluctuations: There are times when workload can get heavy. During these times, it is hard to balance work and life; and some team members may find it tough to keep up. Communication Gaps: While the open-door policy is great, there are times when departments don't communicate well.

Negative Work Environment,2.0,"Jul 26, 2024","As a former employee who dedicated many years with the company, the SD region doesn’t shine like it used to. I’ve seen the region in its glory days when we had talented leaderships who were competent at their jobs. They were professional, reasonable, supportive, and treated everyone like family. There was growth and clear directions for the team. It was the place where everyone wants to be.","The current upper management is selective about who they want to promote. In the last several years, promotion has been based on favoritism vs performance. Employees who are dedicated and show up are often overlooked with little to no recognition. Asset managers would talk badly about their own teammates in front of others. You can hear them outside the office complaining loudly and not even trying to be discreet about it. Instead of fixing known issues, bad behaviors are often ignored and rewarded with constant praises and promotions which greatly affects office morale. Management is aware of the issues but instead of reporting it, some choose to jump on the bandwagon and disregard the problem, while others fear retaliation. High turnover of employees is a good indicator that there is a problem within the department. Often it is only talked about when the employee has left the company.",Kilroy Realty Corporation,KRC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kilroy-Realty-Reviews-E6707.htm

Their default is now to put people on PIPs to “guide them” but they really just destroy morale with no actual feedback or path. No matter your role you are micromanaged to death and expected to run everything you do (literally every thing) by your manager. The lack of autonomy is inefficient and you’re left with Senior leadership who miss deadlines, don’t sign things for weeks, constantly canceling and rescheduling meetings. They will throw you under the bus to cover for their own inadequacies the first chance they get.

Tread carefully and proceed with caution,2.0,"Dec 12, 2024","As far as corporate America goes, Kite's probably pretty standard. There is nothing particularly extraordinary about them; they're not going to win ""best place to work"" anytime soon. The benefits at Kite are where it's at. While their base pay is subpar for the tenured employees, the bonus structure, benefits plans, stock options, PTO policy, and other fringe benefits are top-notch. There is a handful of amazing employees that go above and beyond for the team and company and will make the endless job so much more manageable. The financials and the numbers are good for Kite. They're a solid company with a secure future - number wise. If they don't shape up some of the personnel issues, the numbers might start suffering.","You will be overworked while they tout work/life balance in your face. They (meaning the Leadership group) like to run as lean as possible. And yes, while this saves overhead costs, it runs employees ragged. You're given an above average amount of PTO but will struggle to find time to use it without digging yourself a nearly impossible hole upon return. Good news is that if you're a bad employee, it's almost impossible for you to get terminated from your job. The phrase ""it's better to have a butt in the seat than a cold seat"" was said a few times. It's an awful mindset and kills the morale of your good employees. The salary discrepancy between tenured employees and new employees is in the stratosphere. New employees are hired in lightyears above tenured employees and yet they wonder why tenured employees are few and far between these days. The only fairly compensated tenured employees are those at the VP or higher level. There is a boys-club and the Employee Experience (HR) team doesn't aid in curbing this perception. There is clear favoritism towards the males at the company. The bulk of the Senior Leadership team is white males; there are only 3 women in the senior leadership team. The lack of overall diversity in the leadership team also can't go unmentioned. Be careful who you tell things to at Kite; nothing is kept secret. It's a gossip mill. NOTHING is sacred at Kite. If you're lucky, you'll find a little group who you can confide in but be cautious of the bulk of people. It's a dog-eat-dog environment at Kite and people will use things you've said against you in a heartbeat if they think it will get them ahead. After the merger in October 2021, the company more than doubled in size. This was primarily handled okay, but Kite's been unsuccessful in bringing some departments around to Kite protocol. Asset Management is the biggest issue in this front - the leadership, or lack thereof, needs revamping here. They're running amuck for the most part in that department; doing their own thing on their own timelines, not following SOPs, throwing bottlenecks into processes. And with no repercussions.",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm

The environment is so toxic you can't escape it unless you leave on your own terms or get terminated. The latter is more likely to happen if you don't ""play the game."" Employee's want to trust each other, but it's hard. You don't know who's been turned and will run and tell HR every word spoken. If you read many of these reviews you'll see a pattern relating to the HR department. I won't delve into it, but can verify it's factual. There is an extremely high rate of turnover at this company, for it's size it's unheard of. While I was employed there statistics showed over a 5 year period 150 people left the company.

Management is poor at Kite. Both upper and lower management. Upper management hides behind doors and doesn't value employees. Poor management and leadership in the Asset Management team. Lack of communication. Lots of favoritism. Both VP's of this department lack leadership. Not allowed to speak to upper management as you must go through the ""chain of command"". They tell you not to speak to upper management, instead you must go to your reporting supervisor. Said supervisor will stab you in the back and run to the VP's to throw you under the bus. Yearly goals are expected to be met. Though you don't receive your goals until mid-year. This company has too many people in management that shouldn't be in their position. Their are policies to follow, yet it seems to only apply to certain people. Let's talk about the HR department. It is horrid! The VP is the most cold-hearted, unfriendly, dreadful person to ever run an HR department. I've yet to meet one person that has anything nice to say about her. She will look you up and down with distaste, it is uncomfortable. Very unapproachable. Holds grudges. Eventually most employees with end up with a target on their back. Employee turnover is extremely high at this company. In all my years in the workforce, I've never seen a company with turnover of employees as this company has. I believe more people are terminated versus leaving on their own. It's sad that upper management can't see this and doesn't question it. No room for growth at this company.

Security,1.0,"Jun 10, 2014",All the Pro's left when Gene Thompson and Dennis Scott passed. They really understood what security is and the important role that they played within the company.,"All the security staff is poorly trained, underpaid and constantly under pressure by a spineless manager. Never willing to stand up for the employees and only siding with his wife who works within the mall. Which is a company violation (fraternizing with mall tenants). The work environment was so hostile that everybody was back stabbing each other at every turn. Management treated the security staff like 3rd rate janitors. Some of the security supervisors would show up drunk or start drinking while on the job! It took one property manager 4 months to finally introduce himself to the staff. During those 4 months he just walked around and complained about every single bad detail the mall had and how the staff failed to observe it. The only growth here, is to quickly grow out of this property into a better place. Better yet, dump security and grow into a REAL CAREER and never look back. Macerich will never be the same and this mall (Pavilion) will end up like the Hawthorne Plaza. Time Off policies? Well, everyone steals from the time clock because they sign it themselves. They also steal from the lost and found via manipulating the report information. You can't count on the employees there. They will back stab you.

I write all this not to be vindictive but in the hopes that someone gets some brutally honest information from a former employee’s perspective based upon their experience and that I help offer a good person some things to consider before making a decision to work there. Also, don’t believe what you read about ability to work from home. They are not flexible in that way.

They have no professionals in HR that stand up to the bullying managers found in most parts of the company. I have heard that within HR that employee treatment is the WORST! So many at SVP and VP level continue to manage like it's 1960. The executive management team has no use for the staff level employee, they are very self-motivated and barely know employee names.

The atmosphere was very comfortable and I got along with all of my coworkers especially those I worked directly with. The pay and location were also favorable.,Upper management was incredibly inept and it felt that a lot of people in top positions got there due to past friendships or family connections.

Used to be a GREAT place to build a career,3.0,"Feb 1, 2015","The dept where I worked was full of mostly great people. There was a real team mentality and support from the C-suite down. The Westcor team always seemed to try and maintain the values and culture to keep the Macerich culture of kill or be killed at bay. If you worked in IT, the rest of the company trusted and believed in you to get things done. They really listened to the voice of the customer.","Some within the team were rsther backstabbing and/or just plain incompetent. Yet, they were kept on because they hoodwinked the manager into liking them. Some managers and up should have never gotten the position they were given. It's just that some senior personnel get too attached and won't fire them. Some of those people and managers are still there today. The Macerich culture is what has ruined the brand, overall. The flippant nature of direction, without sharing with and empowering employees to make it reality, yet holding them accountable, has driven the company into a hole. I believe Macerich will end up being taken over by the likes of Simon or GGP within the decade, as they continue to back themselves into a smaller and smaller footprint to the point of irrelevancy. HR is a complete joke. One HR senior person brags of her augmentation, yet removes good people on the flimsiest of circumstances. The rest of HR is as bad or worse.",Macerich,MAC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm
No growth opportunities,2.0,"Feb 6, 2017","Good benefits, 401k, good perks",Too many to include all. There is no room for growth. The only people that are promoted are 95% men and only if they are friends with the CEO's or executives. There are many work environment issues such as bullying and harassment. I experienced harassment at this company after 1 year working for Macerich. Nothing happens to the people that causes problems. Even if you complain. I complained of harassment to my boss and he assured me that it was reported to corporate. I was never contacted about this issue so I'm sure it was never reported.,Macerich,MAC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

"Good corporate vision, but management needs more oversight.",2.0,"Apr 25, 2016","They pay was a bit above average for the position. IT is available for any help you need. Some staff that have been there a long time balance out the whole office. The leasing staff was friendly despite having a lot going on. I liked working with guest services, they are huge asset, and keep a great relationship with the stores that management is ignoring. The maintenance staff was also great, they did their jobs and their management had a great work ethic and understanding of the property.","Working at Broadway Plaza was a negative professional experience. The environment is negative, management projects an image of perfection and kindness to the staff and the store managers, but their own agenda and expectations are the first priority. When people considered “important” would visit our site, the expectations of perfection by property management were unrealistic. If someone in the office made a mistake during one of those visits, they would be shunned. The other staff tiptoed around the upper property management in the office. I've worked at places with the CEO in the office, and they did not expect the treatment the property management of this location did. The middle managers in the office go back and forth from being great to treating the admin staff, guest services, security, housekeeping and valet management very poorly. I witnessed other employees cry, and another employee call in sick from the parking lot because she was afraid to come in. There were relations problems with the store managers that were not the big few in the mall. The management staff would spend a week planning a lunch with 2 people and ignore problems from the majority of store managers. Employees paid hourly were asked to work overtime without compensation on multiple occasions. When I and other co-workers asked to take time off to make up for unpaid overtime it was rarely given, and never offered. In addition, while working there I and other co-workers found it very difficult when we became ill. I understand the strain on co-workers and management when an employee goes through something like that, but I and other co-workers were met with zero understanding when it came to illness. I was threatened to be let go, despite not even coming close to using all allotted sick time. No, I would not recommend working here. The lack of opportunities for training and no outreach from HR about open positions makes the negative environment not worth it.",Macerich,MAC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

"A waste of my time... if I could do it over again, would not have taken the job.",1.0,"Oct 11, 2013","The co-CEOS of the firm mean well. I think they really want a company like Zappos, a company they went to visit to learn how they developed a positive work environment in a corporate world. That's about all the positive I can muster up. It was that bad.","While the co-CEOs mean well, the problems start at the top with the Partners, all the way down to the Managers, and into the HR department. The Partners play favorites, ignoring those they dislike or don't care about. They give you a fake smile and then talk behind your back. I think there was maybe 4-5 Partners throughout the firm that I met who actually were genuine, and really cared about their staff. The rest just use the staff to make themselves look good. The managers in this firm were a mix of good and bad. The bad being those who were abusive to staff. Everyone, including Partners and HR, knew about the reputations of the bad managers, but nothing was ever done. Why? Because the abusive managers brown nosed the partners, and of course, they were friends with everyone in HR. They knew the right people to befriend, so they would be untouchable. Shameful how they allowed people to be treated. The HR department is unable to keep their mouth shut, so if you have a real complaint, your best bet is to tough it out or find another job, because if you complain about them, they usually notify the offending party, and your life becomes hell then. I saw it happen to numerous people, so I knew better than to go to HR to complain about harassment. And forget about a career here. How can you have a career when the turnover rate is ridiculous, and on top of that is the massive layoffs every 2 years (they laid off nearly 7-8% of their staff (77 people) in May, while also having another 150-200 quit or get fired after the layoff (fired separately to avoid having the layoff number be higher than it already was).",Macerich,MAC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

"Top heavy, but has potential.",3.0,"Jan 19, 2009","Generally, a positive corporate culture - there are a lot of good people that work there. Excellent benefit package.","Many of the departments suffer from a top heavy organizational structure, with a staggering number of vice presidents in place shoveling out projects to the property level - most of which have little, if any, apparent relevance other than justifying the existence of their positions. Limited advancement potential for individuals in non revenue generating operational positions, as those departments tend to have a much leaner organizational structure - not to mention a constant battle to justify one's own existence through countless reports and metrics since you're not bringing in money. Often the company as a whole feels like it is managed directly out of whichever management theory book is in vogue at the moment - far too much emphasis on drilling the slogan of the moment into the collective minds of the employees versus genuinely putting into practice. Becomes Dilbert-esque after a while.",Macerich,MAC,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm
