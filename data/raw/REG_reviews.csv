Disconnect Between Rhetoric and Actions,1.0,"Aug 8, 2023","Easy hours (9:30-3:30), average benefits","No communication regarding business decisions - they forced all employees to return to a hybrid schedule without providing any substantive reason for doing so. It was commonplace have department-wide zoom meetings on work from home days, then the next day when required to be in-office I would work the entire day with my headphones on and not speak to a soul, direct manager included. It was completely counterintuitive and came off as a “power play” to force people to be in the office when they didn’t want to or need to be there. It could have also been to appease shareholders showing that they were “doing their part” to prop up spiraling commercial real estate values, but we will never know because they would never explain their intentions. Lack of diverse views by leadership - this company is huge on diversity equity and inclusion. It is very important to have diverse views, backgrounds, and viewpoints, but Regency has gone overboard and in the wrong way. They act as if diversity is only skin-deep which comes off as inherently racist, intentionally giving special resume-boosting projects, the easiest portfolios to manage, and making special exceptions of employment (special ergonomic chairs, promotions in less than 12 months, and additional unapproved time off were just three examples I personally witnessed) for employees based on what they look like and how they identify rather than how they perform. Ironically, the vast majority of the leadership team and upper-level management all grew up in Jacksonville and attended UNF for college, meaning that there is in fact little to no diversity of backgrounds, education, viewpoints, or life experiences. Weak compensation - since going public, this company heavily bends the knee to their institutional investors rather than focusing on their stated values. They say their employees are their greatest asset, but give rank-and-file employees meager 3-4% annual pay raises, while rewarding the executive team with compensation raises of 50% or more each year. When I started at Regency, my compensation was $60,000 per year, and left when it had barely cracked $64,000 two years later. In contrast, the CEO’s publicly reported compensation when I started was $3.9 million per year, and the last reported compensation when I left was well over $8 million. All the benefits are getting funneled to the top. Lack of regard for workers rights - I received retaliation for discussions regarding compensation. I was finally offered a promotion after two years (I was one of only two applicants for the job, I can’t imagine why) and discussed the promotion offer with my manager. Someone overheard the conversation, reported it to the hiring manager, then the hiring manager rescinded the promotion offer due to “public and private conversations regarding compensation” according to the confirmation email after the promotion was rescinded. Exactly one week later HR served me a notice regarding my “unprofessional conduct” and told me I was not allowed to discuss my compensation except behind closed doors. They say they do what is right, but this was absolutely unacceptable and the most unprofessional business action I have witnessed in my professional career. I would not recommend working here.
