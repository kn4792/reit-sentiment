Dysfunction at the highest levels,2.0,"Dec 14, 2018",Contemporary office space- investment in technology,Senior Management is very dysfunctional. There is a tremendous amount of back biting among the Senior leadership team that trickles down to the general population. It is almost encouraged by the CEO and CAO. While they give a half hearted attempt at a collegial and collaborative environment it couldn't be any more divisive. Morale is low and the office environment has a very heavy negative energy. Absolutely no room for growth. It's as if the CEO is intimidated by furthering the careers of very talented professionals. HR support is weak and/or non is existent.,Acadia Realty Trust,AKR,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Acadia-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E1288.htm

Horrible Place,1.0,"Mar 14, 2019",The location of their office,So many cons that it’s hard to know where to start. The current HR team couldn’t care less about their employees to even smile when they pass you in the hallway. The morale is low throughout the entire office and it feels very negative. The CEO only truly cares about the employees in the acquisitions department and leasing and the rest mean nothing. Overall the company pretends its innovative and collaborative but it’s not.
