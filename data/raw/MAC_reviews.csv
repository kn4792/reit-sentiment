Security,1.0,"Jun 10, 2014",All the Pro's left when Gene Thompson and Dennis Scott passed. They really understood what security is and the important role that they played within the company.,"All the security staff is poorly trained, underpaid and constantly under pressure by a spineless manager. Never willing to stand up for the employees and only siding with his wife who works within the mall. Which is a company violation (fraternizing with mall tenants). The work environment was so hostile that everybody was back stabbing each other at every turn. Management treated the security staff like 3rd rate janitors. Some of the security supervisors would show up drunk or start drinking while on the job! It took one property manager 4 months to finally introduce himself to the staff. During those 4 months he just walked around and complained about every single bad detail the mall had and how the staff failed to observe it. The only growth here, is to quickly grow out of this property into a better place. Better yet, dump security and grow into a REAL CAREER and never look back. Macerich will never be the same and this mall (Pavilion) will end up like the Hawthorne Plaza. Time Off policies? Well, everyone steals from the time clock because they sign it themselves. They also steal from the lost and found via manipulating the report information. You can't count on the employees there. They will back stab you. If you're not part of the ""click"", you're in for a hard time. There too many negatives to list, so just stay away from this area and the company all together!",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

Amazing group of people who take pride in their work.,4.0,"Apr 26, 2015","I love the mall office environment. I've worked at several different locations and loved my coworkers at each one. Lots of autonomy to do what the team believes is best. Very exciting work environment, never live the same day twice. In the past, the company was willing to make significant investments in employee growth.","Too much time spent talking about what we're going to do and not enough time spent actually executing plans. A lot of meetings, conference calls and reporting that don't generate results. Too many cooks in the kitchen with conflicting opinions leaving field level employees with lack of clear direction. Constant demand to do more with less compromises our standards.

When I suggested it takes 3 hours of my day to drive only let me work from home and I will ho above and beyond in my work but they rejected and said it's their policy and no changes to it . And after that they have audacity to say they are very family friendly and flexible company and also they are worried that in new trend people may quite quit .. we'll what so u expect ? 12 hours of driving and woking ?

Not a great place to work used to be better,2.0,"Mar 13, 2018",The only real reason to work here is to gain experience and build your resume and then take it with you somewhere better.,"Many, many cons. Based upon my experience, hostile working environment, not-so-great pay (not even really market competitive), micromanagement hell, heavy workload, few growth opportunities, upper management absolutely does not care about employees, high turnover. Typically there are layoffs every year in February like clockwork. I write all this not to be vindictive but in the hopes that someone gets some brutally honest information from a former employee’s perspective based upon their experience and that I help offer a good person some things to consider before making a decision to work there. Also, don’t believe what you read about ability to work from home. They are not flexible in that way. Raises and bonuses (if you get either) are done with extreme scrutiny and penny pinching even for the better employees. If you want to work for a typical not so great corporate America type environment, then this place is the epitome.",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm
HR is incompetent and corrupt.,1.0,"May 25, 2014","There are very few departments at Macerich that have high retention. Those that do have happier employees, and completely ignore HR practices and programs - which are completely outdated. If you are lucky enough to be in one of those departments you will get at or above average raises and bonuses, regular promotions, and will likely be instructed to stay away from HR.","The HR department has absolutely no credibility or influence in the organization. They have no professionals in HR that stand up to the bullying managers found in most parts of the company. I have heard that within HR that employee treatment is the WORST! So many at SVP and VP level continue to manage like it's 1960. The executive management team has no use for the staff level employee, they are very self-motivated and barely know employee names. The company touts being adaptable and ready for change, but that is totally untrue.

"Great Company, Terrible Managers",2.0,"Apr 25, 2015","Wonderful values, nice office, great co workers, great mission statement. Holiday parties are nice.","Supporting 3+ people at a time is too overwhelming, felt more like a personal assistant at times than an admin. There are too many egos and personalities to handle for one person. I think some of the people don't realize that this isn't vogue or glamour magazine they're working for, it's property management. One mistake, and they're quick to write you off and make you feel like garbage. Micro managing doesn't exist and if you ask a question, you get lectured. Upper management should have their own Personal/Admin assistant. They act like they're way too above to do certain things for themselves.

Not Valued,2.0,"Mar 31, 2022","First job out of college as a computer science major. I guess they took a chance on me, even though I had IT experience in college. Pay was a bit higher than average for a help desk role. Not a bad starter position, but definitely not a long-term place you want to be.","I was a model employee for two years and was fired for throwing a beach ball over the cubicle divider (that hit an HR worker). OH NO! Did you get hit by an inflatable beach ball? I had already given my two weeks notice, so it didn't affect me much - but if you are a 5 star employee for years and they let you go at the drop of a hat, you can tell they don't care much for the lower levels of staff.

Reasonable with work-life balance requirements.,"Who you know is much more important than what you know. Outward appearances are more important than actual results. Career advancement is very slow. Type A personalities (extroverts) rewarded, while Type B personalities (introverts) are ignored. A large portion of the company is middle management, all given ""Vice President"" titles.

"Limited upside, mediocre raises, favoritism",2.0,"Oct 6, 2022",There are some great people to work with at the company,"There is a large chasm between groups who work here. Seemingly divided into those at the company less than 5 years, and those greater than 10 years. For those who haven't been around awhile, there is a steep climb for newer employees to be promoted and achieve meaningful pay raises. Alot of quality management personnel left the firm over the past 7 years, which left those remaining 'veterans' victorious in the war of attrition. Not all of them are the most capable... but they certainly have seniority. Work/life balance is a bit of a joke. Its preached but never provided. Expect to work late and/or on the weekends.

Right by the Water,4.0,"Jul 16, 2015",I enjoyed my time at Macerich due to the managable workload and laid back managerial approach by my superior. The atmosphere was very comfortable and I got along with all of my coworkers especially those I worked directly with. The pay and location were also favorable.,Upper management was incredibly inept and it felt that a lot of people in top positions got there due to past friendships or family connections.

There's one in every office and seemed to be more at Macerich.,Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm
Used to be a GREAT place to build a career,3.0,"Feb 1, 2015","The dept where I worked was full of mostly great people. There was a real team mentality and support from the C-suite down. The Westcor team always seemed to try and maintain the values and culture to keep the Macerich culture of kill or be killed at bay. If you worked in IT, the rest of the company trusted and believed in you to get things done. They really listened to the voice of the customer.","Some within the team were rsther backstabbing and/or just plain incompetent. Yet, they were kept on because they hoodwinked the manager into liking them. Some managers and up should have never gotten the position they were given. It's just that some senior personnel get too attached and won't fire them. Some of those people and managers are still there today. The Macerich culture is what has ruined the brand, overall. The flippant nature of direction, without sharing with and empowering employees to make it reality, yet holding them accountable, has driven the company into a hole. I believe Macerich will end up being taken over by the likes of Simon or GGP within the decade, as they continue to back themselves into a smaller and smaller footprint to the point of irrelevancy. HR is a complete joke. One HR senior person brags of her augmentation, yet removes good people on the flimsiest of circumstances.

I experienced harassment at this company after 1 year working for Macerich. Nothing happens to the people that causes problems. Even if you complain.

"Good corporate vision, but management needs more oversight.",2.0,"Apr 25, 2016","They pay was a bit above average for the position. IT is available for any help you need. Some staff that have been there a long time balance out the whole office. The leasing staff was friendly despite having a lot going on. I liked working with guest services, they are huge asset, and keep a great relationship with the stores that management is ignoring. The maintenance staff was also great, they did their jobs and their management had a great work ethic and understanding of the property.","Working at Broadway Plaza was a negative professional experience. The environment is negative, management projects an image of perfection and kindness to the staff and the store managers, but their own agenda and expectations are the first priority. When people considered “important” would visit our site, the expectations of perfection by property management were unrealistic. If someone in the office made a mistake during one of those visits, they would be shunned. The other staff tiptoed around the upper property management in the office. I've worked at places with the CEO in the office, and they did not expect the treatment the property management of this location did. The middle managers in the office go back and forth from being great to treating the admin staff, guest services, security, housekeeping and valet management very poorly. I witnessed other employees cry, and another employee call in sick from the parking lot because she was afraid to come in. There were relations problems with the store managers that were not the big few in the mall. The management staff would spend a week planning a lunch with 2 people and ignore problems from the majority of store managers. Employees paid hourly were asked to work overtime without compensation on multiple occasions. When I and other co-workers asked to take time off to make up for unpaid overtime it was rarely given, and never offered. In addition, while working there I and other co-workers found it very difficult when we became ill. I understand the strain on co-workers and management when an employee goes through something like that, but I and other co-workers were met with zero understanding when it came to illness. I was threatened to be let go, despite not even coming close to using all allotted sick time. No, I would not recommend working here. The lack of opportunities for training and no outreach from HR about open positions makes the negative environment not worth it.",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm

"A waste of my time... if I could do it over again, would not have taken the job.",1.0,"Oct 11, 2013","The co-CEOS of the firm mean well. I think they really want a company like Zappos, a company they went to visit to learn how they developed a positive work environment in a corporate world. That's about all the positive I can muster up. It was that bad.","While the co-CEOs mean well, the problems start at the top with the Partners, all the way down to the Managers, and into the HR department. The Partners play favorites, ignoring those they dislike or don't care about. They give you a fake smile and then talk behind your back. I think there was maybe 4-5 Partners throughout the firm that I met who actually were genuine, and really cared about their staff. The rest just use the staff to make themselves look good. The managers in this firm were a mix of good and bad. The bad being those who were abusive to staff. Everyone, including Partners and HR, knew about the reputations of the bad managers, but nothing was ever done. Why? Because the abusive managers brown nosed the partners, and of course, they were friends with everyone in HR. They knew the right people to befriend, so they would be untouchable. Shameful how they allowed people to be treated. The HR department is unable to keep their mouth shut, so if you have a real complaint, your best bet is to tough it out or find another job, because if you complain about them, they usually notify the offending party, and your life becomes hell then. I saw it happen to numerous people, so I knew better than to go to HR to complain about harassment. And forget about a career here. How can you have a career when the turnover rate is ridiculous, and on top of that is the massive layoffs every 2 years (they laid off nearly 7-8% of their staff (77 people) in May, while also having another 150-200 quit or get fired after the layoff (fired separately to avoid having the layoff number be higher than it already was).",Macerich,MAC,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Macerich-Reviews-E3939.htm
