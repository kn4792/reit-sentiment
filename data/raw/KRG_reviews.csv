Company with Growth Mindset,5.0,"Apr 2, 2025",Great co-workers in a fun industry.,"No work-life balance, and emphasis on working in person at the office.",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm

Fast Paced and Engaging Environment,5.0,"Jan 27, 2025",Very much a meritocracy that recognizes performance and encourages employees to contribute in areas that are not necessarily within the job description. Collegial environment especially in Indy,"Would like more opportunities to interact with field employees. Also, lots of online resources for training and career development, just wish there were more in-person opportunities with leaders outside of HR.",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm
Tread carefully and proceed with caution,2.0,"Dec 12, 2024","As far as corporate America goes, Kite's probably pretty standard. There is nothing particularly extraordinary about them; they're not going to win ""best place to work"" anytime soon. The benefits at Kite are where it's at. While their base pay is subpar for the tenured employees, the bonus structure, benefits plans, stock options, PTO policy, and other fringe benefits are top-notch. There is a handful of amazing employees that go above and beyond for the team and company and will make the endless job so much more manageable. The financials and the numbers are good for Kite. They're a solid company with a secure future - number wise. If they don't shape up some of the personnel issues, the numbers might start suffering.","You will be overworked while they tout work/life balance in your face. They (meaning the Leadership group) like to run as lean as possible. And yes, while this saves overhead costs, it runs employees ragged. You're given an above average amount of PTO but will struggle to find time to use it without digging yourself a nearly impossible hole upon return. Good news is that if you're a bad employee, it's almost impossible for you to get terminated from your job. The phrase ""it's better to have a butt in the seat than a cold seat"" was said a few times. It's an awful mindset and kills the morale of your good employees. The salary discrepancy between tenured employees and new employees is in the stratosphere. New employees are hired in lightyears above tenured employees and yet they wonder why tenured employees are few and far between these days. The only fairly compensated tenured employees are those at the VP or higher level. There is a boys-club and the Employee Experience (HR) team doesn't aid in curbing this perception. There is clear favoritism towards the males at the company. The bulk of the Senior Leadership team is white males; there are only 3 women in the senior leadership team. The lack of overall diversity in the leadership team also can't go unmentioned. Be careful who you tell things to at Kite; nothing is kept secret. It's a gossip mill. NOTHING is sacred at Kite. If you're lucky, you'll find a little group who you can confide in but be cautious of the bulk of people. It's a dog-eat-dog environment at Kite and people will use things you've said against you in a heartbeat if they think it will get them ahead. After the merger in October 2021, the company more than doubled in size. This was primarily handled okay, but Kite's been unsuccessful in bringing some departments around to Kite protocol. Asset Management is the biggest issue in this front - the leadership, or lack thereof, needs revamping here. They're running amuck for the most part in that department; doing their own thing on their own timelines, not following SOPs, throwing bottlenecks into processes. And with no repercussions.",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm

Toxic environment,2.0,"Apr 9, 2021",The majority of the people that actually do the work are great.,"The best way to describe the culture is Miscavige - lite! The environment is so toxic you can't escape it unless you leave on your own terms or get terminated. The latter is more likely to happen if you don't ""play the game."" Employee's want to trust each other, but it's hard. You don't know who's been turned and will run and tell HR every word spoken. If you read many of these reviews you'll see a pattern relating to the HR department. I won't delve into it, but can verify it's factual. There is an extremely high rate of turnover at this company, for it's size it's unheard of. While I was employed there statistics showed over a 5 year period 150 people left the company. The company is roughly 150 people. Very rarely are women promoted to management positions.

Terrible Management,2.0,"Aug 4, 2020","location, paid parking, nice offices","HR is the opposite of what an HR should be.

Horrible Management,1.0,"Oct 30, 2020","Dress code is great, jeans every day. PTO is generous.","In all my years of work experience, this was the worst company I've ever worked for. Management is poor at Kite. Both upper and lower management. Upper management hides behind doors and doesn't value employees. Poor management and leadership in the Asset Management team. Lack of communication. Lots of favoritism. Both VP's of this department lack leadership. Not allowed to speak to upper management as you must go through the ""chain of command"". They tell you not to speak to upper management, instead you must go to your reporting supervisor. Said supervisor will stab you in the back and run to the VP's to throw you under the bus. Yearly goals are expected to be met. Though you don't receive your goals until mid-year. This company has too many people in management that shouldn't be in their position. Their are policies to follow, yet it seems to only apply to certain people. Let's talk about the HR department. It is horrid! The VP is the most cold-hearted, unfriendly, dreadful person to ever run an HR department. I've yet to meet one person that has anything nice to say about her. She will look you up and down with distaste, it is uncomfortable. Very unapproachable. Holds grudges. Eventually most employees with end up with a target on their back. Employee turnover is extremely high at this company. In all my years in the workforce, I've never seen a company with turnover of employees as this company has. I believe more people are terminated versus leaving on their own. It's sad that upper management can't see this and doesn't question it. No room for growth at this company. If you are offered a job here, I suggest you to run!",Kite Realty Group Trust,KRG,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Kite-Realty-Reviews-E35119.htm
