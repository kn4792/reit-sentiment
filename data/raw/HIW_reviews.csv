This Company is Not What it Used to Be,3.0,"Aug 5, 2024","Although there are some great people working here, others not so much and these are in the leadership/c-suite area. Overall benefit package is good with matching 401-K; $.75 per dollar on your first 6% invested. FSA on heath/child care/elder care. HSA and traditional health, dental, and vision programs. ESPP at discount, LTD and STD. Catastrophic health plans as well. The elephant in the room is that salary lags behind, especially if you've been there for some time. New hires will come in at higher salary amounts. Field personnel will receive an iPhone that can be used personally, and some receive laptops. Three weeks of vacation plus two personal holidays in addition to traditional holidays. Sick time is liberal right now.","Several years ago there was a fantastic CEO who was a servant leader. He knew everyone in the company, and worked his way up from just cutting the grass. Unfortunately now there is a different CEO who is more ego-centric. He has never held a position in operations having come out of the financial sector. The others in the c-suite are a mixed lot with some attempting to communicate with those outside of the c-suite while others are focused on their own country club life. This company has fully embraced DEI and ESG to the point of ignoring just why they are even in business. Navigating around this is like picking your way through a minefield! Too many of the great, seasoned employees have left due to the low pay, c-suite attitude, DEI and ESG b.s. and poor leadership in some of the divisions. One division had approximately 10 vacancies at the same time. Of course this affects the morale of others as they are forced to pick up the slack. The hiring process can be lengthy. Advancement can be non-existent depending on what position you hold.","Highwoods Properties, Inc.",HIW,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Highwoods-Properties-Reviews-E2674.htm

Total Circus,2.0,"Apr 10, 2019","Worked with many great individuals, made life-long friends and connections.","While I'm confident that many people have had and will continue to have a great experience at Highwoods, I did not. This was mostly due to intradepartmental chaos. In my particular situation, my leader seemed unequipped for the position and unable to properly lead our team - resulting in poorly managed projects, lack of time management and disregard for employees' time/work/needs. Perhaps not with intention, but through his/her actions, the head of our department showed more interest in pleasing his/her superior than trusting the expertise of his/her team. This, in conjunction with the arbitrary system of promotions/probation/lack of promotions within our department, often left me scratching my head.","Highwoods Properties, Inc.",HIW,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Highwoods-Properties-Reviews-E2674.htm
