New CEO is Donnelly not Brugger.",- prior leadership (Brugger) was terrible - they got fired in April 2024.

3 Year Analyst Program - Great foundation,5.0,"Apr 15, 2016",I went through DRH's 3 year analyst program after graduating from undergrad. It was a great place to start my career and build a foundation of knowledge in the hospitality / real estate industry. Upper management took an active interest in my development and got me involved in multiple facets of the company. Loved the team environment. Exit opportunities were solid and the C-level execs were very helpful with advice and recommendations when my analyst program was coming to an end.,Nothing major comes to mind. They let me travel a solid amount but would've loved to travel even more.,DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
Diamond Rocks!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2016","DiamondRock is a real estate company focused on the hospitality industry. The basic function of the company, to own hotels, is an exciting premise. I mean, who wouldn’t want an occupation that is the real-life equivalent of the Monopoly Man? The hotel business is an industry that is rooted in taking care of hotels that, in turn, take care of employees and travelers. It is an industry that has a meaningful impact on the daily lives of many people. The company is very well organized and operations run smoothly. The team is talented and motivated, with employees working hard to continue to help grow the company. DiamondRock is also a responsible corporate citizen and a great member of the Bethesda community by offering opportunities for employees to participate in local community service initiatives (also, read on to discover my notes about Bethesda later). The executives of the company are very approachable. The company prides itself on good communication, and it is easy to speak with the company’s key leaders. The executives make it a priority to ensure that all employees are aware of major directives, projects and goals. Also, the executives have an open door policy for questions, which is pretty cool. Now on to the important stuff. There is a snack room with unlimited, bottomless, snacks and soda (at least three types of pretzels at all times)! If you want to set a new personal best for afternoon soda consumption, there will be nothing stopping you. There’s even a really high-tech coffee machine that I’m convinced you can only operate if your previous employer was NASA. Also, there are a variety of entertaining informal and formal social events that help employees get to know each other in a more informal setting. And now to address a slightly controversial topic, the office’s location in Bethesda. Since the good folks at Glassdoor.com do not have a category for items that have both positive and negative attributes (NOTE TO GLASSDOOR: create a category for things that are boths pro's and con's), I’m placing this squarely into the positive attribute category. Pro because there are many hospitality industry companies in Bethesda, which creates a lot of networking opportunities. Pro because DiamondRock’s office occupies the best location in Bethesda, right on top of the Bethesda Metro Station (Red Line), and within three blocks of about 100 shops and restaurants (note, this is an approximate count and probably cannot be relied upon as an official statistic). Con because you are not in city-center Washington, DC. Bethesda is a small city where the majority of the workforce departs the area after the workday has concluded. However, Bethesda does have its perks if you need to finish up some last minute holiday shopping, replace an I-phone that you recently dropped while swimming in a lake, or find a tailor to mend your suit because your best friend decided to elope and only provided you with three days’ notice (it happened).","Although DiamondRock is a mid-cap public company traded on the NYSE, the workforce does not consist of that many people. Choosing to work at a small versus a large company is a lot like choosing to attend a liberal arts college or venture to State U. At a small college, everybody knows your name while at a large school you have the benefit of complete anonymity until a professor finally inquires where you have been all semester. Just note that at DiamondRock you won’t find an internal intranet with postings for 500 open positions, but you also won’t be required to attend a two-month training program at some spooky Upstate New York corporate campus.",DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
Three Year Analyst Program,5.0,"May 3, 2016",Amazing leadership and professional development in the three year analyst program! The group embraced a strong sense of teamwork while producing meaningful material for the company. The program developed a broad set of skills and set a firm foundation in hotel real estate while the role had exposure to C-Level management and all departments within the company. The company and analyst team culture created an fun and comfortable workplace while the work was dynamic and challenging.,"None really. Since it's a small company there aren't very many mid-management roles, but senior management was still invested in career development.",DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
Great Place to Work,5.0,"Dec 10, 2015","DiamondRock is a great place to work. Everyone is very friendly, there is a great corporate culture that is casual, yet professional.",Its a small company so there is little room for internal professional growth.,DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm
