"Challenging role with opportunities, but major leadership issues",2.0,"Mar 4, 2025",-Some supportive colleagues who genuinely cared for residents. -Fast paced environment and learned a lot quickly. -Given freedom or empowerment to resolve issues without upper management approval. -Fun yearly trip to Disneyland or Universal. Benefits: $30/hourly is decent,"-Unrealistic, heavy workload with little to no recognition for contributions leading to heavy turnover in LA region. -Unhealthy relationships between office and maintenance. Maintenance is treated with more respect overall. -Frequent favoritism and inconsistent management practices. -Employees FREQUENTLY bear the consequences for upper managements mistakes. -Often felt unsafe at properties and had numerous instances of residents threatening or charging at staff. Begged for security cameras where staff was working alone onsite and this was not a financial priority for them. -Starting pay as a supervisor was lower than an RCC hourly at the time of hire. Had to go to management for 7 months to get this mistake corrected. -Multiple fair housing violations made by management in order to keep residents quiet about issues. -Gossip talk across properties causing a hostile work environment.

Pushed out by toxic management and favoritism,2.0,"Jul 28, 2025","-Great benefits -Training provided -No prior experience needed -Fun company outings -You will meet great people that work within your neighborhood -The problem is not the company itself, but the people they hire","Where do I begin? Low pay, low housing discount, low bonus structure and pay per lease, split days off that lead to extreme burnout, zero work life balance, having to come in on your day off for some ridiculous meeting, overworked, understaffed, aggressive and very needy residents, I could go on and barely scratch the tip of the iceberg. However, the real problem lies within management. I felt like my management did not care about me, nor did they care about my growth and development, or my goals and aspirations. I rarely, if ever, received feedback from my supervisor as I was supposed to, yet, my coworker(s) would get weekly feedback in the form of one on one meetings because the supervisor was their best friend. I wasn't even aware of how poor I was doing until it came in the form of a verbal warning. Favoritism ran rampant at the property I was at and I truly felt like I did not matter, nor did anything I did for the company as I was barely spoken to most days, ostracized on a daily basis, constantly left alone in the office whilst my manager would socialize with the favorites in their office day after day. When they did speak to me, they often spoke down to me like I was an ignorant child and a nuisance. I did not feel welcome at all and began to dread the job so much I was having daily panic attacks before work and had to be put on anxiety medication to cope. This company can truly be great, but if you are unfortunate enough to get a bad management team who does not care about you, you will not be able to see the full potential. On my last day, they revoked my access to the building before I even got there so I guess they were eager to get me out--super unprofessional all around.

Company is selling everyone out for AI,1.0,"Mar 14, 2025",- Great hard working under appreciated staff.,- Making you work multiple properties doing the work of 2-4 people with NO additional pay. - AI and remote leasing taking away opportunities for growth and replacing jobs. The company is encouraging this fully and very quickly. - Lack of care. They ask us about change and then do nothing to really make our lives better. Same thing higher ups do daily to residents. - Bonus structure is the worst I’ve ever seen. Low commission plus It’s purposely confusing to the point no one can really explain it to you outside of HR. - Forced to sell inflated sometimes bad product cause the company won’t invest quick enough to make the building better/safer. - No work life balance as your hour lunch break is not included in your 8 hour shift. So your 9-5 is a 9-6. Really a 7-7 including this is how much of the day you have to give to getting ready and coming home. - CEO only speaks in numbers. - Overall very under appreciated work.,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

There's often pressure to perform consistently, which can be stressful if traffic is slow or the market is tough.

Would avoid,3.0,"Mar 15, 2025",-Benefits are quite good and to some that might be worth the low pay - decent training opportunity if looking to move elsewhere soon,"Set up like a 9-5 sweatshop. Performance standards are data driven but people cheat to achieve a bonus. Can’t blame them because wage is not in alignment with cost of living and it is barely in alignment if a bonus is achieved. Standards are skewed based on cheating behavior and the cycle keeps going if team matches or exceeds because standards will be raised to prevent paying out bonuses. The prefer quick canned answer work style, and good customer service is not really the goal. Habitually understaffed, bonuses can be available but you must chuck ethics out the door to qualify.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

The property manager changed three times while I was there and the last one blatantly disregarded multiple issues regarding racism with one key employee as well as not looking into policy when they were asked if I could wear a head wrap but they told me that it was not something that I could wear at work which is illegal but also they didn't even take the time to look it up they told me they would get back to me in 2 weeks and then did not get back to me so after 3 weeks I went over to ask them if this was something I could do which two weeks seems like way more than the time needed to find this out they seem to frazzled that I came back to ask as I had stated a head wrap makes me feel more conservative and comfortable they quickly told me that it was not something that we could do,"AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Things are changing,3.0,"Aug 1, 2024",I like my job but it’s tough out here.,"Change to hybrid work policy after 4 years remote. Lay people off to save money and then overload people that are left behind. CEO and BOD have false claims for their reasonings for company change. Like collaboration or building culture. Makes no sense when team members are across the country and sites are in different regions. It’s just an excuse. Culture is going down because everyone is scared they’re going to lose their job and are forced to come back to the office. No increase in pay to return, we should get compensated for that. Work life balance is off if I get emails at 10pm at night from people and that is a theme with this company. I don’t care for the new CEO and BOD, the changes in the company are a result of their decisions and it’s made life harder because of them.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Develop a deeper understanding of the roles and responsibilities of onsite teams, particularly in relation to the unique social and political climates of the communities they serve. Sales Leaders and Directors should are not attuned to the challenges faced by associates on a daily basis. Reevaluate the methodology for determining rental charges and renewal increases for associates living on site. Recognize the significant discrepancy between rent hikes, which can be as high as 10%, and pay raises, which often fall short at just a few cents on the dollar or a mere 3%. This discrepancy has lead to feelings of underappreciation among onsite associates and one of many reasons that I do not find myself at AvalonBay in the next 12 months.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

"""We're a Family!"" Not.",2.0,"Feb 11, 2024",Fully remote role Acknowledgement and celebration of postive feedback from clients,"I was initially excited to work for AVB as their communities have great reviews from residents in my area. I felt my high-level of work would be a great fit as I receive consistent positive feedback from clients. This became the case as well in my role with AVB, in which I graduated at the top of my class and received the highest amount of positive reviews from clients. All that said, there were red flags from the start that influenced my decision to quit. At the time of my hiring, important technical requirements and responsibilities of the role were not disclosed to me, which resulted in undue stress and confusion. Instead of AVB admitting they had not been clear in their communication they attempted to gaslight me which did not work as everything was documented. I made repeated requests for a basic work accommodation which was not approved until the day I decided to quit. I was reprimanded about attendance despite informing my manager I have regular doctors' visits that I must attend for ongoing treatment. I was never late, and never took off work for funsies. This didn't seem to matter to my supervisor. I observed a lack of integrity, which left me with a diminished sense of trust in the company and its leadership. AVB was very quick to use the ""We're a family' schpiel, but they fired a single mother breast-cancer survivor because her child-care fell through in the middle of training. I don't know of any ""family"" that would do that. Management also mentioned several times that no one has anything negative to say about AVB, which is untrue. A simple search of Glass Door reviews proves otherwise. It always irked me when they would tell this flat out lie. What others have spoken on about the docking of points is true. You can do everything right and one little thing they deem as being missed means you lose all the points. This includes losing points for things you were not trained on. I asked directly if this would be the case and was told yes. The trainers constantly swear points don’t matter and lead you into a false sense of security. Every point matters.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Cutting staff continuously from communities, not replacing staff when they leave. There’s no work life balance unless you compare it to that of retail or fast food. You can hardly take the vacation time you accrue because there’s no coverage. Upper Management has no idea of what it’s like to be on the front line, and the daily items at these communities and things we have to figure out because they won’t fix things. Even though the CEO does “visits” they spend time covering up and fixing things that should have already been done and we aren’t allowed to say how we actually feel or discuss real problems but instead are given parameters for what we can speak about. The company culture is dated, no real growth outside RS, and the resource groups are mouthpieces with no actual action being taken. It’s just not what it used to be. People use to matter but it’s all about the numbers now.

Constantly looking to cut back on employees and allow the on-site teams to suffer. The company no longer aligns with core values that were once truthful. A business is a business, but AvalonBay has done nothing but focus on investors and cutting costs while their crucial employees are drowning. Employees feel worthless. Top talent giving notice week by week and it couldn't be more of a sign that the company has become just terrible to work for. With the amount of work and extra time and energy that the on-site teams are having to deal with due to these changes, some genuine appreciation should be shown.

"High expectations, over worked, little support",1.0,"Sep 10, 2023",Many opportunities to work in various locations through out the country. The team I work with (not managers).,"You have to manage four plus communities and they market it as working in a ""neighborhood"" but in reality it's a terrible way to over work you and make you work various communities all in one day. The expectations are incredibly high, there is no active phone line for any one to reach you, residents are not allowed in the office (not even for emergencies) and you are instructed to ask them to submit all requests through an app. The expectations are to provide amazing customer service but you don't even know the customers, it’s hard to build relationships as a Supervisor when you are thrown nothing but escalating issues your way, if a move in goes wrong you’re expected to fix it. If a work order takes too long to be taken care of, you get the angry resident, if there’s a neighbor dispute you have to resolve it… etc. Everything is done over a chat or a phone call that you place at your convenience which might not align with your residents schedule. You are then expected to host multiple resident events with a very small budget. The tools to be successful are terrible. Managing communities through an app and expecting positive feedback 100 percent of the time is wild. Also be prepared for a crash course training, there is zero fellow camaraderie with other teams so don’t bother reaching out to coworkers in the area for help (which probably don’t have much time to help anyways since they’re dealing with the same work load). Your work schedule is inconsistent (work hours vary). You might have to settle for a Monday/Tuesday off schedule while the Community Consultants have a Sunday/Monday off schedule. Zero work life balance, vacation time is a pain to get approved and if the office(s) you over see do not have coverage they adjust other Supervisors schedules (causing friction between Supervisors). Commissions are very low for the LA market and bonuses are literally non existent, when you’re offered the job they factor in your bonus potential into your compensation yet the bonus is not a guaranteed amount and your rent discount is a joke at 20 percent off when rent prices are sky high and other companies offer discounts at 40 to 50 percent off to all employees.

Great Company to further your career,4.0,"Mar 3, 2023","Pro 1- Ability to work with ease under management. Management is awesome, company wide, not just in one particular area or city. Its quite impressive the quality of people they hire within this company that appears consistent across the board(of course there will always be exceptions). No micro managing. Experienced, kind, knowledgeable, and relaxed management. Pro 2- Ability to further your career. They don't just say that, they are encouraging and will assist you with advancing your career goals within their company as there are many options to grow and diversify. That pertains to rookies and experienced industries leaders alike at this company. If you want to grow, you can and will here. Pro 3- EXCELLENT 'work --life balance' here. This makes ALL the difference, as us hard-working and diligent American's know- we are worked to the bone and having an occupation with a healthy work /life balance is near impossible to find these days, especially in starting with a new company. That is a non-issue at Avalonbay and in my opinion/experience ---can even outweigh salary in some situations because of the substantial value that holds in our busy lives. They do not deny you of that, are very open to time off, vacations, etc and a schedule that fits your needs. You will never feel overtaken by work in your personal life, I appreciated that immensely.","Con 1- In leasing, you will have a 'down' season, of course, as well as an 'up' season meaning you will make more money during particular points in the year and less at other times, it will not always be consistent. There are huge advantages to leasing online during the down times as well as multiple marketing options to keeps your sales rolling in, however it is something to consider. Con 2- Weekends are best times to lease, that's when people are shopping for homes/apartments, so sacrificing some time on the weekends would be in your best interest if you want take advantage of those primo days to sell. Con 3- Unfortunately they are one of the many companies that have not got the memo--""your relentless and ongoing meetings are not neccessary and take away from productivity."" I think we all have these complaints regarding the endless amount of meetings we attend in the work force and typically day dream through, while panicking at the same time having your work sit on your desk unattended. This you will still find to be the case, even having to travel occasionally to do so. However, you are compensated for travel accordingly, and when I say accordingly, I mean as employees should be compensated(not just the bare minimum), which is rare and appreciated. You are paid for gas, travel time, usually receive a meal and the remainder of the day off but paid, pretty nice! It also assists in getting to know your affiliates company wide. Con 4- Had an issue with payroll that took too long to correct, however when it was brought to the right persons attention it was addressed immediately. At the time, it was somewhat discouraging as a newbie, however, I could've been more assertive in resolving it faster. but was hesitant to be the squeaky wheel when I was new.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Working hard will only get you more work with no pay increase. All they can usually offer you is work experience without a title or salary which may work for some people depending on your situation. Work evaluation is subjective and with multiple people with differences in knowledge of policies and procedures, it can be frustrating getting the right information at times . Your work will be considered wrong or right depending on who reviews your work and how much they know which was an issue for me. Unless you share expenses with someone it will be hard to support yourself with this full time position alone. You can transfer departments with a raise that is non negotiable (like all raises) and everyone is given the same rate and it is very low. Working from home as shown me this company doesn't really care about it's employees and sees their top performers as replaceable. Even managers don't make a lot.

Company events are always a blast and all the employees seem to share the same enthusiasm for the success of the company. It's exciting to be part of something so focused on making new advances towards bettering themselves, not only for the company's success, but for the employees, residents, and community benefit, as well.

Don’t stay as long as me,2.0,"May 15, 2021",There is a career path to follow to no matter which side of the business you enter.,"The industry is heading towards self service and automation. During my 12 years with the company, I was continually asked to do more with less. The company’s stated culture is fantastic, but your actual experience will depend on the leadership within your region. My most recent experience was in a region that lacked any real leadership. There was no personal touch or caring from the top. They only cared about their jobs. I spent 12 years with the company and applied for a position within another department. I was never offered an interview. I emailed the hiring manager directly and found out they were close to hiring someone. I withdrew my application when I heard from the hiring manger. AVB recruitment reached out to me to let me know they were surprised I withdrew my application, because I was a serious applicant. They were more interested in covering their liability then just being honest with me, after 12 years of loyalty. My lesson learned from this experience - loyalty is truly no longer valued by organizations. Avalon is no exception to this. I worked through COVID on-site everyday through 2020. I worked through staff shortages and the generous EPL offerings to our associates. I received no thanks for these things efforts. I was given a 2% merit increase and told I should be thankful to have a job. I left after 12 years because of ineffective leadership within my specific region - Denver.

It sounds corny, but I really do look forward to going to work! One great thing about my office is all the free food! We have a wide variety of delicious snacks, and we get free lunch quite often. We celebrate birthdays every month. The birthday folks get to choose which desserts we get, so there is a wide variety of delicious treats. Our summer picnic and our holiday party are actually fun — not like at some other companies I've worked for, where spending time with co-workers feels like a chore. I love the philanthropic side of AvalonBay, too. We have lots of volunteer opportunities, and employees get paid for time that they spend volunteering at company-organized events. We do something for Earth Day every year, and we have a couple of item drives per year. In terms of growth opportunities, AvalonBay is unmatched. Managers are attentive, and if you want to advance your career, even if you want to explore opportunities in a different department, your manager will help you get there. Before coming to AvalonBay, I had worked at five different companies over the course of seven years. At AvalonBay, I finally feel like I'm home.","Because we are a large company with offices throughout the country, sometimes doing seemingly basic things, like paying an invoice, can involve many steps, many people, and take longer than necessary.

Flexibility helps create a work-life balance,5.0,"Aug 12, 2015",This is a company that truly cares about their Associates and I would recommend AvalonBay to everyone. You cannot truly appreciate how well AvalonBay treats their Associates unless you have been at company that treats their employees like a disposable commodity and works them to death. AvalonBay is aware of work-life balance issues and they try to work with Associates whenever possible. I have seen schedules shifted so one Associate can make all their kid’s soccer games on Mondays in the spring. They intern help cover for other Associates other times during the year. AvalonBay has realized that some flexibility in the schedule when possible can go a long way helping the work-life balance. AvalonBay is not perfect and there are issues here just like any other company. One of the key differences I have seen at AvalonBay is Management (starting at the top) is aware of the issues and is actively trying to fix them. They really do listen to the Associates and they take their feedback very seriously. This was evident when Executive Management conducted a series of town hall meetings across the company to meet with and talk open with Associates at all levels.,The path for advancement is not always clear and is not always up.

Unfortunately if you do something small to make someone mad forget getting promoted ever! Once you have done anything small to upset someone then they will pretty much blacklist you forever. I worked for the company for over 3 years and wanted to move up and got over looked for promotions for people that had been with the company a significant amount of time less than me. The company if also full of gossipers, so I highly recommend that you keep things to yourself. The bonus structure with the company sucks, of you are at a stabilized community you make a measly $75 per lease and after tax it is around $50 which for all of the work you have to do for your move-ins it doesn't make it worth it.

Used to be a great company,2.0,"Aug 26, 2022",My team/direct peers are the only reason I have continued to stay as long as I have.,"- Communities are incredibly understaffed, leading to significant burn out and severely increased work load. Operating on skeleton crews began in 2019 and have continued to reduce year over year. - Associates are grossly underpaid for the amount of work that they do. Associate recognition and resident retention budgets are also gutted year over year. - Senior management claims to value their associates but it is smoke and mirrors. If you’re not a shareholder, you do not matter. - Benefits are outdated, no longer competitive and could use serious improvement. Associates deserve much more paid time off, a higher 401k match and a higher associate housing discount, especially when SO much of our paychecks are being invested back into a company who doesn’t care about us. - Associates are asked to complete a lot of surveys throughout the year that ask for candid, honest feedback about the company but senior management responses to these surveys are incredibly underwhelming and the changes that associates ask for are not implemented. If the changes we suggest are beneficial to anyone other than our shareholder, they are disregarded.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Avalon Bay is constantly innovating and creating new ways to improve the way we perform as well as how we do business and we are compensated with lots of perks i.e. housing benefit of 20%, stock options, generous health insurance and resources to learn and improve our skills just to name a few. With this company you are empowered to not only make decisions but to take charge of your career path. Expectations are clear and associates have a good understanding of what is needed and given tools to handle those tasks.","There are very few downsides to working here. If you are someone who cannot give up having Saturdays off then an entry level position will be challenging. Growth and opportunities usually means having to relocate within your region or outside of region depending on what position you are looking for, but within this industry is pretty common. Also remember you are working with the public and that can pose it's own challenges such as upset residents and conflict resolution. More often than not these challenges are what makes our jobs exciting and not boring. Another challenge can be split days off. If you are an entry level associate you will most likely have Sunday and another day off during the week which means you rarely have 2 days off in a row. This does take some time to adjust but is also flexible in case you have an event or need to move things around.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

I believe there are 11-15 paid holidays, 11 sick days that are paid, and 2 weeks of paid vacation. It's pretty awesome. They provide you with online training in the first 90 days and continue to provide training after. I believe they also review you for a raise after a year as well. Compensation is around $14.50 hourly + commission ($75 per lease). Paychecks after tax were usually around $900, and the bonus check was usually around $2000.","Yes, training via computer is provided (but it sucks!!!) talk to any of the new hires, they are completely clueless and it honestly takes a good 4-5 months to fully grasp the concepts of apartment day-to-day business with the amount of paperwork and procedure that is needed for each task. At my particular location, simple mistakes were met with write-ups and there was no room for error. Very unforgiving. This does not seem to happen in other locations. I was micromanaged to the point where i was timed when using the restroom, and given dirty looks if i clocked in from lunch a minute late. Also, you will be written up if you think outside the box and actually try to help residents (this will be under insubordination).

The hours and inflexibility in accommodations for weekends was just beginning to take place during my departure. This, in my opinion, makes the stress of being on-site even more frustrating as the employees have been making even more concessions for the benefits of residents.

Rare Combination of Long-Term View and Strong Values,5.0,"Aug 12, 2020","AVB is unique in the real estate industry in that they develop a majority of the buildings they own (as opposed to buying them from a 3rd party), and as a REIT, they are incentivized to hold these properties long-term (10+ years). This combination allows the firm to focus on ""doing the right thing"" and building quality apartments that don't cut corners.

Avalon Bay Review,1.0,"Mar 6, 2019",I loved talking with the residents getting to know them all and understanding how to better improve their experience living here. Making residents happy to call this their home really made an impact on my confidence. I enjoyed the values and the partial training I received here. It helped me better understand what I want from a company than trying to conform to one.,"- No work-life balance even though they proudly boast it. - Transparency is of the utmost importance as I am one of the front-facing team for current residents. Trying to close loops and follow-up with residents that require assistance from other teams are close to non-existent. Many teams prefer to keep these conversations private. - Teamwork is non-existent. It is heavily segregated due how it is operated in Avalon Mission Bay. We have the Leasing/Management, Resident Support, and Maintenance teams. Maybe if the social events are inclusive to all teams and not just to one, it could have fostered better teamwork and cooperation. - Appreciation is not valued enough. Although, I understand that the leasing team ensures apartments get filled and for each apartment that gets filled they get a bonus. However, the company also focused on retaining the current resident's and improving the NPR score. Appreciations for Resident Support teams are limited to 1 person each season where they receive 1 free day-off or $100. If there were better incentives, maybe the Resident Support team wouldn't have been short-staffed (people kept quitting).","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

First, almost every person I meet here is warm, friendly, but most importantly, ethical. Everyone cared about my on-boarding experience, and my first impressions of AvalonBay as a new employee. Managers and co-workers went above and beyond to make me feel welcome throughout my first 93 days at the company. In addition, AvalonBay's dedication to their customers and employees is exactly what you would expect from a large company with the means. Not only are salaries fair as far as I can tell, but they treat their employees to birthday cakes, congratulatory meals, etc. which is a little gesture that goes a long way. They also do everything they can to make residents happy, which makes it easier and more pleasant for me to do my job. I could continue, but I think what I've already written sums it up.

Fantastic Company and Fantastic Environment,5.0,"Apr 10, 2017","-Corporate culture - AVB ensures they hire talent that is not only knowledgeable, but also has the temperament that fits into our culture embodied in our core values. There is a strong sense of dedication to the mission, and everyone is just so pleasant to work with. -Leadership - AVB's middle to upper management are conscientious leaders who understand the importance of work life balance, and foster an environment that inhibits growth within the company. I've been with the company for nearly 4 years, and I've been promoted twice. They appreciate talent within the company and do their best to hang onto that talent. -Benefits - the benefits are wonderful, from holidays/vacation days, to sick days, to 401k plans, etc. - AVB does their best to ensure they take care of their employees. They even allow for paid time off to contribute to community service organizations, and AVB makes philanthropy an important priority.

Company has been very good to its associates in the past. My director is very engaged and a true mentor. Fellow associates are very good at their jobs and make coming to work worthwhile. Pay is competitive.,Real change in management with the Archstone acquisition. Seems like upper mangement that joined last year cares less about associates. Very unfriendly and dismissive.

Avalon lives customer service with our residents and they took this same approach with associates. That has drastically changed.,"Avalonbay prides itself on inclusion and diversity but they do not practice what they preach. They implemented numerous operational changes during the pandemic. Our onsite teams showed up and ran our properties safely. We didn't have the luxury of sitting behind a keyboard working from home. We were told in late 2021 that we can no longer safely operate our communities unless we were vaccinated. Avalonbay received numerous exemption requests, I was told over 130 from HR including mine.

Upper management is full of people making decisions about day to day operations when they have no idea what a normal offices day to day looks like. ""Promotions"" are a joke and so is the way the leasing agents get paid. You will need a degree in finance to understand your paycheck and good luck getting someone to explain it to you. The insurance you get isn't very good and finding doctors in network can be very challenging.

Amazing, intelligent, and caring coworkers Management is extremely down to earth and understanding. Terrific benefits. Work is rewarding and very collaborative. Tons of company events, company truly wants you to have a work family. Interview process is long and thorough, but I can now see that this is to ensure employees fit within the company culture and have the drive to add true value to the company. If the company is a good fit, employees are more likely to have a happy work experience, and will therefore stay employed longer creating an even greater sense of a work family.","No laptops unless you travel a lot, so no opportunity to telework, which could be helpful/beneficial at times.

If experienced females are being passed up for promotions why would any female who works around them think they will be able to move up in the company.

Big company with big resources.,"There is a tremendous effort put into making things ""look good"" to the stock holders. Associates are measured so tightly to adhere to every possible metric imaginable, that the work load is completely driven by ""which team has the best numbers"". The result is an exhausting work environment that feels like the leaders are trying to get blood from a stone & don't really care about associates or residents. Also, duplicitous behavior from some of the exec team; giving directives, then passing the buck when the result doesn't pan out in their favor so they did not take the heat.

A 12% pay cut for all employees.,"New bonus structure is horrible. Level of stress has risen and it feels like we have become pushy to close leases. 12% pay cut was upsetting and more insulting is they want us to believe we can potentially make more if we hit sales goals. Sales goals are too high so I've missed goal 3 months in a row and taxed on bonuses. Associate housing treats us worse then regular residents.

I have worked for both the West and East coast regions at AvalonBay and the family/ team culture was equally displayed in both regions.

Like any corporation, especially a publicly traded REIT, it can sometimes seems like changes or approvals can take some time.

One of the largest reasons that I choose to stay are the opportunities for advancement that are available to those that seek them out. Additionally I feel that the company seeks to act morally in many aspects, such as equitable wages between male and female employees, and implementing a ""living wage"" vs a minimum wage across all positions. Another aspect is the people! Leaders are encouraged to mentor associates and share knowledge, and this just trickles down to everyone!","The tuition reimbursement could be more robust.

There is room to move laterally within the company.","- Upper management does not understand the onsite experience and cannot offer useful guidance or set realistic expectations. We were expected to request reviews and to get positive NPS results, but most residents would not recommend a community where grounds are not being kept up and the rent increases significantly every year even if their service requests are done in 3 hours. - There is often a breakdown of communication between parties (management, associates, office, maintenance, residents, vendors, etc.) which makes the job harder than it needs to be. - AvalonBay is publicly traded and has a responsibility to its shareholders, but has lost sight of the human side of this people-centered business. Upper management is more concerned with profits than its own people. The worst part was getting to know a family after leasing them an apartment for 12 months and then increasing their rent 25% if they wished to renew. - General lack of loyalty and minimal career advancement opportunities. It was more common for an associate to leave AVB for another property management company and then be rehired in a higher position with a raise than for someone to actually be promoted from within. They typically hired supervisors from outside of the company and often ended up hiring incompetent or unprofessional associates.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

"Clique-ish Culture, Promotes Corporate Brown-nosers",3.0,"Jul 15, 2015","Great benefits, matching 401k program, and chances for promotion. Base pay was average, starting at $15/hour for Leasing in the Bay Area. Lots of structure, lots of organization. Clear channels of communication between the corporate office, Customer Care Center, and other offices. Great software, Salesforce and MRI are great platforms in order to keep communication open and clear.","They expect A LOT out of an employee, which can be a good thing. Depending on the portfolio director, these expectations can be scrupulous and unrealistic. The way they treat residents is uncanny: $300 - $400 rent increases for renewals, even above going market rate is outrageous. Some community managers were horrible. They would sit in the back office and talk on the phone ALL DAY, refusing to help residents even when residents were requesting to speak to a manager. One manager in particular used to swear and speak loudly about residents in a derogatory way even when there were other people (non-staff) in the office. So horrible. Want to get promoted? Make sure to brown nose your way to the top and hang out with upper management. It's a very clique-ish culture.They say merit gets your way up towards a promotion... only if you have a manager that supports and shows an employee the tools to succeed. But mostly, it's who you turn your brown nose towards and how well you can show off. Hard work really only keeps you employed, but not necessarily promoted. In the end, the bottom line is what it comes down to: profit for stockholders.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

,3.0,"Oct 19, 2014","At first I loved my job!! Easy going, good pay, great hours, holiday time and vacation is great. Love my benefits, (I'm sure there is better but this is manageable.) Good work life balance. Company events are fun and MOST people are great to work with. Regular evaluations with pay increases (although they are rigged to cap you at a certain level of excellence for financial reasons. This is not a joke, it's been happening my entire career and when I first started I was in denial of it but now it's just getting old)","As time goes on you do more and more work outside of your ""job description"" or ""title"". This is great for development but eventually enough is enough. It makes employees feel like they are doing the job of a Community Manager (which they LITERALLY are) but just don't get paid the same or get the same benefits. The same is true for Community Consultants, several CC's take on a lot more responsibility yet can't seem to be promoted. Maintenance Supervisor's are in the same boat, usually running a property with no direction from maintenance manager or senior. Even maintenance tech positions find themselves in the same boat. Avalon keeps staffing small to keep costs down. Most of this stems specifically from ""podded"" communities. Company favors certain employees which include offering better housing discounts to one person over another. The stress of doing more than one persons job with NO thanks or recognition is becoming extremely draining.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm
A company that cares about its people,5.0,"Jun 16, 2015","I have worked for AvalonBay for a number of years and continue to be impressed with the company's commitment to its employees. Management asks for feedback on a regular basis and takes action on it. Employees are given opportunities to grow, are recognized for their efforts and are proud to work for the company.","Something is always changing (for the better) at AvalonBay, so don't apply to this company if you don't like variety and change in your work. There is also more work to get done than time in the day, so prioritization is also a key to success here.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm
Good for now.....,3.0,"Apr 2, 2016","Avalon is decent company. They are always working on improving processes and rolling out new customer service programs, etc.There is room for growth and transfer opportunities as the company is large and has properties in markets. Most paid holidays of any company I've worked for. Quarterly meetings and summer picnics with the rest of the day off are also a nice incentive.","Pay is low. If you're offered a job, negotiate your salary because it's not going up much from there once employed. I have also seen great employees be pushed out of the company by upper management.

"I love my job, but the pay makes me question if it's worth it.",3.0,"Aug 1, 2020","I have been an associate at AvalonBay for quite some time and I have to say that I do love my job. There are multiple opportunities for growth, and the company and management teams want their associates to be successful. They've handled COVID-19 incredibly well from a safety standpoint and I'm grateful for that. We receive good benefits (health insurance, 401k, 20% off of rent if you live in an AvalonBay Community, etc.), and they have standard, but still good, time off policies. My teammates and almost every single associate I've met so far are incredible people, and they make this job better and I am happy to come to work because of them. I have the opportunity to make a difference in my residents' lives, which I love, and I have a lot of power to make my own decisions in how I work with my residents from a customer service standpoint. Finally, there is definitely flexibility in my position to take on projects and make them my own, from planning resident events to coordinating new programming and more.","Simply put, no matter how much I do love my job and where I work, I don't make nearly enough to live at any of our Communities, even with a 20% discount, and still have enough money in my budget for expenses for food, utilities, transportation, and to put enough money in my savings account every month (this doesn't even take my student debt into consideration, let alone other expenses). Unfortunately, this describes not only living on my own at one of our communities, but also living with a roommate or possibly even two. My hourly rate is extremely low compared to our competitors (~$18/hour), and while our previous bonus plan provided the opportunity to make at least an additional $2,000 or more per month on average (and that is definitely the lower end of what I've seen for my bonuses), my new ""bonus"" is likely only going to be $1,000 per month - enough to cover my hourly rate's taxes. Because we are understaffed (no matter how much my manager lets higher-ups know we need another associate at my location), and even if we weren't, for the amount of work I do and the amount of energy I put into my job, as well as the amount of customers that I work with daily (including those that are immeasurably difficult to please), I question almost every day how much longer this path will be feasible for me. Aside from that, we are constantly measured by net promoter scores that are not applicable to the management staff (i.e., ""the building could use some work"", ""the rent is too high"", etc.), and when I asked who to provide feedback to about this, I was shot down because ""this has been in place for years"". Finally, on the days where I work by myself, I find that I work far more than eight hours in a day, to the point of where, for a long time, I consecutively wasn't getting back home while it was still light out. Ultimately, I feel as though I am doing the work of what a supervisor would be doing in another property management company, but in no way am I being paid a comparable amount of money to make the job and the hard work worth it. I don't want to leave AvalonBay at all, but I still often find myself checking for new job postings at other companies that may offer better pay and a better work/life balance and I plan to apply for new positions elsewhere when they open if things do not change soon.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

AvalonBay - More Pro's than Con's if you're willing to work hard!,4.0,"Jan 31, 2014","All AvalonBay Leasing Offices provide very dynamic and social atmospheres. Unlike most corporate positions, you won't sit at a window-less cube all day waiting for 5:00PM to come. Talking with prospective residents on community tours helps the day fly by and is also a great way to network. If you are an extrovert, AvalonBay is the place for you. Although many people criticize the company for high-turnover, I believe it's what you make of it. Avalon is a leader in the real estate industry and can become a crucial stepping stone for anyone interested in a career in property management. Bonuses can greatly contribute to one's overall yearly earnings and also helps to motivate employees across the board. The company also does fun events and contests throughout the year which keeps employees engaged and invested. When you spend every day making a difference in resident's lives, you enjoy your job and take great satisfaction in your day to day operations. If you are willing to work hard, AvalonBay is a great place to work.","The pay is fair (not great, but not awful) but it seems like you won't reach a higher salary too easily. Promotions are given to those who work extremely hard, but also must put in lots of overtime hours. Hours are a huge con, and most offices don't close until 6:30PM. Working Saturdays is annoying, and extremely difficult when the rest of the world is on a 9-5 Mon-Fri schedule. Dealing with disgruntled residents everyday can be taxing, but that is the nature of customer service. Vacation time could be more generous, with 2 weeks off per year and just a handful of sick days. All time off balances accrue over the year, so time off must be strategically planned.

With each move I learned more about the company and was able to grow myself, being promoted twice in the last two years. I have also utilized the 20% housing discount living in an Avalon Community ever since I started working for the company. This was not only convenient, but also helped me to better understand our customers. I have been lucky enough to work with many different co-workers and managers and have had a generally positive experience everywhere I went. I am definitely happy with my experiences at AvalonBay!","1.) Frequent and/or sudden changes in policies, procedures and compensation. 2.) The housing discount could be better 3.)

Yes there will be challenges, upsets and disappointment but getting to work with the people on AVB makes it all worth it. You get through it together and are able to celebrate the positives and learn from the negatives or mistakes together. I've been given the honor of growing with this company, being here since I was 22 years old. Growing as a person but also as a manager. A company that gives their employees this opportunity has all their employees best interests at heart.","Systems and networks are a bit lacking. We rely on our computer systems to do our jobs on a daily basis, but when they freeze or don't talk to each other it can make a simple task seem almost impossible. As I mentioned before the company really cares about their employees., however I feel that can be to a fault. I've found struggling employees sometimes get too many chances, no one wants to see someone asked to leave a job or removed from a certain position but if things are dragged out or being slipped under the rug, it only hurts the team and property more.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

I was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to come back to the AvalonBay team and could not be happier that I did. This is a company that truly cares about their associates and doesn't just talk the talk when it comes to our core values and cultural norms. There is a positive, can-do attitude that is prevalent throughout the organization. Feedback is taken seriously and actual change is implemented when it is the right thing to do. AvalonBay offers a work environment where associates are empowered to do the right thing, are supported to be successful in their role, and also to have fun while doing it. There is enormous growth opportunity and whether you are looking to move up or just gain a new experience in a different department, you can absolutely be in the driver’s seat of your career here if you want it.","As the organization is large and has so many resources, sometimes it can feel that different departments aren't working towards the same goal.

Lack Luster Compensation Plan & Autonomy,2.0,"Mar 6, 2021","There are plenty of benefits with AvalonBay. The company culture and core values are strong and respectable. Business is conducted ethically, making AvalonBay a company you can speak proudly about working for. The fringe benefits are a nice touch, but not a selling feature. Throughout 2020, the company grew its internal commitment to inclusion and diversity with an expansion of new resource groups. The most substantial perk is the vacation accrual increase the longer you are with the company; this is a core reason why I am still with the company. The on-site teams you work with make all the difference in the world. If I weren’t for them becoming a work family the associate turnover would be higher than it already is.","I will omit the 2020 COVID-19 response from my review, other than to say the expectations of employees showed the company’s true colors for associate appreciation. At the end of 2020, each associate was given a Challenge Coin and $100 as a “Thank You.” Excuse me for being ungrateful, but it was a slap in the face from the VP executive team and above after the year we all endured. Not familiar with a Challenge Coin? Lookup how many Donald Trump had displayed in his office. The emotional value meant nothing to the on-site teams who received them since they are handed out like candy. Compare this to countless other property management companies who awarded their associates a minimum of $1,000 each. Staying on the topic of financial recognition and compensation, this is the greatest area of opportunity for associate satisfaction. Approximately every year or two, AvalonBay conducts an Associate Perspective Survey to solicit direct feedback. While this is a commendable gesture to do the right thing, there have been zero questions asked about compensation over the years, yet it is the highest written in response year over year. As an adult well out of college years it is embarrassing that a company in the housing industry does not pay their associates enough to live on-site at the communities they help keep occupied. Living paycheck to paycheck should not be a reality of the people who run the success of their business day to day. You are expected to achieve more with less resources and tools, staffing levels are a joke. It is hard to watch the on-site Managers work magic to achieve success while burning themselves out. Work life balance is non-existent and quarterly performance-based compensation is not paid timely. In the last year, the quarterly bonus for Supervisors and Managers (both office and maintenance) was paid late 3 times, once being 3 pay periods (6 weeks) late. Also, do not get used to the compensation plan because it changes (for the worse) every year. They like to pretend you have the autonomy to do your job and make decisions independently, but I have seen my manager be told outright a person of higher position can out rule their decision ""because they can."" AvalonBay, it is time for YOU to act like the owners and show the same commitment and dedication to your staff as your on-site associates do for residents, vendors, and peers.

The supervisors are very focused on job growth and getting you where you need to be to move up in your position. -There are lots of opportunities to try new things and explore different facets of the company which always keeps things interesting. -There is a lot of promoting from within which is encouraging to see. -My supervisors aren't super strict when it comes to an exact time to be in every day as long as I'm getting my work done and not missing meetings.

Everyone is very flexible with taking time off, taking off for a bit during the day for personal reasons, etc. -I always look forward to coming to work. My job here challenges me and is always making me push forward which I find very valuable. -The vacation time policy is pretty good. 2 weeks starting out and then after 4 years it goes to 3 weeks and then there are more days as your tenure increases from there. -The corporate offices have all been pretty dated and they have recently been moving and upgrading all of the offices. It may not seem like much - but its nice to come in to a shiny new office instead of one stuck in the 90s. -The rent discount is pretty good (20% off market) if you want to live at a community. And most of our community are pretty awesome (new or recently renovated) so that is a huge bonus.","-Technology - people still use Lotus Notes? But after a week you are used to it. They have released new tools like Chatter (almost like a Twitter just for the company) which is new and exciting and our virtual magazine is cool. -Avalon doesn't pay super well - and its something they don't seem afraid to tell people. When you have your review and they tell you they don't give raises (base raise) based on the cost of living and if you live at a community they are most likely raising your rent more than you are getting in a raise - something doesn't add up there...Its really about finding the right balance between enjoying where you work, having a flexible schedule and opportunity for growth. Another company may pay more, but you may not find the same culture there that you have here. Hourly corporate associates are pretty much the only people in the company that aren't eligible for bonuses which is frustrating for many people. However, the fact that they tend to promote from within and really value their associates offsets some of these frustrations and makes you work harder towards getting to that next level. -The maternity leave policy isn't awesome - 6 weeks and they force you to use all of your vacation days...but if you can afford to take more time off, it seems they are very open to that and will work with you.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

"A company with heart, a vision to create great environment for employees and residents!",5.0,"May 8, 2019","The regional management team in Northern California is caring and experienced (a couple directors have over 15 years with Avalon Bay). They create an environment of openness and accessibility that is refreshing and encouraging. I really, really like the local people on the maintenance and sales/management teams on our property. We've had a couple meaningful team-building meetings during the past year that's helped create connections of care and respect. It's a pleasure to come to work each day knowing that my day will be filled with pleasant interactions with my team as we work together serving our residents. The training for new hires is extensive and excellent. The training director in our region is a dynamo of energy and encouragement. The training events early in my employment created opportunities to meet other employees in similar roles and build relationships. The company also provides seasonal events for all employees in our region where several hundred team members gather for awards, fun, and food. The management appreciates the local staff people and it shows through these kinds of events. Some properties take Sunday off. That is definitely a positive factor in creating work/life balance. I get one day at home for family activities and another weekday for personal projects and appointments. People stay with this company - our property's maintenance manager has been here 19 years! Other maintenance staff have been at this property for 8 and 15 years. That is phenomenal - these people are pros and the company has taken care of them in a way to keep them happy! I have seen lots of people promoted over the past year! Four people on our local management team were promoted to positions with more responsibility (and they all deserved it!). Their replacements were all internal company moves filled by well-qualified people. Nice to see upward mobility for those seeking to move their careers forward! The company is large enough to be investing in innovation and improvements to the properties and our work tools. A new software application has contributed to making postings to Craigslist almost automatic. It was tested in two regions first, so the roll-out was smooth and well-planned. The benefits are great. The vision plan (VSP) is generous, new frames and lenses each year! It's easy to get a day off at my property because we have a large staff. After a year here, I haven't had a vacation day request denied.","After listing all the positive things above, anything I could add to this section is petty in comparison! There is always room for improvement but there's also hope that consideration will be given when appropriate. I think the company pays about on par with the industry. It would be nice if wages were on the higher side of the scale.

"Complete Waste of Two Years, Advancement is Non-Existant",1.0,"Aug 10, 2016",The team at my property was great. Solid benefits.,"Ladies, you know that one relationship you regret. You wasted a two years on a guy hoping that someday (SOMEDAY) he would appreciate how wonderful and talented you were, how smart you were, how much you took tasks on that he'd never had to worry about, how little you asked for in return...how much you really cared. How LOYAL you were. Welcome to my relationship with AvalonBay. If AvalonBay were a boyfriend, I should have dumped his worthless behind long ago. I interviewed with multiple years experience in property management under my belt, coming from a management role. I accepted an entry level sales position with assurances of quickly forthcoming advancement that never materialized (all the while watching non-industry, outside candidates be placed straight into management). Lots of favoritism for the corporate brown nosers at this company. Watch out for those people because they will quietly stab you in the back to look golden to management -- also to hold you down because they're terrified you'll leap-frog them a promotion. Once that happens, you can forget about any kind of advancement. As others have mentioned, if you're not a POD favorite you may as well start seeking alternate employment. Pay at AVB was always low for the respective industry but now they've introduced a sparkly new compensation program that they've billed as our opportunity to make more bonus. In short, they reduced the hourly pay of all employees by 12% (with the exception of managers, of course) in exchange for what they claim is a massive opportunity to make more bonus on leases. Best wishes to AVB hiring good talent at $13 an hour because this bonus structure only benefits the company, not the employees. And good luck finding a manager who can actually even explain the bonus calculator in a transparent way. Smoke and mirrors. What AVB's essentially done is create a culture of teams scrambling, clawing and stepping on each other to claim the best leads and making shady exceptions to get leases on the board -- I mean, if the Senior CC's going to hold out an apartment seven days instead of the mandated three, why wouldn't I? #GREAT Additionally, the bonus goals are set borderline unattainable, so corporate, who set them, is banking on one or more consultant on a team missing in any given month. What's that mean for shareholders? $$$$$ Yup. Hey investors, hope you're enjoying riding the backs of AVB livestock! Avalon employs corporate sheep for a reason. Plod along, don't ask questions, don't challenge authority, brown nose at every turn, do your manager's work, accept pay decreases with a smile. Bow to corporate. Bow to abusive residents. Get this! Our manager was so afraid to get a bad review on social media that he actually waived a person's move-out charges to get them to remove a one-star Yelp. How do you look up to or aspire to be a manager like that??? Cute for a company that benchmarks integrity as a core value, isn't it?

But, that's a big ""might""","This is a very large corporation and you should know this coming in. Employees are numbers and this company tries very hard to say they're customer service focused, but the bottom line is just that...the bottom line. Money and making your numbers is most important!! If you're doing well, then you have to better, they tell you, because you now have to make up for the properties not doing well and when AVB makes a promise to their shareholders, about how much MORE revenue they'll make year-over-year, then gosh-darn it, they will make those numbers at all costs!! I read other reviewers commenting on the high increases they give residents. That's an understatement! They HAVE to make more and more money so residents be damned, either pay or get out!! Employees....don't like it? Then get out! HR says they ""care"" about employees opinions, but no way. I see the responses, on these reviews, saying how they care about our feelings and really hope we go tell someone our concerns. Do that and your a gonner! Once you're pegged as being a problem, they start the documentation trail (written counselings) and then you're out. And I've seen people comment about this being a gossip friendly company. Oh boy is it!! This company should have it's own reality show. It's funny, vicious, sad and downright deplorable! And the pay....haven't even talked about that!! Have you heard about the new bonus plan. They'll scream at you about how you can ""make 3-times your bonuses"", but that's not true. You take a 12.5% hourly PAYCUT for this new plan too! So you make even less money (which was pretty low even in this industry) and you MAY or MAY NOT make your goals. If your goal is to get 8 leases and you get 3 then your get NOTHING!!! And this is happening all over the place. So, now they've turned us into money-grubbing back-stabbing nutballs trying to steal leases from each other. It's really disgusting!

Things have changed,1.0,"Apr 19, 2022",On site teams and benefits.,"The NY/Westchester leadership is a disappointment and does not live up to the ""cultural norms"" and ""family"" environment this company has promoted for so long. This includes HR, directors, and general managers. The empathetic allyship and initiaves they push are only to check boxes with no real intention of making the necessary connections. I strongly advise associates not to use ""radical candor"" as anything you say can and will most definitely be used against you. The company as a whole, is only concerned with its corporate citizenship as proven by its politics, ultimatums and termination of associates that were once considered heroes. An audacious move dictated by its majority stockholders under the guise of employee safety which resulted in alienation, toxicity, and low morale. The onsite teams are underpaid and over worked while expected to provide free marketing by pushing 5 star reviews for an average product with classless residents. As with all REITs, every property is ultimately for sale so there really isn't job security on a site level, especially in CT/NY/Westchester. Expect business managers who are selfish overachievers that only care about results and do not like feedback or pushback. Expect retalition disguised as false allegations and wrongful terminations. Expect mixed messaging from yes men/women who are traitorous. Expect disrespect and maltreatment from customers in sometimes unsafe enviroments with no consequences. Do not expect people managers and leaders who put their teams first. Do not expect to work at a luxury site with a clientele that will respect the staff. Do not expect a balanced family/work life as work schedules do not coincide with family needs.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm
"Fake company, fake people!",1.0,"Jul 8, 2015","Not much. You get apaycheck, but you can get one elsewhere too!","I work in the LA area and OMG has this company changed! A couple of years ago Avalon took over part of a company, Archstone, that did so bad it went out of business! Well, someone didn't tell the former Archstone employees this. They feel they took over Avalon and they just came in with all sorts of ideas about how to change the company. And the executives are actually allowing it. It's like they feel bad for this company, and it's crazy-paid employees, and are giving them cart blanche to do what they want. They all came in with much higher titles and higher pay and they don't know nearly as much as the current Avalon people. We all couldn't believe our eyes and ears! Major animosity going on! The executives are just out of control. What are they looking for in LA? Well, let's just say they like their ""leasing girls"" to be quite pretty and look darn good. Curled hair, makeup, and the kind that can 'attract new residents'. The regionalmanagers are just awful! Mean-spirited, belittling and always on you to get your numbers. It reminds me of used car sales. If you don't get your numbers, they write the heck up out of you and then will just fire you! This has happened to SEVERAL associates. It's very sad. Good people, doing thier best, but just tossed out. They want these great numbers because they want thier big bonuses. Yes, this is true. These people get big bonuses and you better not be in the way of them getting it. This company experiences so much turn over, they know they'll just find some other slob, and then work them to death. And then make them feel soooo lucky to be working for this company. They pretty much brainwash you into thinking this is the best company and you should feel so lucky. And then you aren't supposed to ask for raises or promotions. Again, very sad indeed. The LA region is a very stressful region for sure and you really have to have some major thick skin to work here. They definitely have their favorites for sure too.

Onsite Support is Forgotten,1.0,"Sep 14, 2020",I really like most of the people I interact with at this company. Many have become friends in my personal life and the rest are fairly easy to get along with.,"Our onsite teams need more support. It feels like we're constantly fighting tooth and nail to make a tiny bit of progress on something that will make our jobs easier, but senior leadership refuses to listen. They're not here working onsite with us and I know several other managers have complained about the same issues, but our legitimate concerns constantly fall on deaf ears. We recently had to downsize our onsite teams in exchange for AI doing parts of our job... except AI has been less than successful and several of our processes still require human support. We've been stretched very thin with longer working hours/extended work weeks and corporate refuses to allow us to hire appropriate staffing. So far this only applies to the office side but maintenance isn't far behind. As soon as they realize they can cut corners with our maintenance team, they'll be impacted by this ""skeleton crew"" staffing model just as badly (if not worse) as the office has been. Lastly, the communication from other departments is terrible. This company claims to have a core value of ""We Collaborate"" but here's what really happens: some department from corporate makes a new company initiative that impacts onsite teams. There's a training call for the new initiative on a Tuesday. It rolls out on Wednesday. Missed the training call? Eh, you'll figure it out because SURELY someone else on your team was on the call and can support you in getting up to speed... even though they themselves had less than 24 hours to absorb the information. All in all, there is a lack of transparency and strategic planning. Corporate will just schedule another ""change management"" call that all of us have to dial into and get no real value from the conversation.","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Toxic Workplace - It's All About Who You Know!,1.0,"Jan 15, 2021",Another employer with health benefits.,"Working onsite at communities has taken a toll on moral over the years. The RS leadership constantly makes adjustments to the leasing bonus plan, decreasing pay and incentives, while increasing the workload and reducing staff. Total disregard for ""nonessential employees"", such a leasing consultants, maintenance technicians, concierges, etc., while working onsite amid the global pandemic crisis as the corporate office employees and POD's work remotely and safely in the comfort of their home constantly pressuring the ""nonessential employees"" to do more, do better, exceed lease goals, increase NPS scores, increase Google reviews, etc. The pressure is unreal. Leasing team members are doing triple times the work in order to bring home a decent paycheck. There was once a time leasing consultants could make over $2k as a leasing bonus for 14+ leases, but now with all the changes to the bonus plan, they make approximately $45 per lease. Less pay and more work for a measly $45 bucks per lease? Make it, make sense. Community managers receive no proper training and are unskilled in human relations. The company will only promote employees in ""workplace cliques."" If you are a quiet, intelligent, and a hard worker, you will NOT get promoted. If you are highly extroverted, a know-it-all, and like to dabble in brown-nosing and gossip, then BINGO, you'll get promoted. Employees who have been at the company for years, who apply for a promotion will most likely not get selected. The company will rather hire external employees, choosing to spend more time, energy, and money in training new hires, rather then give a loyal and committed employee a new opportunity and chance at growing within the company - an employee who will most likely end up having to train the new external hire for a position they were perfectly qualified to receive.

Not A Company I Could Recommend,1.0,"Jan 1, 2016",Amazing staff to work with on a daily basis(They deserve 5 stars) Sundays closed Ideal for those with retail experience,"I was very excited when Avalon took over our company because it was stated over and over that they would be very similar. I was also excited to have Sundays off and be a part of a company that I could grow in. Fast forward a couple years later and the only word that comes to mind is disappointment. Prior to Avalon, I had a clear idea of my ""road map to success"" and upper management was amazing. I could call her for anything and she genuinely cared about me not just as an employee but as a person. Upper management here left something to be desired to say the least. I consider myself a team player and love to do what is needed to reach a goal but I felt unmotivated at this company. Having quarterly meetings was simply a ra-ra show and the things that mattered were pushed behind. Things as simple as employees having a clear road map toward moving up in the company were talked about but never executed during my time there. I watched exceptional employees question their worth because individuals in upper management didn't really see the importance of knowing their employees in their region. I found myself seeing Avalonbay more and more like a job instead of a career and I knew if I wanted to grow in the way that I wanted, I would need to look elsewhere. The only thing that kept me there were my managers at my communities and the individuals I worked with on a daily basis. My experience with them was phenomenal and If I were to base my review off of them, it would be a different story. I also think a big con is the lack of compassionate for the residents that the staff deals with on a daily basis. Avalon is like any other big company and it is all about the bottom line. Resident retention was not that important even though it made more sense to keep someone in their apartment as opposed to paying the money to turn it or risking an apartment remaining vacant for months. One of the best things I experienced was forming great relationships with individuals and one of the worst was having to watch people leave a community they called home (for as long as 20 years in some cases) because the numbers from a system didn't work in their favor. We had residents that were retired, living on a fixed income, and getting ridiculous increases. While I understand the business side, it is very different when you have to be the one being yelled out or watching someone cry because they can no longer make ends meet. Unfortunately, the list can go on of why I chose to move on and I would not personally recommend this company from my experiences .","AvalonBay Communities, Inc.",AVB,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/AvalonBay-Communities-Reviews-E2616.htm

Very disappointed,1.0,"Aug 1, 2018",Very organized processes and policies. Lots of company sponsored lunches known affectionately as associate appreciation. If you want to learn how to spin and fake it until you make it this would be a great place to start out. Tons of google and glass door reviews for you to read through if you're looking to get some direction on if it's worth it or not. This goes for residents and employees.,"Nepotism is like a widespread disease there. No support from management it's an every man for himself kind of environment. Bonus/commissions system is designed to get the maximum amount of work/production out of you for the least amount of money. They set lofty and often times blatantly unattainable goals and act surprised when employees don't achieve them and subsequently don't get paid commissions or bonuses. This includes both the management and maintenance sides of the business. This is seen in areas such as NPS scores, leasing/renewal bonuses/Mid Lease surveys/ORM goals etc. If you enjoy being treated like a product, commodity, or an easily expendable asset of low value this is the place for you. Policy is king here but only where it serves someone's agenda, usually someone in management. There is NO accountability so more tenured employees get away with murder because they know they can. They will teach you to ""act like an owner"" and be ""autonomous"" however every time you do your decisions or actions will be called into question. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians to put it simply. If a resident has an issue with a rule/policy/fee all they have to do is threaten to contact the media or an attorney and Avalon will give them whatever they desire so good luck enforcing anything that is contested. They collect top dollar in rents, nickel and dime the extra fees and have astronomical rent increases. Try having conversation after conversation explaining to residents that they have a 15/18/20/25/30% rent increase for their same old apartment which hasn't all of a sudden learned a new trick and morphed into the Ritz Carlton. They build with the CHEAPEST materials they can find from china and the like and do not care about the quality provided to residents. Read some resident google reviews and notice a common thread about high rent increases, noise complaints, move out charges, cheap, looks good at first, not worth the money, buyer beware etc. They will quickly try to cover up any discrepancies or mistakes and routinely mislead residents or falsify information to avoid exposure such as issues with bugs, smoking, noise, ""mildew or discoloration"" aka MOLD. That's just a glimpse into some of the fun things you will enjoy with your belly full of ""associate appreciation"" aka ""free food"". Keep in mind Avalon Bay is a top real estate investment trust or REIT and they can afford it but it's a tax write off just like that 20% associate housing discount. They are raking in $2-5 billion annually according to Glassdoor and their premier ""Pro"" amongst a hefty list of Cons if you read the other reviews is ""good food"". What I will say is that if you are looking to build your resume this would be a great pit stop as it is a brand name. Like most brand names there is a certain level of buyer ignorance that goes hand and hand with brand recognition. Many places will hire you simply from seeing the Avalon name on your resume because Avalon Bay has an expert marketing department which knows that image is everything so they make sure everyone at the company is drinking the Koolaid so to speak. If you don't drink up then you don't last. If you last you recruit others to drink the koolaid too. Rinse and repeat. Fold in some act responsibly Spirit of caring code of ethics propaganda and there you have it.

"More of The Same, But From One of The Best...",1.0,"May 1, 2017","On-site Teams - have the potential to be truly great. On-site managers have the ability to create a positive work environment, and buy lots of food for everyone. Customer Focus - for the most part we are empowered to make resident's lives better, assist with issues that come up, and close the loop. In most cases, were I an apartment renter, I'd absolutely rent with AvalonBay. WAG, fit, etc. - promoting basics makes sure on-site teams are delivering with a sense of consistency, and are being held accountable by residents. New Ideas - they will try almost anything, but don't adopt immediately. Values and Norms - on paper, these are great. They actually line up pretty much with what I believe in, so it makes it a bit easier. Colleagues - many people in your same role are decent, helpful, and fun people. You can always reach out, and bounce ideas off of them.","I spent a few weeks rewriting this review, as I didn't want it to be knee-jerk, or completely negative, the one star is because most of the dissatisfaction comes down to decisions, which ultimately are ill conceived, and improperly executed. I believe these decision points are when the true test of our character is revealed, oftentimes the end result is safe, regressive, and benefits only a few. I write this part with a bit of a broken heart, and a somewhat foolish idea that this feedback could make a difference... I can't imagine it's like this just on the West Coast. Big on Phrases - not so much on action, or acknowledgement (""Keep doing what you're doing."", ""Thank you for all that you do.""), when you hear that, and you're not moving anywhere in the company, it sends mixed messages. These are usually said at large company events, or in passing in the rare occasion your superior takes time to meet with you. The first time you hear it, it makes you feel good, after that, it's just empty words coming from someone who doesn't really understand what it is that you do. Experience vs. Development - experience is sought in lieu of actual development. Upper management would much rather have you tread water, and struggle rather than actually teach you something, or help you develop into a new role. I guess through this struggle you ""develop"" into a better associate? Maybe, but focusing skills, and incorporating new ideas is also pretty key. They claim to have talent meetings, but haven't seen much come from them. Developing yourself is pretty much the only thing you've got, besides trainings, and meetings that don't offer much. Others have mentioned they're good at counseling which is true, but coaching is almost non-existent, and counseling without coaching is pointless. Tenure - is a key factor in promotions. If you've been there a while, they kind of just ""take care of you"". If you actually contribute, and work hard, and are looking for that promotion, you can actually be better than another candidate with more tenure, and tenure seems to trump, have observed this many times. It's easy to choose something familiar, but paying attention to what someone is actually doing in terms of output is a bit more important. Political, or personal decisions are made in promotions, but management is too scared to actually acknowledge this, and makes up a reason so far from the truth to explain it. When this happens, it leaves you frustrated, and conflicted. Just be real with people. Compensation Plan Rollout - sales goals, and metrics were introduced. Overall a great, and logical idea. One of the more progressive moves AVB had made. Part of this was that Sales and Service Supervisors were given a target dollar amount once the community goal was hit, but there wasn't clarification as to whether they would get individual payouts for leases they actually got themselves. Since this wasn't obvious, or spelled out, the company sent out a ""reminder"" email (not sure how you pass it off as a reminder if it's the first time you're hearing about it) stating an SSS would NOT be eligible for individual bonuses. This upset a lot of people, rightly so. It's money. It's their livelihood. No one acknowledged the error, and just acted as if. A simple apology would have gone a long way. Bad Management Decisions - have seen some absolute monsters be put in charge of communities, and/or other managers as directors. When I say monsters, I mean people with pure ego, no people skills whatsoever, and engage in behavior that caused associates to leave the company. It's true. They do personality assessments upon hire, but in many cases people must just be ignoring the results, or they're not very telling. Had a manager who rarely ever put their phone down, even when having a conversation with me. Colleagues - tying into the above, have had conversations with colleagues that left me questioning why they're here. They say very mean, and inconsiderate things about their staff, but do nothing to engage them. They also feel that associates should just ""know"" things, instead of taking the time to lead by example and actually teach, and engage them. Packages - the company's response to the absolutely overwhelming demand has been sluggish, and an afterthought. They claim to have knowledge of future trends, etc., but didn't see e-commerce coming? Even as they're building new communities? Get ready to be blamed, get yelled at, and receive non-stop calls and emails asking where the package that hasn't been delivered yet is, if you can leave it out, or other accommodations. They heavily downplay this problem, it bogs staff down, when they should be focusing on sales goals, and other, more meaningful customer service. Podding - they claim it's for ""development"" and ""growth"" purposes, but it's really just to save money on a salary, and make some poor soul's life miserable. They do it to the most nonsensical properties too. It's bad for business, bad for coverage, and bad for residents. Not all, but most. Politics - perhaps egotics is better to say. If you don't buy into the absolute BS (and that's what it is, it's not strategy, or anything like that) that your POD is selling you, then they make certain to punish you by simply ignoring you. The egos about are fragile, but in full-force. I've rarely seen a decision made that actually is based on merits, and logic. Every company has a clique, AVB is no exception.
