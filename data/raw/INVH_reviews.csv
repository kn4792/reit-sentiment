RED FLAG CENTRAL,1.0,"Nov 19, 2025",Fancy new office. Free crappy coffee and snacks.,"My experience in this department was not positive. Leadership style was extremely controlling and did not allow team members the autonomy to grow or contribute meaningfully. Turnover within the team was very high, which created instability and low morale.

Money isnt everything....,3.0,"Mar 5, 2025","The position offers competitive compensation and flexibility. The time-off structure is favorable, and there appears to be a collaborative work environment where colleagues support one another.","The organization lacks a robust advocacy for professional development. The absence of a clear developmental program for employees may foster an environment of complacency. Furthermore, the lack of standardized performance metrics for employees is notable. The work environment primarily focuses on completing daily tasks and addressing immediate needs, which can lead to subjective performance evaluations during annual reviews rather than assessments based on standardized criteria. The absence of streamlined processes potentially limits employee efficiency and may result in significant confusion. The overall atmosphere appears to be lacking in inspiration and positivity, with employees often seeming fatigued and unenthusiastic.

They want the tasks done quickly and get mad when they are not done correctly, but they do not take responsibility for their mistakes. Your director/manager passes the pressure/stress from their superiors down to you. They are stuck in old corporate beliefs/rules when they provide to be innovative.

Employees feel as though they have to walk on eggshells around her, afraid of her. It is not uncommon to witness her demeaning and disrespectful treatment of others, yet they continue to endure it without speaking up.

Urgent Attention Needed: Concerns About Office Environment,1.0,"May 9, 2024",While the pros of working here had been highlighted as the flexibility of hours that is no longer the case.,"There has been a noticeable shift since the change in leadership, leading to a toxic work culture that is becoming increasingly difficult to overlook. Employees who have raised valid concerns have been disregarded, with dismissal and reassurances that time will resolve the challenges associated with change. However, it is important to note that the issue lies not in the change itself, as our team has always adapted well to new circumstances, but rather in the negative impact of the new leader's management style. The current office atmosphere is marred by favoritism, micromanagement, and a pervasive sense of fear and anxiety. The authoritative approach to leadership, characterized by intimidation and a lack of openness to diverse perspectives, is creating a hostile work environment where employees feel reluctant to voice their opinions for fear of reprisal. This dictatorial management style is overshadowing the collaborative and growth-oriented culture that was fostered by our previous leader. Moreover, it seems that there is now more emphasis on maintaining appearances within the office rather than addressing the fundamental issues that affect our business's success. The lack of focus on market-driven strategies and individual growth is leading to a sense of disillusionment among the team. As someone who values this company and the positive work environment we once had, I feel compelled to raise these concerns with the hope that appropriate action can be taken to address these issues. I believe that with the right leadership and support, we can regain the enthusiasm and productivity that defined our workplace in the past. I urge you to consider the detrimental impact of the current situation on employee morale and the overall success of our business. It is my sincere hope that proactive measures will be taken to restore a more collaborative, inclusive, and growth-oriented culture within our office.",Invitation Homes,INVH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Invitation-Homes-Reviews-E666277.htm

Any HR questions I may have are easily accessible and if I can't find it myself, I can email someone who responds almost immediately. There are regular Zoom and/or ""Teams"" meetings where we identify issues and work through them. Every week there is a company wide meeting where every employee is made aware of the companies vision and goals, in addition to where we currently stand. In the short time I've been there, I've had great interaction with the team and find it refreshing to work with people who display a high level of professionalism while at the same time are willing to take a moment to have fun and light hearted conversation that has made me feel genuinely welcomed to the team.

Take it from someone who spent many years helping pave the way for IH's future workforce, if you're looking for a job that's one dimensional, or won't require you to perform, IH is not the place for you. There's going to be lots (and lots) of volume but if you can manage it and find your flow you'll never be bored lol, seriously you'll have a long career with loads of job security. You'll also learn a ton about real estate and property management and accomplish things you didn't even know you were capable of.","1) In the larger markets, IH really needs more middle management roles.

Management is terrible, they treat their employees like dirt. Other employees will constantly throw each other under the bus to avoid being blamed for something they are personally at fault for. Also, don't ever expect a raise. The salaries aren't exactly terrible, but you will be doing far more work than you will be compensated for. Don't expect much over-time either, they frown upon that very much. They will hire just about anyone who comes in for an interview regardless of qualifications.

Maintenance working for Maintenance,5.0,"Jun 19, 2021","I've been in multifamily housing for over 14 years, 10 as a supervisor on different properties. I've dealt with the on-call the pushy managers, the constant feeling of never catching up and repetition of the same thing at the same place everyday. It's what I knew and honestly something I am good at. I was extremely nervous and a bit apprehensive about switching to a newish career field. The first few weeks were odd while I was waiting for the ball to drop doing paperwork and training. Then I got my van, then I got my schedule, I had a few hiccups but then found out if you ask for help here you get it! The support system is amazing with invitation, It's corporate but a corporate that I never imagined, they send out surveys but then you see things change with your input. Not only that but maintenance is actually its own department, There is NO ONE TELLING you to do or how to do your job that hasn't done it before. It's an amazing breath of fresh air. There is still on-call here but you go months in between your on-call vs once a month or more. All of the on-call is filtered through the supervisors so you rarely hear anything. This company allows and promotes you having a personal life!!! They trust you here, there's no micromanagement and again the greatest thing if you ask for help you get it. You have two amazing supervisors that are constantly available for advice or to jump in and lend a hand and phenomenal Regional that is involved with all of it. Again the regional started as a maintenance tech, so you really do have people that understand your job here helping you with it, Not barking at you how to do it!!! This is a good company it's big enough for room for advancement and they recognize when you bust your butt and do a good job. Most of the time these reviews only come from two types of people those that are bitter or those that get roped into them. If you take this job you will end up working together with me as well as a great team of techs. I'll tell you the same thing. Again, I cant stress enough that this company actually wants you to have a life and does everything possible to make sure your time is your time!",There's still on call but it's minimal (really minimal),Invitation Homes,INVH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Invitation-Homes-Reviews-E666277.htm

There is a general fear of making decisions by management due to micromanaging from upper-management. Pass the buck is the name of the game. They promote a lot of people because they are good at their job and you end up having a case of ""promoted to your level of incompetence."" The corporate culture is not very welcoming. Teams don't interact much with each other, so unless you are part of one of the bigger ones you work on your little island. Poor communication leads to duplicate work between teams. Project management for large initiatives consists of throwing everyone and the kitchen sink into a project and scheduling hundreds of hours for meetings in people's calendar when 90% of the people don't have relevant input for the project.

"BIASED, UNBALANCED, SLAVE DRIVERS.",1.0,"Apr 1, 2016","I really wish I had something good to type in this box but really there are zero pros to working here. Hours: Horrible Pay: Horrible for the amount of work and hours put in. Medical Benefits: Too expensive/ very high deductibles and co-pays. Vacation & Paid time off: They are generous with the time but when do you have the time to use it? Even if you are off, you still have to work and residents don't care that you are off. Work Environment: Hostile and highly stressful.","This place will suck the life out of you and you'll want to wake up hoping it was all a dream. Sadly, once you're filing for a divorce, your kids stop respecting you because you're never home and your only friends are the people you work with, then you realize this place has totally ruined your life. However, its perfect for someone who likes a highly stressful work environment and is forced to work 60+ hours a week or more. Since employees under the POD are hourly employees, whatever work they didn't complete, the POD will need to complete or you will get written up and eventually fired if your manager has it out for you. POD's are salaried employees so there is no over time pay and absolutely no time for lunch but they do get bonuses. The bonuses are a joke and the expectations are very vague. One of the bonuses is supposed to be based on performance over a certain time but no one really knows how much time or how they are calculated. They have designed the bonus structure in a way that no one knows exactly how much they will receive. Oh and if you get fired, you don't get the bonus you worked so hard for because ""you have to be employed on the day the bonus checks are handed out"" This is totally against the law! The other bonus is based on renewals but you can only collect a bonus if you renew more than half of your renewals for a particular month. So if you have 80 renewals in a month, and you only renew 40, there's no bonus for you or anyone on your team that month but if the next month only has 20 renewals and you renew all 20, then you get paid on 9 of them. Sounds fair, huh? You will also have about 1000 properties in your portfolio or more as they fire other POD's adding more to your plate, making it almost impossible to catch up with anything. You are also required to put out fires on files that a previous POD never handled. The main phone is constantly ringing off the hook with angry residents complaining about maintenance issues that in most cases are not fixed because the maintenance department pushes the issues off on the POD to approve. I would never recommend anyone to rent from IH either. The lease application process a joke and the rules changes every time someone from the corporate office in Dallas would come to visit.

"Out of all the companies I have worked for, this is the worst one yet.",1.0,"Mar 6, 2015","I liked some of my co- workers and benefits were pretty good with three options. When this office first started in 2012 it was really fun, it turned south in the Fall of 2014.","Working here was great in the beginning. We were a team and everyone got along. This branch is on it's third President, and the management team under him has sucked all the fun out. A lot of people would still be there if it wasn't for them. I will focus on the last 6 months of 2014 as this is the time when most people didn't like it here. This is place is terrible, absolutely terrible. It is terrible because of the management team. Slowly local management got there way by firing the people they had a personal problem with, but found a lousy excuse to fire them. Now and then, we would see someone get escorted out and no one knew why. Lies were made or bogus reasons to fire someone. People were just waiting for there number to be called, and you just hoped management didn't have a problem with you. You kept you head down and made sure their numbers looked good. Rehab got (and still does) the blame for almost everything. Somehow it was always that departments fault, even if they had absolutely no control over the situation. A manager was let go for some made up reason. He did everything he could everyday to make everyone happy, but I guess it wasn't enough. This was another part of the plot to get the people in power that they wanted. They hired the spouse of someone in the office, which seemed weird to a lot of people, and that person lacked the skills needed for the position. I believe the ""Fab 5,"" finally got there way. I was lucky enough to get out. I put in my two weeks notice on a Sunday and the next morning I was brought into an office with management and they said you can leave right now. I asked why and they responded ""company policy."" I asked the national HR person, and she said this was a lie. I think management felt I would try and sabotage them, but anyone who knows me, would know I would never do that. I gave IH everything I had, worked hard everyday for two years, and this is how they treated me. I have never felt more disrespected by one person, it wasn't company policy, it was this persons personal decision to treat me this way. Never got a raise in two years, or a review.

What a joke.,1.0,"Feb 4, 2015",Benefits are okay. 401k matching is okay. The coffee is free. It's possible that you will make a friend or two amidst the negativity.,"Here's some advice for those thinking about pursuing a career with Invitation Homes: don't. Seriously. No amount of money would make this hell hole of a company tolerable. Although it's likely that they aren't offering you much money in the first place, which makes your decision that much easier. Walk away. Now. Every negative review that you read here is completely accurate, and the majority of the positive reviews are absolutely fake - commonly being published after another round of layoffs to combat the inevitable influx of negative reviews. I cannot even come close to overstating the toxicity of the environment here. Some of the rudest, most unprofessional and manipulative people that I have ever had the misfortune of working with have been put in positions of power. Any good morale that ever existed has been completely sucked out of the office - teamwork and collaboration are nonexistent as this company has been reduced to an ""every man for himself"" environment. Be prepared to play the blame game and to have fingers pointed at you, because this environment is non-conducive to actual problem solving. Rather, most find that their time is better spent passive-aggressively CC'ing upper management on trivial issues and passing the buck on to someone else in order to avoid having to do any actual work. Don't be surprised if you are forbidden from interacting with other departments. Don't be surprised if you go years without a performance review or a raise. Don't be surprised if management starts rumors about you and accuses you of wrongdoing without having any basis whatsoever. And then doubles down on accusations even after you've provided irrefutable proof against them. Corporate HR has completely abandoned the Bellevue branch because it's too far gone. There is no saving this branch unless they decide to address the actual problems and start cleaning house to get rid of the negativity. I've spelled out the problem for you here. If you decide to continue down the road with IH, you won't get any sympathy from me when it all hits the fan. If you value your dignity, your time, and your sanity you should stay far, far away from Invitation Homes.",Invitation Homes,INVH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Invitation-Homes-Reviews-E666277.htm
CORRUPT,1.0,"Mar 26, 2016",I was employed in the Chicago market for about 3 years in a secondary management position and met some of the hardest working people I have ever met.The Work place is fast paced and could be a great place to learn the ins and outs of the single family home rental industry.,"The local management team is inept and corrupt. I quickly found out that if you are not a (YES MAN) Your in for a miserable workplace environment with the full intention of having you resign or be terminated by whatever means necessary, including but not limited to false accusations and being written up for them, micromanaged to the point of making it impossible to make good business decisions, adding more work than can be effectively handled without working many hours after work. I found that the local management team to be highly inefficient and held themselves to a different standard including corporate policy. It is unfortunate that the corporate management team doesn't adhere to their own bylaws and policies as the way they want to conduct business, it is the wild west in the Chicago market and nobody seems to care, anything goes and I mean anything as long as you don't have an opinion. The sad reality is so many of the charter employee's of this start up company that showed a great work ethic and took it personally to make this company productive have left for many reasons, including less money and in many cases without another job lined up. I chose to resign for the reasons I listed above, take a look at all the other entries to this web site and related web sites before making a decision to work at this company. I would recommend this company to NOBODY!!!",Invitation Homes,INVH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Invitation-Homes-Reviews-E666277.htm
Worst company I've ever worked for,1.0,"Oct 9, 2014","Pay, when hired, I thought was great until it became evident that working 60+ hours a week was the rule, not exemption. When actual hours worked are taken to account, pay equates to hardly above minimum wage. Benefits and 401K good though. Only other positive was that all of the employees there dislike the company and atmosphere so much it gave us instant bonding.","This review could easily turn in to a novel, so I will try to keep it brief while also warning of the negative experience this company provides. Having worked in a start up atmosphere previously, I was prepared for some chaos and whirlwind of processes, procedures, changes, etc. However, the number of changes and rules happened at a much higher rate than any start up I've worked at prior. Then, once a change is implemented from Corporate, it may take weeks or months for it to be communicated to the Region, and only is communicated once an employee unknowingly disobeys the new rule/process and is reprimanded for it, that it is then passed along as the correct protocol. Furthermore, each department within the Region runs almost as if it is a separate company, with a blame game and finger pointing culture rather than a unified front working together for a common goal. In addition, as another reviewer posted, socializing with employees of other departments is discouraged, which surely impacts the departments working as individuals rather than a whole. I certainly don't want to come off as a disgruntled employee, and in fact, just the opposite. I've had amazing experiences at other companies. I'm an intelligent, hard working, self motivated employee, and I don't believe it's too much to appreciate recognition for these traits. Invitation Homes did not, and will not, recognize their employees for the value they have, and instead, thinks you are ""lucky"" to have a job with them. I hope this review was helpful, as it is truly a fair and accurate assessment of not just one, but many employees of this company.",Invitation Homes,INVH,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Invitation-Homes-Reviews-E666277.htm

Another Wall Street experiment ready to go bust!,1.0,"Jan 25, 2016",Ever see the movie office space? This is it in real life. Worked from field supervisor up to RTM Director in less than a year.

Great benefits and if your smart you get away early every Friday so you have time off.,The HR department is a joke. They actually have subordinates spy and report on the management. Your management team will be replaced every year or at max 18 months. This is due to failure of company leaders to hit goals. You will be blamed and out the door you go. I left and within 6 months new regional President was fired. Told him the day I left he would never make it. The lack of professionalism in the office is the down fall. The new resource manager has family working on IH homes and previous employee has all the cleaning. This is against the rules but there is no management anymore. If you are in management never try to help a subordinate especially if opposite sex as you will be bought in by HR and accused of sexual misgivings. The whole issue with IH is the leasing department from the President all the way down still blames Rehab Dept. for their failure to keep units occupied and stay at 70%.

RSVP NO to this Invitation,1.0,"Jan 16, 2016",There are some good people that work at the entry level.,"I have worked in the corporate workplace for a good amount of time and multiple different companies. This company by far was my worst experience. The only thing that matters to them is what they can do to make the most money and the only people they care about are upper management. They don't care about good customer service or a quality product. They only care about going public and letting the upper management get rich from that. I was with the company from the beginning. I worked very hard, long hours and brought several great ideas to the table. My ideas were taken by management and used as their own. My hard work and long hours were taken for granite and I was demoted shortly after receiving a promotion. They will fire an employee if they mess up on their time card by a minute but management can have an inappropriate relationship with someone they directly supervise (against company policy) and it doesn't matter. An hourly employee is required to take PTO if they have to leave 15 minutes early but management can take multiple days off and not take any PTO. Upper management will throw anyone under the bus to save their own jobs. They make terrible business decisions such firing almost half the staff because they stopped buying homes and once those employees were gone, they decide to start buying homes again giving all current employees twice as much of a work load. I am a very happy, easy going person who loves life. This company made me a nervous, angry, bitter person who hated going to work. I kept thinking that it was a start up and things would eventually get better. However, in all the years, it only got worse. If you have a good work ethic and care about your job, then I would stay far away from this place. In my opinion, the good reviews were probably people that were paid off. I have never met anyone that worked for Invitation Homes and enjoyed their job.
