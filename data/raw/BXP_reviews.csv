Staff, leadership and culture were better than average in the Prudential Tower office.","Your growth at BXP is very dependent on office politics, and in many cases I found leadership neglecting many talented individuals who wanted to grow internally, likely just because they weren't friendly enough with the right people. Likewise, it is not uncommon for some departments to treat their entry-level staff with little respect, so be prepared to develop some thick skin. Leadership in some regions barely lead at all, and prefer to gossip amongst themselves rather than address any problems they have with their colleagues. While it is certainly is your own responsibility to show drive, ambition and commitment in your role, I found it a rarity for leadership to bring those attributes out of entry-level staff. As for pay and bonuses, don't expect much drastic change unless you somehow will yourself into a leadership role. While the base pay is decent, bonuses and raises for entry-level positions are frustratingly low, and are not competitive compared to other positions in this field.",BXP,BXP,Office,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/BXP-Reviews-E3948.htm

I considered this job my ""unicorn"" - rare and may never be found again.","My position required me to be able to wear many hats, this isn't a complaint, the complaint of this is that other managers from other offices felt like they had control over my duties as well (marketing mostly, from the San Francisco office)and it caused a polite tug of war between them and my supervisor.

Company is not what is used too,2.0,"Mar 26, 2024","- Free lunches.

Gosh, this place does not pay competitively. I worked over 10+ years, Specifically under the property management area, the bloodline on daily activities. I saw employees from all positions come and go. The company is not what is used too, The reason I stayed so long was because of the work life balance I had and certain type of people I worked along were wonderful. I remember those days when you use to sit down at the Class A restaurants with managers to enjoy lunch on a quarterly basis. Now? order pizza and eat it at the conference room. Upper management promotes based on ""likeness"" and not on quality or experience. A lot of upper management credentials are lower than the newly hired personnel (shh! you don't know that). Great people slowly leaving, company founders slowly retiring, a new era is coming. There is rivalry within management and not a team environment. There is rivalry because the meat is too small, There is no room for advancement. Pay is not equal. The only way to stay alive is to mingle with the right management, A.K.A corporate game. If you are here for advancement, or to learn, this is not the place, if you want to retire or play corporate game, apply. The reason the company remains somewhat competitive, is because of the few original people are still onboard, executive management is what does the heavy lifting and their core buildings in prime locations.",BXP,BXP,Office,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/BXP-Reviews-E3948.htm

No cool-aid to drink, everybody has a family they love and want to get home to. This is work as work.

The following week she asked me, ""Why are you so miserable?"" and implied that my attitude was a problem. After a series of similar comments where this person made me feel subhuman, I brought my concerns to HR, where I felt that I was not being heard and my concerns were dismissed as being a miscommunication.

IS department is very toxic,1.0,"Apr 14, 2018",- Buildings are the best in class - Office closes at 3 pm on Summer Fridays - Decent medical/dental insurance although wageworks FSA is the worst part. - Monthly commuter contribution to employee - Good 401k,"IT Department is very toxic environment. There are a lot of issues with IS Management. The IT department has a top/down mentality and this mentality comes from the very top management in IS. This mentality of the management prohibits growth and it is not collaborative. If someone offer an alternative, that idea will not be welcomed. The IS environment is infectious and is driven by IS leadership. In my view the networking team and the help desk teams do not work well together and it has a trickle down effect that negatively impacts the department. The leadership in network services are actually engineers promoted as managers. In fact they shouldn’t have been promoted as managers as they are not very people oriented. They lack managerial qualities. All the important technical work would be actually done by them and only irrelevant and not much visible projects would be given to the Engineers. They travel around to other regions under the disguise of work and spent time in conferences like RSA, EMCWorld and VMworld and do not give the engineers the opportunity to go either of these events or to these regions. The IS leadership has major trust issues and would not give work to anyone they do not trust. There is no training provided by the company and they expect you to complete projects with technology that no one has any idea. Also Boston Properties does not allow work from home even on inclement weather conditions. Also they pay is not good. No paternity leaves and maternity leave is just outdated. The company is very much old school. Its very much a 60’s environment. Also the HR department does not work for employees rather on behalf of executives.

Management and other coworkers watched when I came in, what I did at my desk, when and how many times I looked at my cell phone, how many times I went to use the bathroom, when I went to lunch, what I ate for lunch and when I left to go home. If you came in 5-8 minutes late, you were warned and then written up. You had a strict schedule of 8-5 and if you decided you wanted to work a different schedule such as work 7:30-4:30 or 8-5 with an hour lunch or 7:30-4:00 or 8:00-4:30 or 8:30-5:00 and take a 30 minute lunch, it wasn't allowed and you got written up if you changed your time. Very strict dress code even for a place where you never met with the tenants or clients! If you needed to go to a doctor's appointment, you had to use a sick day. Of course if you were new, you don't have any sick days for 90 days but yet you are forced to pay for benefits that you cannot use. Don't micromanage your employees so much. Have you noticed you have a high turn over for your support staff? Pay is lower than the market rate.
