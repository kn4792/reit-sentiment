Poor upper management,3.0,"Oct 17, 2025","Stable hours, housing, sundays off","Poor upper management, severely understaffed to where I was running 3 sites (over 1200 units) for 6 months with driving between all 3 sites and competing all the daily operation's and only receiving 1$ pay increase stipend. Ran 2 sites for over 2 years (one owned one managed ) saving them over 100k a year and they offered me a dollar raise confirming that they still get paid that money. They just didn’t want to compensate their teammates for it. Upper management from san Diego lies, constant victim mentality. Attacks people verbally by blaming them for everything, then lies to her boss to get people fired. Worked there for 3 years with great reviews and raises and was even offered another site because “they needed someone with the experience I have to handle the volume of units and customers that location has” not 2 months later I was fired.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

Scheduling can be inconsistent with low staff, and traveling to other stores for shifts or to assist others is common. Leadership was fewer than 5 people who worked from home/separate offices and were typically difficult to contact quickly, making connections with other local store managers crucial. Leadership often made decisions without key holder input and did not communicate changes effectively, leading to even further issues. Little opportunity for growth within the company, with two arguably ceremonial promotions of General Manager and Senior Manager being given to those who stick around for a few years with little pay or responsibility changes, and Field Training Specialist which is a parallel title to all Manager positions.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

Weekly district meetings keep everyone on the same page, and provide a sense of cohesion and further team accomplishments. The District Manager for my location is one of the best retail managers I have ever encountered. She was a true captain, in that she could do every job that she oversaw. This company could run workshops on how to run a large business. Everything is streamlined, there is an answer to every question, and nothing falls between the cracks. CubeSmart runs a tight ship.","There is only one con I can think of: CubeSmart may not own the storage property that you work at, they may just manage it.

Don't Bother With CubeSmart,2.0,"Oct 22, 2024",-Great for multi tasking stuff not related to work -Not a super complicated job -Can go a whole day with no customers in the office,"-Not transparent in anything that could affect customers such as rate increases for a unit. -Raises do not cover the raise in cost of living (normally a 2% raise once a year and that's if you score high enough on the review). -If you take on another title (senior manager/trainer) you do not get a raise for that or a larger raise when the yearly review comes up. -Currently trying to single staff all facilities and then have some of us 'remote' work another store with no increase in pay for that. -You can get the same training mods multiple times a month or year (we've had the 'Slips/Trips/Falls' mod I think once a month every month with a few times it happening TWICE in a month). -Not as environmentally friendly as they claim. We are required to use one time plastic ties to secure units because they cost pennies versus the locks we had been using that we could reuse for customers. -If you are given Spotlight points for a job well done, you are taxed extra on that so be prepared to have a lower paycheck if you use the Spotlight points. -District managers can and will show favoritism towards employees and customers (white men have a better chance of having their way. If you aren't a white male be prepared to be screwed over). -If the shareholders aren't happy it will 100% affect how you do your job. Normally making it much more complicated. -Have an idea that might make the job easier? Be prepared to be told no it will not happen, have the thread closed and months later a favorite employee will say the same thing and it will go through. Ideas will be told no with no explanation. -If you waive a late fee or give a credit to a customer be prepared to be told not to do it again even though a customer can have up to two fee waives a year and up to 12 $25 credits a year. -The call center is a joke most times. No notes on reservations or leads and they like to make 24 hours holds into reservations that will affect your conversion.

Would not recommend,1.0,"Sep 8, 2024",Some of the customers you meet while working there,"My health quickly declined after starting with this company. My blood pressure was running sky high, I was under constant stress and some days didn't get lunch AND left an hour late to get everything done that was asked on their checklists when higher ups would come though. You are maintenance, management, therapist, collections, customer service and much more working for this company. They definitely show favoritism and allow their favorites to do whatever they want with no repercussions. My area FTS and her husband worked at separate stores and got their daughter hired as my SM. I did not find out until they called to tell me she was coming for her tour that she was related to my FTS and her husband. The daughter continuously tried to micromanage me with her parents assistance. They changed my schedule without asking on several occasions. They were always on their phones and did minimum to help on the property. The husband would do food delivery on the clock and sit at the desk with his feet up vaping and spying on other stores though the security cameras. They would use their cell phones to pull up cameras at other locations and spy on employees. They also used their phones to clock in and out without even being at work. They would be at Walmart or getting breakfast and clock in on their phones and get to work late. I was told it was immediate termination for signing in to company portal from personal devices. They did not care about your physical health and you constantly had them asking more of you and no extra help. I was terminated and they are fighting my unemployment benefits. Upper management especially the DM lied and said I voluntarily resigned. If you want a job where you are constantly stressed and running around this is it.

Horrible customers at some locations, including violence or threats of violence, but we do not have the authority to terminate rentals. Our safety is clearly not important.

Those same employees are not required to perform tasks to standard, creating more work for the others (the ones that are still trying, that is. A lot of us are just doing the minimum now). Company touts their customer service awards, but the truth is, these awards are because employees are harassed constantly to leave these reviews. There is an ""engagement"" survey every year. It asks the wrong questions, and the same things are given low scores every year. This demonstrates the culture of promising but not delivering. Lies, in other words. Mission statement includes: ""simplify the challenges their customers face through innovative solutions, unparalleled service, and genuine care."" I am certain that NO customers will agree that ""Unparalleled service and genuine care"" include 60-75% rate increases, cameras that have not worked in several years, mold growing on walls, and offices that are closed unexpectedly for a week at a time, due to corporate refusal to adequately staff the stores. The hypocrisy blows the mind. It's all about numbers. People do not matter. at. all. Employees are shamed publicly and penalized, if their numbers don't meet a certain standard. Customer base, location, and circumstances do not matter at all. Being shamed publicly is an example of the corporate toxicity-upper management visited stores recently and made personal remarks about an employee's appearance that were designed to humiliate and degrade. There is a ridiculous checklist required for reservations. It's useless, a time-water, waste of paper and toner, and clutters our workspace. Can we get rid of it? No, because it is the idea of some ...... individual...... in upper management, with no regard for how the stores work. The company recently put all the healthcare benefits into same website as payroll, which initially seemed a good idea. I am alarmed that all my passwords were saved and if I click on the external websites from within the internal website, my account is automatically opened.

Go Somewhere Else,1.0,"Mar 29, 2023",Out of fairness I tried to think of pros to the job but everything I could think of really wasn't. I did enjoy working with my customers other than when corporate was creating headaches for them and me.,"I know no job is perfect but this company took it to a new level from beginning to end. They are as deceptive to the employees as they are to the customers and they want you exercise that deception too. For some reason they can't hire anyone so you are usually running the facility by yourself and expected to stay on top of it as if you had the amount of people that should be there to cover it. They can find people to hire when they have to. I was amazed at how quick they found someone after I put in my two weeks notice even after getting told for years that no one wants to work. It makes me think it just saved them money paying one person to do the job instead of two. No they would never do that. I lost a lot of hours vacation last year do to the fact that they could not find anyone to hire and not so much as an apology for it. I lost all of the vacation time that I built up before putting in my two weeks notice because they claim my notice was only for 12 calendar days and not 14. I don't think I did but it is possible, however I would have not had that many days built up had there been proper coverage to use it. In fact loosing all of the hours last year is one of the reasons I decided find employment elsewhere. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else.

Certain departments are completely over-staffed and promotions are/were given to individuals that may not necessarily been the right choice and demotions occurred that were clearly the wrong choice. People are fearful to speak up and those that do speak up are viewed as negative and the problem. I find it humorous that so many people can be negative and their complaints are swept under the carpet. I personally have spoken up and was made to feel that what I said did make any difference and at that point I realized that we work for a company and a team of executives that only care about themselves. Certain executives can sit across from you and act like they care and are supportive, however as soon as your back is turned its game over and you are now a moving target with one foot out the door.

Terrible Leadership,1.0,"Apr 30, 2015",Nice corporate office but that is it.,"Senior Management dosn't provide any direction. It got better for a little while when we had a focused VP of HR but she left after less than 2 years. I can only imagine it was due to the frat boy mentality at the top. Now there are no women executives. The men in charge don't talk to anyone other than their direct male reports. They even appear to have banned employees from viewing the reviews on this site instead of addressing the issues of age, race and sex discrimination. The people that are next in line for promotion are white men that do not even try to fit in with the values and culture so that is a joke. Most departments are falling apart and more and more people are leaving. Workers are treated badly and resources are spent on executives and useless programs. You can't even trust that anyone at top will be discreet. You can overhear them talking badly about other employees which doesn't help morale. They won't take responsibility for anything. It is like there is no leadership and we are all just doing whatever we think is important. Morale is at an all time low. This was a great company to work for. Now the only thing that matters is saving money by giving 1.3% raises to everyone but the executives. Take a look at the proxy.

They are always throwing events and parties for their employees, so it's a nice and welcome distraction.","I would have preferred less parties and better wages. In my time at CubeSmart, it seemed as though the wages (rates, bonuses, raises) for hourly and regular, salaried employees were minuscule in comparison to the amount of money being spent on hiring director after director after director or awarding even more promotions to management. I believe one department had 7 directors, 2 managers, and 5 - 10 regular employees, and this seemed to be the trend throughout all of the departments. Hardly any promotion from within, and certainly not to females.

Tired Of Being Verbally Abused,1.0,"Feb 14, 2015",Opportunities to help customers in need of storage.,"Working for a Manager that manages by threats of termination, threats of retaliation unless ""doing as he says"", verbal abuse, screaming when talking either face to face or on the phone. Verbal abuse to the extent that employees are so stressed that it affects their health, home life and desire to even go to work is beyond shameful. Some extremely talented individuals have been either terminated or driven to resigning for unsubstantiated reasons. When a Management has the ""power/authority"" to end someone's employment based on things like keeping payroll below budget due to experienced employees salaries being above what thry could pay someone with less experience, there is a problem. Seems like Management can ""trump up"" instances/reasons for termination or documenting instances based on taking things ""out of context"". running.

I figured, after the higher taxes on bonus I might see $150, but that's still a nice bonus for doing what I see as my job. In reality, the company gave me a $407 bonus, so that after taxes I received the full $250. They didn't have to do that, I wasn't expecting anything like that, but they did it anyway.

The culture is very welcoming; any teammate company wide is willing to help you as needed. The district manager, divisional vice president, and corporate are always helpful and friendly. I'd say the hardest part of the job is cleaning cubes outside when it gets above 90 degrees but you do have time for breaks as needed. The most enjoyable part of working here is being on your own basically, you are running a store and property with one other person usually, sometimes 2, and as long as you do what needs done you are trusted to keep the store running.

Changes are made and not communicated, and everyone is just supposed to know. Not all employees are treated the same. Some people can be chronically late, spend the day chatting on cell phones, or doing their nails and are paid more(!) than someone who is dedicated, punctual, and spends the day cleaning, renting, fielding complaints, and making collection calls. Some employees can be constantly rude to customers and coworkers alike, even calling people offensive names, with no fear of reprisal. Complaints about this do little good (except to be called a negative person), as this company seems afraid to address personnel issues in a timely manner. There is constant mention of how well the company is doing, and how profitable each year is, but the field workers see very little of this money. Maintenance on properties takes begging and pleading and employees who already have enough to do are required to clean gutters, fill potholes,repair golf carts, change light fixtures, plumbing, and other things that should be hired out , bonuses are practically nonexistent, and pay raises are microscopic. The extreme rate increases in the past two years have caused major complaints from long term customers, as they don't see any of the money going back into properties.

"Nice people but not a well-run company, and low pay",3.0,"May 18, 2022","Everyone I worked with at CubeSmart was very nice, intelligent and hard working. Even the senior leadership were nice and approachable. The culture pre-Covid was unique and fun, almost like a tech start-up kind of feel...without the 70 hour work weeks, though it definitely has suffered post-pandemic. Health and retirement benefits are about average with a decent but antiquated PTO policy, though that's been improved over the years through more attention and empowerment of Human Resources. Advancement from within is possible, though with some caveats. The self-storage industry is resilient and seems to do well regardless of macroeconomic factors, and CubeSmart benefiits from this. The senior leaders run the company well from a financial management perspective. Diversity and inclusion are good and have improved dramatically over the years. It's overall a good place to work, especially to start a career, but not without some really ugly warts.","The company grew very rapidly over the last 10 years, and the senior leaders are a mainly the same people that ran it 10 years ago. That continuity is nice but I'm not sure those leaders, and the many second level leaders who were promoted, are all capable of handling of running a much larger company. They still micromanage everything like they did when the company was small. There's very little high level strategic leadership. Their success has led to a certain level of arrogance, making them blind or indifferent to problems certain problems. They could definitely benefit from some new blood from outside the industry in senior leadership. The systems needed to keep pace are insufficient because they try to do everything in house without enough money, people or resources needed to support that. Pay below the executive level is uncompetitive, leading to being short staffed across the company, from the stores, to the call center, to IT, and most other departments to some degree as well. This had led to burnout among good people who are working hard for substandard pay, so they're leaving in droves. Meanwhile the senior execs are paid extraordinarily well and seem either unwilling to admit fault, or just don't see it. Not sure which it is, nor which is worse. Dissent is not tolerated. There's some politics like anywhere, but favorites definitely tend to get promoted beyond their capabilities. All this has led to a feeling that leadership either just doesn't know what they're doing, or maybe they do but they just don't care despite their lip-service to culture and genuine care. In the end, we all know it's about dollars, but leadership and longterm success are enhanced by doing more than just capably managing the finances quarter to quarter.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

It is what you make it,4.0,"Jun 18, 2017","I am going to try not to be biased because I am a trainer for this company, but there are a lot of great reasons to work for CubeSmart. This company is customer service. The company reputation and rapid growth are the main results for great customer service. You get to meet lots of new people, build long lasting relationships with co workers and customers, you get the benefit of working in an office and outside on property, because of the rapid growth the opportunity to climb the ladder is there, and there is always ways to make extra money based on your performance.

Manager,4.0,"Aug 12, 2015","The manager's job is relatively simple; accept payments, lease units, keep the property clean, and help with accounts receivable. That's the bulk of the job. Your volume of foot traffic can vary heavily depending upon the location of your property and the season (summer being the big rental season). This job was great for me while I was in junior college taking night classes, as my General Manager allowed me to keep my books under the desk and study/do homework whenever we had down-time (which during the winter was very often) and all of our daily tasks were finished.","First, I would like to mention that I actually think this is a great job for younger people who are perhaps still in school and want to be able to put the title of Manager on a resume later in life. However, I will provide as much detail as possible on the Cons that I can easily think of just to provide you with as clear of a picture of the job's drawbacks as possible. Most of these were not significant enough to me personally to matter, but you should be aware of them so that you can judge for yourself how well you may fit in this position. I just don't want someone to see my long list of cons and think that it means the job is terrible or that I am trashing the company. I just like to be specific and thorough. Most properties have video cameras in the offices which are linked up to a DVR which your Area and District Managers can access freely. If you have a good DM and you are a good employee, then this is likely not going to be an issue for you. But, for those of you who may have a less than friendly DM, or who are generally uncomfortable with the possibility of being watched/recorded, then this may be an issue for you. Of course, customers can also be a source of stress, and any job in which you work with the public shares this hassle. Your experience in this position will vary heavily depending upon your General Manager (basically your immediate boss at your property, and likely the only other coworker you regularly see unless you cover other properties very often) and your District/Area Managers (which one of these two you interact with depends upon your district and company climate at the time. When I started, there was an area manager, then the position was eliminated and the area manager went back to being a normal GM, then a few years later another person was promoted to AM, and by the time I left there was talk of promoting a second AM). Managers have little control over how your accounts receivable and liens are handled, which are a big component of how your bonus is calculated. This means that if your GM decides to give a tenant an extra month to pay their past-due rent, or makes a mistake in their lien paperwork, or a variety of other situations, then you will lose a large portion of your bonus for that month(possibly quarter, I forget how often the bonuses were paid out) because your accounts receivable are too high. For that matter, the AR goals of all properties are calculated as a percentage of the property's total income, which is perfectly fine for most locations, but certain properties which are in worse neighborhoods will have consistently higher ARs and little hope of lowering them, and thus will not make much bonus money. Also, while your GM will be giving you an annual performance review, you do not get the opportunity to review your GM unless you deliberately complain to your AM or DM, which can cause you problems in a smaller office setting. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of room for advancement from this starting point in the company. It is rare that there is an opening for a new GM, and in such a case you should reach out to your DM and let them know if you are interested in the position (they typically will not think to ask Managers if they would be interested in the position unless the vacancy is at their home location). In a district that may have anywhere from 10 to 30 locations, there is normally only 1 or 2 area managers (and if I recall correctly, this position may require some college coursework or an associate's degree, but if interested, you should double check) and therefore even more rarely a chance to be promoted to this position. Promotion to DM is, in my experience, something like spotting a shooting star. You know that it happens, and you probably have friends who have seen it happen, but its not the sort of thing that's common. For one, being a DM requires a bachelors degree (at least it did when I worked there, so you many want to double check), and surprisingly few GMs or AMs have one of these. Also, it is more often the case that the properties in your district will simply be reassigned to another DM when a sudden vacancy in the position occurs (this happened when my DM sadly passed away). So, it would be hard for you to move into a DM position unless you knew that your current DM would be leaving, or that the company is looking to expand and create a new DM position, and you are willing to relocate for this purpose.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

Corporate wants to provide the sites customers with a WOW experience to keep them coming back for more, if they need storage again in the future. Millions of dollars have been pumped into this program when, in my advice, this is not the way to go. You could argue the fact that they have won awards and this is because of the WOW program they have in place. I would say no though because when its time for awards to come around, they constantly spam store emails telling you to vote for the company and to tell friends to vote for them. If it was because of the WOW service everyone received, should we have to vote for ourselves every year, I think not. Someone on here said it best when they said ""10-12 dollars is going to get you 10-12 dollars worth of service"". The ""you get what you pay for"" applies here when it comes to people. Instead of pumping millions into creating a ""culture"" that everyone is supposed to follow and live out, pump those millions into recruiting and existing employees. Can we train our district managers to go out and look for talent instead of spoon feeding us a program that will only work if the person is willing to accept it? Find the right person in the first place and you don't have to worry about instilling VALUES and MISSION STATEMENTS and DEFINITION OF WOW! *according to CubeSmart* down everyones throats. Let's talk about rasies for a second, what a joke! If you have had an EXCEPTIONALLY well year, don't expect to get rewarded for it. The most people get is around 25 cents. If you get higher than that, your district manager has to take away from someone else to give to the other person. This is how it was explained to me by a former district manager. The company gives 2-3 percent, AT MOST 3 IF THEY HAD A GOOD YEAR, to give to the district manager to give to ALL employees in district. Talk about pathetic, take a look at the companies publicly traded symbol over the last few years, I'd say that the company has been doing pretty well yes? Year over year the company continues to grow and is trying to gain traction in the storage world. They do so because the people running the stores are doing something right but yet where is the reward?

Depending who is the District Manager the job may be okay for most people with the high standards it can be too much but it's manageable.,"A lot of gossip takes place in the workplace. It can be difficult to take vacation sometimes if coverage is not available for the store. If you have a District Manager that is all business and does not get to know you it can kill moral as they become judgemental by what others say about you. There can be a lot of knit picking when it comes to doing your job. For example, yes you may do a lot of things right but you didnt do this. The focus from the company feels like 25 percent focus of what you did right and 75 percent focus on what you did wrong. Company depends on mystery shops sometimes too much and although you may be freat at your job one slip up put you in that negative light of how you work. Pay is ok compared to other retail jobs but for a company to preach that they was everyone to have a career they need to increase wages. Word of advice if you want to raise a family, this job will not do. Career jobs pay around $20hr. You cant get to that point especially after they consolidated positions unless you work for corporate headquarters. Company try to bring in a positive culture to the company but ultimately feel it is a waste since the amount of work you do does not equal the same amount of money. Working outside on a hot day and putting up with attitudes to make you feel like an emotional punching bag does not equal the starting pay they offer you.

You work outside not matter what to clean an entire property which includes landscaping and then you have to deal with people that are pissed at you, pissed at the world, or mad because you had to close the office for 10 minutes to clean outside.

District Managers often push off their responsibilities to General Managers and Senior GMs, especially when it comes to teammate discipline which is something only DMs are supposed to do. District Managers very rarely follow through on anything, and firing terrible employees just doesn't happen - they would prefer you just quit. CEO is full of it. Every year the store employee bonus program is restructured and our bonus pools get smaller. Pay is terrible for the work performed. Upward movement is non-existent anymore. Lots of hiring from Public Storage now, which is known for low-quality candidates, and the work culture is adjusting accordingly. Managers and District Managers who come from Public Storage often ""don't get it"" and try to do things the PS way - which is counter to CubeSmart's mission and values. Often times when DMs come from PS they bring in their own PS people and create a clique - if you aren't from PS you don't get recognition and are overlooked for opportunities in these districts. WOW! culture seems to only apply at the store level and from store employees to customers. Corporate employees and district managers do not engage in culture when dealing with store employees. You are talked down to a lot by fellow employees at corporate. This started occurring after Chris Marr took over, which shows it is likely an issue stemming from the top. Hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. People get upset for the strangest reasons and they often are not justified. It takes a lot of energy to deal with, but over time you grow accustomed and know how to deliver that WOW service.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm
HQ - A mixed opportunity.,2.0,"Sep 4, 2018","Beautiful HQ with a comfortable environment, plenty of work space, in-house gym, spaces in which to socialize and have informal conversations with co-workers aka teammates and plenty of office related activities to build team-work. The provided fruit and gas grills available all four seasons were nice amenities. The CEO and management team were accessible for professional networking or to simply chat should the opportunity present itself -- that's invaluable and a true benefit to working in the company and HQ. Most teammates were approachable and friendly. In general, there was a will to solve problems and collaborate as needed and time allowed.","The organization's rate of growth over the past few years severely stressed existing personnel. While the growth should be applauded, it came at a significant cost to human resources. Some departments hired more staff to handle their respective workloads while others did not. The disparity in staffing levels and workloads impacted managers and staff alike with uneven opportunities for [formal and informal] professional development, nearly unavailable middle management who seemed to be buried in one project or another, varying levels of individual burnout and curtailed networking opportunities being examples. It was truly hellacious. Project management skill sets across the organization were not readily apparent. The lack of applied standard PM practices critically harmed company initiatives with long-term impact on both HQ and retail teammates. In some cases, the project resources assigned to task execution were stretched beyond any reasonable expectation given existing workloads and rates of compensation. This made for some jaw dropping scenarios. For job candidates, it will be important to understand the workload (easily quantifiable in the context of CubeSmart), available staffing and potential professional opportunities prior to accepting a position. Asking the hard questions up front and making sure that the financial ask is inline with the presented work conditions will set up the candidate for a decent experience in the organization. It is possible to find a really good work group in the company. Benefits were OK, but not amazing. Due diligence with compensation and benefits offered v. workload and defined professional opportunities for growth is a must!",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm
"Cubesmart is not ""Heart Full"", but heartless",2.0,"Jun 18, 2019","Steady work, friendly co-workers, and some great district managers.","The ""royalty/peasant"" mentality with the upper echelon of Cubesmart, being anyone above the district managers. My Divisional Vice President and his administrative assistant looked down their noses at the facility employees, treating them like chattle. Three examples: 1) When Cubesmart was planning to purchase my old site, the DVP and his adminstrative assistant came to visit the site. The Admin Asst asked me what I usually do for lunch. I told her that on my way from the bank deposit, I stop at the Burger at the corner of our street and pick up my lunch on the way back. In a haughty voice she said, ""Well, we're going to put a stop to THAT!"" meaning that I shouldn't get my lunch on business time. 2) When I was asked by the DVP what my hourly rate was, he said ""OK, good"" and left it to my very personable District Manager to tell me that since I was making more than any other manager in the area, that my salary would be cut by 75 cents an hour, in case any other managers were to find out what I was making. I told him that I earned that money over the years, and he shrugged his shoulders and said sorry. 3) Working on Sundays was mandatory for Assistant Manager, and instead of making the business hours employee friendly ( like 9 am to 1 pm) the store hours are 11-3, pretty much ruining any effort to have some family time on Sunday.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

"Can be great for some, terrible for others",3.0,"Jul 23, 2014","CubeSmart is a great place to work for if you enjoy working independently, being in a laid back environment, sales and marketing, and are at a point in your life where you're not really looking to move up but are just looking for stability. As a GM you manage a facility with typically only one other employee. Many times you and the manager will not work at the same time as it is not often busy enough for the need of two employees. If you enjoy working alone this can be great, if not then this might not be the position for you.","Many times the maintenance responsibilities are performed by the GM and Manager which can be a bit strenuous at times. Regular cleaning and maintenance includes sweeping, dusting, mopping, landscaping, cutting the grass, leaf blowing, and in some cases even cleaning the gutters on the storage units. Facilities with one large building that houses indoor units are typically easier to maintain than facilities with several buildings and indoor and outdoor storage. The primary drawback to this position is that there are not many opportunities to move up. It's not hard to move from manager to GM if the position comes available but being a general manager is about as high up as many will get. While they have Area Managers and District Managers the positions do not come available very often and they take into accountability years with the company. At the time I lived on site which was a nice bonus but the two bedroom apartments are very small at times and you have zero privacy. It's not uncommon to have customers come to your door in the middle of the night because they lost their key, forgot their gate code, or need to make a payment.",CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm

If you are a student do NOT work for this company,2.0,"Aug 26, 2015",Honestly there weren't too many pros of working for this company. I really don't even think I have a whole lot to say about the good things.,"Management favoritism- My first actual week at my store, the man that hired me (DM) was fired. So then another DM was going to be in charge of our store. I met the man in person once. I had one GM when I started who I LOVED and she got pushed out to bring another GM in. The GM that was hired to take her place had not worked for this company before and was hired in as GM even though there were plenty of store managers in the area who were way more qualified for the position. This GM had the DM wrapped around her little finger. Anything she wanted she got. Not a flexible schedule- Going into this job I did not know that I would be starting school again. So when I found out what my school schedule was going to be I notified my DM right away. It took a couple days to hear back from him but even then I didn't hear back. He called my GM to have her tell me that it would not be possible for them to work with me on my schedule. All I was asking was to leave 30 minutes early everyday so that I could make it to class on time. He didn't even have the nerve to tell me himself. He had someone else do it. That seemed to be the case on many occasions. Calling in sick- If you are sick, just go to work anyway. Calling in was the biggest hassle. You have to call your DM, then your AM, then your GM. I had strep throat and was told to stay in bed. But I tried calling in and my DM made it sound like it was the biggest hassle in the world. Even though my GM was also scheduled that day. Most days you really only need one person in the office.

You are expected to do the work of several people, expected to stay outside all day in dangerous heat and cold (unless you are privileged to work on all climate control). After working outside, sweating, getting filthy by cleaning human waste,cleaning gutters, coughing your lungs out while working in filth, trimming trees, and other ridiculous expectations, we are to present a clean, neat, professional appearance in office.

We are supposed to ""wow"" customers, but aren't given the authority to actually do anything if there is an issue. LOW, LOW, LOW pay, not enough to live on, while the jerk COO, CFO, CEO, etc get millions in bonus. Insurance plan they call protection plan is overpriced, yet we are penalized if customers prefer to use their own homeowners or renters. Seriously, this is a huge issue at some stores. Things do not get fixed. Cubesmart and owners of managed stores prefer to make cosmetic changes, rather than fixing huge issues, and of course, the employee at store is expected to deal with it and provide a positive experience to customers. No cameras? We are to lie about it. Gate not logging people? So what. Lie. One person working and a jerk leaves a ton of trash to clean up, including heavy old stuff?

Corporate Structure,3.0,"Nov 18, 2022",CubesSmart provides good training and tries to develop a sense of teamwork within it's divisions. That is not an easy task when each store functions rather independently.,The corporate structure with regard to pricing sometimes does not allow one store the ability to compete with other facilities when it comes to occupancy and meeting company set goals.,CubeSmart,CUBE,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CubeSmart-Self-Storage-Reviews-E429776.htm
Disappointed in the CEO and at the direction CubeSmart is going employee wise...,1.0,"Dec 19, 2015","A pro is the 401K match, however, most field employees don't make enough to take full advantage of it. Plus it's through TransAmerica, hefty ""maintenance"" fees are paid yearly. Example, I was able to put $300 for the year and the company matched with $200, I paid a ""maintenance fee"" if $135..... yeah, so saving for the little guy is hard to do. So I guess ultimately even the 401K is a Con....?","I Will preface this with CubeSmart has a HUGE employee turnover rate - people quitting, not getting fired. It's extremely hard to get fired. A lot of people from the Corporate office have left in the past few years too. So keep that in mind as you read this. Also know that CubeSMart is GOOD for a college student, a person who just needs just any job for the time being, it's also good for people who are getting close to retirement age and need to earn less to collect full social security. 1.) Cuts - Constantly looking for ways to take from the field employees. Most recent example, getting rid of the Area Manager position. ****UPDATE 12/23/15 - since you will be change from salary to hourly pay that will cause the checks to be short a weeks pay. Instead of getting paid for 2 weeks you will get paid for one since you will not be paid in real time anymore. So to help the employees out that will be getting a short check CubeSmart is allowing you to...... ready for this...? To apply any unused vacation time to make up for the short check. So, you can lose your vacation time to make up for a change the company made that caused your check to be short. Talk about WOWing! the employees. Now, we will get a new title of ""Senior Manager"" or whatever they call it and we will still have same responsibilities and doing the same work, but no more mileage and no more visiting other stores. Why is this important? Because when getting promoted to Area Manger they negotiate LOW PAY and say how ""since you will be getting mileage the pay will be lower"". So, some genius up in Corporate found another way to cut from the people who can least afford it instead of cutting the fat up in the Corporate office. 2.) Bonuses - So, every year the field employees get a $100 bonus. However, that $100 becomes roughly $75 after taxes lol. Also be careful with the ""WOW cards"", they tax those too. Before the current CEO got in we actually had a nice incentive bonus structure. We'd get a bonus for beating revenue, selling of merchandise, total square footage and accrued rent. My store would get $600 - $700/month in bonuses for hitting all our goals. Enter new generation CEO, now we are lucky to see $40/month... Again, kudos to Corporate for looking out for their employees. 3.) Moral - Here's a good way to know moral is at an all time high at the company, when field employees are asked to write 5 star reviews on GlassDoor. Back story on this is, we were at a district meeting and they started talking about company reviews. Well that eventually lead to employees reviewing the company on GlassDoor. As you can see the reviews aren't too favorable and I see exactly why they went to the lowest on the totem pole to write 5 star reviews. 4.) Pay - Again, CubeSmart is ALWAYS looking for ways to cut your pay. You transfer to a different state, no matter what state - pay cut. You live on site - pay cut. Your promotion and year review hit around the same time - you get screwed. ""Well we just gave you a raise for your promotion so your yearly raise is included in that"". 5.) Advancement - So lately CubeSmart started releasing weekly video called ""Teammate Spotlight"". The theme seems to be ""so and so is a PERFECT EXAMPLE of how you can advance in the company."". Sure people in corporate can advance at a faster pace than the field employees. In the field you RARELY get to advance unless you are in the right place at the right time OR a favorite. When you have a few GM's that have been in the position for 7, 10, 15 years... you know you can't advance too easy. Also, it's really easy to get stuck behind a GM that is clueless but CubeSmart will keep them in the position as long as the store is running without complaints from Customers. 6.) General Cons - Customer Service - While they have set hours the store is open, be expecting to work off the clock when you get that call from the call center about a Customer on property trying to move in after hours, or needs their lock cut because they lost their key. Think you can get a little overtime for your time spent WOWing the Customer? Think again, the company expects you to do it with a smile and if you punch in, they expect you to cut it later by taking a longer lunch or leaving early. If you DON'T punch in and gladly do it, they company thinks you are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Over Time - The company has a strict policy about no over time. Get that last minute Customer that comes in at 5:58PM to move in? Don' think staying late to give that outstanding Customer service will get you a little bonus over time. You are again, expected to cut it. The call center calls you at 9PM because a Customer was running late and just has to move in tonight? Go help them, WOW the Customer and then make sure you cut the over time. See the pattern here....? WOW the Customer but screw the employee. Favoritism - Seems like a lot of District Managers like yes men/women, If you are one of those or simply a brown noser, you WILL get special treatment. 7.) Health Care - Another joke.

Get back to basics,1.0,"Mar 4, 2015",401(k) Benefits Disability The employees that stick together and support one another.,"I personally have walked by the CEO numerous times in my career with CubeSmart and not once was I ever greeted by a hello first. We are all human and deserve to be treated with respect. Just because you make more money doesn't mean you have a right to treat us like we are beneath you. The company clearly is looking for men to be the leaders. The arrogance and cockiness of our executive team is overbearing. Women are treated like second-class citizens. The only one female senior executive is looked at as part of the boys club. I have personally seen executive raise their voices and be condescending to employees, all women, in front of others. If you are not one of the pegged favorites you are looked at as somebody that is replaceable as opposed to somebody that brings value to the company. It is quite obvious that females over the age of 40 is not what CubeSmart wants working for the company. There is such a lack of caring and compassion. Our CEO talks about family and work life balance and working together as a team but it's just talk. It's amazing that the executive team is out of the office before 5 o'clock most nights and starts their weekends early, but the teammates that are making the money for the company work late hours, work from home in order to complete their work. Work life balance, right? WRONG! There is gossiping and whispering among the executive team that is just as unprofessional and and one executive in particular has a habit of coercing certain teammates within the department to side with them regardless of the truth. Take time and read all of these comments there is a common theme.

Company claims to have ""paid holidays"" but store personnel are scheduled an extra day off to keep you from getting that small extra 8 hours on your check. DM's asking/doing questionable things. Like manually adjusting your time sheet so that you don't get unapproved overtime. Even if that was because a customer came in at 5:58pm and you stayed late to move them in.

Understand what you are getting into before you accept their offer.,1.0,"May 11, 2017","-Possible time to study depending on the store. -Somewhat flexible scheduling. -Simple work that requires little thought, other than trained repetition of certain systems and tasks. -Free bottled water. -Networking with customers","If you are a young person (20 - 30) it can be an ideal job while you are attending school. This is because at slower stores you'll likely be able to study on the job between taking care of administrative tasks and general maintenance. I would suggest visiting the store you may be working to gauge how busy it is. If it is a busy store, or in a bad area, then then you'll likely have no time to study. The reason I mention studying for younger employees is because this company caters to people who lack ambition, or are retired, and have no other ambition except to stay busy for 12 to 15 dollars an hour (maybe a little more depending on the area, but it may be less in other areas). CubeSmart is a somewhat ideal job while someone is making a transition in life, but given that there is few opportunities for advancement in position or pay I would label it a dead-end job. Yes, in some instances an employee may be offered residence on site (if an apartment exists), but it is not free of charge as some might believe. If an employee leases an apartment on site then more than likely that employee will be the emergency contact, and be required to take care of all the problems that occur after hours. In my experience all kinds of crazy, shady things, occur at night at storage facilities. Just ask anyone who has worked in the industry. Understand that if you are in a store manager position you will be required to clean the entire facility, spray for weeds, general maintenance, handle auctions, retail operations, collection calls, ect., often times by yourself. Be aware that you will be receiving commission for rentals, and the current bonus system may only yield you 100 dollars a month or less. If you need a job to get through a rough patch, then this company will work. My recommendation is to act like you're drinking the ""Kool-Aid"" but please do not swallow it. Otherwise you might find yourself there 10 years later, getting 25 cent raises each year (maybe), and nothing to really show for your time.

Don't expect your hard work to ever pay off here, at most your rewarded with a 10 cent raise after 2 yrs, there is also no room for growth in that company, everyone there is pretty stagnant and upper management likes to keep it that way. Not only do they expect you to be a their salesman for storage units, you are also their full time Janitor and grounds Keeper. They expect you to go above and beyond and be on point 100% of the time, which is to be expected from any job you work at, but it is always over looked and and never recognized and the praise always goes to the Dm's who are always on some sort on vacation. When the store falls short of there numbers for the month, they suddenly appear and have nothing to do with falling short. CubeSmart proclaims they are all about the Wow culture.. I completely agree when it comes to being their customers.... But dont think for a moment, when its freezing cold out and you have to show an empty storage unit outside your not aloud to where a sweater unless its a company jacket...Come On people ! you sell storage units! A huge number of the General mangers of the stores also are just as skeezy, I have seen first hand some of the most deceitful action come from them and it is always overlooked, because the DMS are never willing to listen to the store mangers who are lower than general managers. Dont let me forget to tell you they have cut most of the holidays.... Do not even think about making plans labor day or memorial day which was taken away, but not for Corporate or the Dm's, and they will be sure to let you know!!!! But when you wanna use the little vacation time you get they will try to tell you how you can and cannot use it.

"Young, Young, Young Favoritism, Favoritism, Favoritism",1.0,"Apr 8, 2015","The benefits program is acceptable, however with increasing costs, the amount of raises need to increase to offset some of the costs.","They say you can't truly enjoy the light until you have experienced the darkness. When at CubeSmart you'll quickly realize that your next job can only be better. The company is a turnover machine. It's extremely difficult to maintain and develop working relationships when people are terminated, quit and/or pushed out of the company. It has come to the point where certain employees are literally being 'forced out' and a fresh crop of 'young' recruits are waiting in the wings. The recent targets are employees that have been with the company for a period of time, and are over the age of 40. Recently, employees that were qualified for positions in management roles were turned down and advancement opportunities were given to males that were under 40 and were friends with certain members of executive management. This has been a pattern for several months. Promotions are given on whether or not you are popular among the executive team. If you brown nose and play the suck-up game, you can climb the ladder much faster than actually having experience. Middle management is completely incompetent and certain positions are held to nepotism. The amount of back-biting is so obvious to everyone that works at the corporate office. You can't trust anyone. Certain employees are the spy's and are used to report back to management what they see and hear. Since when has it come to having employees 'rat' and 'tattle' on others. The executives think they are GODS. It's self storage for crying out loud. Most of them need to come off their high-horses. If they were all as wonderful as they think they are you would think they would have chosen another career path and not storage. As an earlier post stated, treat people as you wish to be treated. It's not that difficult to acknowledge the employees that are making you all RICH! The best news is that one executive is leaving. It's been a long time coming. The sense of relief from the employees is overwhelming. The tormenting and bullying that these employees endured was terrible. It was blatantly obvious that certain people were the TARGET and it was a personal attack. The same 'young' employees are promoted, asked to participate in projects, used in marketing projects/programs. When do you ever see an ""older' employee used? NOT OFTEN! Woman tend to be the most targeted. Woman are spoken down too, paid less than their counter-parts, and are not promoted into executive level roles. The sheer fact that executives feel they can speak to woman in a disrespectful manner and that is acceptable is a problem. On a side note, there are a few things that your executive team should be aware of: A bad boss is the #1 reason why employees quit their jobs. A mass exodus of people leaving or complaining is a bad sign. Ignoring people, and excluding them is a BULLYING tactic.

They hired a few DMs from Public storage, who brought their friends over, and have turned it into a toxic working environment that includes favoritism, gossiping, and cliques. If you’re not in the clique - watch out. Leadership - not long ago you could run the store as if it was your own. They even encouraged that.
