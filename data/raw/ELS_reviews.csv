No Flavor of the Month here,5.0,"Nov 5, 2025","It's a breath of fresh air not to have to peruse the ""flavor of the month"".

I really enjoy working for an organization that has outperformed its peer group for 40+ years. There is a comfortable feeling here that as long as you achieve your goals and are a good team player you will be rewarded.","If you are wanting to work for an organization with a ""start up"" culture, this is not the one for you.

Zero Accountability in MHVillage Management Acquisition,1.0,"Nov 21, 2024","Nothing positive to say.

ELS acquired MHVillage with zero responsibility for management. The marketing department is a nightmare, with fear-based tactics that drain your energy, disrupt your sleep, and erode your sanity from day one. HR’s 30, 60, and 90-day check-ins were useless, ignoring every concern I raised. Employees are treated as expendable, not valued. Two colleagues escaped to different departments to avoid the toxicity, and my predecessor faced the same issues. The blame lies squarely with specific leaders known for creating a toxic work environment. If this review helps one person avoid the misery of working here, it’s worth it. In today’s job market, red flags are easy to overlook, but trust me—if I’d seen this review, I would have run the other way.

Run Down Tired Old Properties Should Be The Warning!,1.0,"Jun 11, 2024","All in all a fairly robust offering of personal paid days off including vacation, personal days, holidays, mental health days, community volunteer day of your choice, etc. Scheduling to use those paid days off was not a problem in any way in the off season. And the Team with which I had the pleasure to work with at the local level and at my property were wonderful. Those of us working hand in hand on a daily basis to help each other (even other property mgrs in my local group) were supportive and fun, and among us felt like a working family environment.

And those big projects with lots of changes were often done without setting up the proper training initiatives or resources to learn the material prior to being live with that program or systems. Then those senior directors start blaming property managers or are used as scapegoats when various teams throughout the company are confused and uncertain how to proceed and mistakes and errors become overwhelmingly apparent. And then these same senior directors turn around and use threats of discipline and termination or simply lay off staff when it's their poor planning and execution of these big projects inevitably begin failing. Turning to the H/R team for any assistance when it's apparent you have been targeted for speaking up about any of this was essentially like jumping out of the frying pan and right into the fire. Metaphorically, a huge bulls eye target was placed on my back where trumped-up allegations were raised against me. Allegations that, when common sense is applied, were all nonsense and may have more to do with me as an individual person than my job performance. Undoubtedly, the worst company I have ever worked for, as what they say they stand for or believe in is far from how they act or what they do.

The Truth about working at ELS Managed Properties,1.0,"Oct 26, 2023","This company has so much potential to be great, but they continue to fail. Working at the ELS corporate office in Chicago probably has some 'Pros' but working elsewhere not so much.","Considering applying for a job with ELS? Please do not. Allow me to first state the fact that all of the somewhat positive reviews of this company are from employees in the Chicago corporate office. Working there is probably great and entirely different. However, working for one of the ELS managed properties around the country is a totally different story. First, health insurance is terrible. I've never worked for a company or even heard of any company that offers top-line health coverage for management only, and then standard / low quality coverage for all other employees. That should speak for itself of how they feel about their front line employees vs management. Management is AWFUL from the top all the way down. They are money hungry looking to collect anything they can from innocent seniors who are just looking for a place to call home, and to enjoy the remainder of their lives in a community. Management and HR do NOT have your back no matter what. They do not stand up for you or back you up regardless of the circumstances. The turnover rate is insanely high, and I've never known a company that will fire an employee at the drop of a dime. The amount of employees that have been fired from ELS is unbelievable. They take their time to fire the employees that should have been fired instantly, vs letting go of their hardworking front line employees for simple things just because they can and for the sake of budget or for a simple complaint. Working hard, putting in your hours plus overtime and going above and beyond your job description will never be enough to save you from losing your job. If you claim to have PTSD you can get away with literally anything. Anything including (but not limited to) getting coworkers fired, getting residents evicted from their home of 30+ years, contacting your bosses boss every day in hopes of getting your boss fired by reporting her daily activities to her boss, not working a full 40 hr. week due to being triggered and needing to go home, just to name a few. The company chooses to keep people like this instead of those who have dedicated themselves to their job, and who take action to make changes for the better. ELS is also way behind the times in terms of the way they do things, and the technology, programs, practices, etc. which I found very bizarre. The bottom line here is that HR is extremely sneaky and can not be trusted. The way they go about things is not right and I would not recommend ELS to anyone.

We have a lot of employees, but you still get the family feel. Everyone is very collaborative within and across departments.

I feel that I have been very lucky in all of my 10+ years here because I have worked with the best people of my career. Before coming to ELS, I worked at 3 other large companies. The people here at ELS have impressed me every day. All of the people I have worked for have inspired me to get to the next level and I learned so much along the way. Also, I had fun doing it which is such a plus! 3)Casual and fun atmosphere. Here at ELS we have casual dress. This just helps to set the tone where you do not have to worry about what wear, within reason of course. This provides a casual atmosphere where you can get down to business and focus on what is important. 4) We are a successful company. It has been a pleasure to work for a growing company and I take pride in knowing that my contribution helped in our growth. 5) Open door policy. Over the years, all of my supervisors have had an open door policy. I was encouraged to come to them with any issues I was having. They left it up to me to determine if I needed extra help with projects or just wanted to vent. This environment helped to make me feel supported. It is now easier for me to set that same tone for my staff, since I have had such great examples.","The only con I can think of is that, like all large companies, we have deadlines and stressful projects. These projects can result in occasionally working long hours and at times having to tell others news they would rather not hear.

You cannot offer an opinion to anyone higher than you because they don't believe you are as intelligent as they are. The CEO must be blind. Our region is clearly in dirty dealings and it's obvious to everyone around. You don't dare make your concerns known since the person responsible clearly lets you know that you can be dismissed at any time. The best way to get promoted is by kissing up to the right people. Merit means nothing to these people. They have mediocre health care at best and if you are less than a manager you have even less insurance. They grandstand about all their purchases and how much those cost but do nothing for the people who work hardest to provide the company with that money. They cannot see anything long term. They are only worried about presenting the monthly numbers to the stockholders. Someone should investigate some of the obvious bad deals they continue to do with the same companies. Looks like someone is probably getting a large kickback. No person in their right mind would continue to have the company getting ripped off unless their hands were dirty.

There aren't many female CEO's around the world so I think this alone speaks a lot to equal opportunity, support and the culture here at ELS. I am proud and inspired beyond what I can put to print here. Employee focus. This is a truly exciting time for the business. We've always cared about our people but we are at a pivotal time where we are putting our heads together and trying to come up with new ways to engage employees, recognize staff and create an even stronger culture. It's a very exciting time to be employed at ELS. We have unlimited potential to grow not only the business but to become a world-class preferred place of employment. I do have to say after reading some of the negative reviews on here I should add a few pieces of feedback to people looking for employment here. This will be tough if you're uncomfortable with ambiguity, need to be micro-managed or without vision and planning skills. If you want to be told what to do and delivered a recipe to success this is not the place for you. Being successful will take diligence, persistence, intentional planning, navigation of ambiguity and someone willing to roll up their sleeves. It's challenging and rewarding work. If you're looking to simply earn a paycheck this is not the place for you. If you're looking for a challenge where you want to see a visible impact, are self-motivated and dedicated to excellence and want to be a part of a rapidly growing organization... welcome.

10 + years I was just a number,1.0,"Jun 11, 2021",My core team and employee was like a family and really enjoying working together. Gained experience working with a very large corporate company. Was able to get contractors and contacts for other career paths.,"I’ve been management for over 15 years so I have experience working with corporate company’s. ELS looks for managers that will just say yes and follow orders. Major micromanaging company! When I first started I had great management above me that supported me and showed they cared about me as a team member. Over the years that changed quickly. I was prompted twice early on and built relationships with my leadership and my team to work effectively. Even though I knew I was under paid for my position I continued to put my best effort, that’s who I am and always will be with every position I am in. They took this for granted and would continue to use me with no thank you or appreciation. I use to received commissions for every sale or rental that my sales associate would fully complete. Now manager get just an override of $50 for every sale or rental. Use to be 3% of sales price, every year for the past 5 years the commission would go down. Human Resources has too much power as well when it comes to hiring or promoting employees. They like to say they promote this is not true at all. I had an administrative assistant that would be amazing as a manager. It took my Regional Manager, Vice President and I too send a letter to head of HR to even get them to look at her. Only received a 2% increase for my employees or less for the last 7 years. I wanted to reward my employees for hard work and dedication I was unable to do this. They took away gift cards for employees and if I asked for more of an increase it would get denied. Upper management does not really know what the issues are at each property. If a resident has a major concerns it just get pushed off or back to the team on site to deal with. Even if they don’t have the authority to fix the issues. So nothing changes for the resident. I worked myself to the point where I was discarding my personal well being and health. My family was becoming second to my job. I became very ill and had to have several surgery’s and doctors appointments. I’m salary and was able to work from home but this was not okay even during COVID. They wanted all managers on site even those corporate employee in Tampa office and Chicago could all work from home during this time. My illness was not do to COVID and still was just pushed aside. My direct manager acted like it was okay and that she understood but truthfully she was just frustrated because it created more work for her. If management was allow to actually manage their core teams I’m sure things would be different. That’s if they hired based on experience not based on how cheap they can get managers. Pay scale is way too low for all employees. I had a housekeeper that was my best employees, never late, always showed up working hard. Wonderful woman with a great heart and amazing attitude. She was always happy and gave the best costumer service to current residents and new tenants. When I left she was making $11.75 an hour, not okay at all!! If you are thinking of a position do your research and talk to current team members on site before making your decision.","Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.",ELS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Equity-LifeStyle-Properties-Reviews-E2281.htm

Terrible company to work for!,1.0,"Jun 4, 2018","They have a good vacation plan, you can earn vacation hours and sick hours fast. You have the major holidays off.","The healthy insurance sucks. It almost doubled after the Healthcare Reform. The hourly employees can barely afford it on the low pay they give you. Speaking of low pay, the amount of work expected is huge compared to what the pay is. The ""call center"", and I use that term very loosely, in MS is a joke. It's in a 40+ year old building that most likely has asbestos in it. There is an older phone system because being cheap, cheap. The call volume ratio to the employees is insane! HIRE MORE PEOPLE ON THE PHONES! Also the hours are not long enough and a ""call center"" being closed on saturday and sunday? That's why the call volume is so high on mondays because it's closed on the weekend. You have happy employees, you have happy customers! Too bad they don't care about that and only care about money and buying more run down parks to add to their list. If I could have given zero stars, I would. Out of the jobs I've had in the past, this was by far the worst one. If you want to have a job to use as a transition towards another one, this is it. If you want a long term one, skip this place. The higher ups have been there too long, play favorites and have no clue. Upper Management has been in their position for too long, are stuck in the old ways and do not want to listen to any suggestions to make the work easier. They make excuses when you try to suggest anything. Too many employees that are there that need to be let go but are kept there due to favoritism. These employees contribute almost zero to the work, yet are still employed. There are too many ""friends and relatives"" that are working here, which makes it hard for the ""outsiders"" to get anywhere. There is a lot of paper waste, due to older employees not wanting to learn how to use technology and continue to print out everything instead of scanning it into Insite. Make a better work environment for your employees. It's a shame that we have to work in a 40+ year old building, with possible asbestos, dust and mold everywhere, leaky ceiling when it rains, half the stalls in the women's bathrooms do not work and it takes MONTHS to get them fixed.

How is that fair to all the people who met the deadline and were threatened to be kicked out if they didn't. Regional management tells property employees that they are not allowed lunch breaks when the CEO is on a site visit. Property employees cannot get any enjoyment out of the parks they tell you cannot speak to the guest after hours you cannot participate in events in the park after hours and you cannot spend time with your own family that is camping In The park either. I witnessed south eastern regional management tell 2 other employees that they could not spend time in the park with their family members that was camping on their own membership.
