Great Place To Work,5.0,"Nov 11, 2025",Great environment. Interesting projects. I look forward to coming to work.,None that I can think of.,Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Smoke and Mirrors... be careful,1.0,"Oct 28, 2025",There weren't too many things I liked about the organization other than meeting some cool people. The bright minds tended to be younger and most often would leave eventually. The salary was competitive... but benefits were pretty meh.,"Probably the most bizarre place I've ever worked. The constant stress of project deadlines that were deemed urgent, micro-managers and directors, executives being extremely toxic and overall just a weird sense of everyone being on edge at all times. They say they care about employee well being, but in the end most of the people that stay for more than a few years are just 'yes' people who play the corporate game. Most of the bright young minds leave after a few years (rightfully so) I often had to bite my tongue in response to how my manager and director would speak to me when something wasn't working as expected. The WFH is a joke.. they say 6 days a month but that comes with caveats... no 2 days in a row, has to have manager approval, can't come before a holiday or after a weekend... it wasn't flexible at all. Additionally, every team is extremely under-staffed... the amount of project requests that would come in.. the team I worked within never had enough time to complete anything with real quality, as it was a mad rush to get it out the door. The firm was extremely wary of hiring more people, yet executive level salaries were insane... just food for thought. Unless you are unemployed or have no other job prospects, I'd carefully consider other opportunities. Obviously everyone's experience is different.. but in a nutshell this was the worst place I ever worked at (my perspective)",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
Good Entry Level Job,2.0,"Mar 12, 2025","Benefits are (were) the best I've experienced in the industry. Plus it's cool to say you work for the company that owns the ""world's most famous building"".","So, I've had the privilege of working at a worse company and a company on par with (or a little better than) ESRT. If you're right out of college, looking for an entry level property management job to spend a couple of years at to get your resume going (because you will not get promoted, not matter how good you are. Rewarding good work or hiring from within is not their jam) you could do worse. The benefits are really good, actually. Although, they changed their bonus structure in order to deny or lower bonuses arbitrarily and they switched their insurance to a lower quality one right as I left, so I can't speak to how the benefits are now. Bottom line--you have to remember that this is a corporation in AMERICA, of all places. They don't care about you beyond if you're losing or making them money, no matter how many free bagel days or lunches they give you. At the end of the day, they will sell your building to make a buck and kick you to the curb with a backdated termination letter (so that they don't have to pay for your insurance, of course), a callous denial of severance (even though they gave all other buildings severance before you), and not even a thank you or goodbye meal (upper management didn't even email the people whose lives they were upending despite knowing them for 10+ years), whether you've worked there for 2 years or 20. In fact, you're probably treated better if you've only been there for 2 years because the CEO or whatever his nepo baby title is has some kind of obsession with Gen Z and doesn't respect lifers. And everyone is TERRIFIED of him so no one will fight on your behalf if they risk going against him. So, yeah. It's a fine place to work if you don't expect to get a lot out of it. You get good experience and meet good people but you'll most likely get stuck in your position with no hope of upward mobility.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

We genuinely care about one another and help each other succeed.","The environment can be fast- paced and stressful but this is not particular to the company- this is the real estate industry in general. We have many policies and protocols in place which can sometimes bog us down but overtime, I have watched us streamline our processes and consistently look for ways to improve.

If you should be so fortunate to prove your worth on the job, prepare for the higher ups to serve you a buffet of inefficiency, incompetence, and ineffective management skills. If you can handle that, management may further ask you to unhinge your jaw and swallow a heaping plateful of responsibilities that you will get 0 credit for (but 100% of the blame if failed) and an all day special of empty promises.

All the executives do what they want when they want and you may get two different conflicting orders from two different executives. Even as a salary based paid employee, we are required to be tracked using a fingerprint scanner. Some departments are no help and you are blamed for work not completing on time or incorrectly done. The benefits are the worst I have ever had the ""pleasure"" of using. Asking for time off, you may be talked down to as if you are a 2 year old child be scolded for not going to the potty. When you mention this to someone in HR that you thought would help, nothing happens. Management and HR seems to ignore the problem because to them the issue is always with the lower level employees.

When employees ask “who qualifies for stock options?”, no one can give a straight answer. The HR department is the most unprofessional I have experienced in my 10+ career in real-estate industry. Incompetent, incapable, and completely useless. The HR department experienced nearly 100% turnover since 2015. Everyone with talent in that department left. Pay increases, bonuses and payroll is horrendous and run by an incompetent manager. There is a huge lack of union and employee knowledge within the HR department. As for the Operations and Finance Departments, they will work you 90+ hours a week and it’s still never good enough. Increases and bonuses are laughable in comparison to the hours worked.

Growth In the Right Direction,4.0,"May 10, 2019","I've been with ESRT for about a year now, serving in a variety of different capacities that have allowed me to witness multiple facets of what it's like to be an employee here. In my experience, there are two pros that stand out the most that have made it a great place to work for me: 1. A Challenging Environment - As mentioned in some of the other reviews here, when you put yourself out there at ESRT, you are rewarded with increasing professional and educational opportunities. I have found that management has consistently challenged me to go above and beyond and learn new things in my professional life. I've been given the opportunity to take great initiative on projects despite not being here for that long, simply because I've spoken up about wanting to be more involved. There are many opportunities for growth here at ESRT and professional improvement is actively encouraged by management. I have yet to be bored here. Obviously, this can vary by department, but I can say that I have been met with overwhelming support and encouragement from management in my department to grow professionally since I started here. 2. Increasingly Receptive Management - I have played witness to a good amount of institutional change here over the last year, all of which has ultimately been very encouraging to see as an employee. Management has been making an increasing effort to listen and respond to the concerns and desires of employees, which has manifested in a steadily growing number of ""office perks"" and the founding of a Culture Committee, as well as a general feeling of an overall culture shift within the organization as management learns to be a bit more relaxed and open to trying new things. Within the span of a year, I feel like management has gone from being very stuffy, close-minded, and out-of-touch to really being in touch with employees and actively engaged in finding new ways to improve the experience of working here at ESRT, which has been great to see and very reassuring. Aside from the aforementioned, I have also had a very positive experience with the work environment itself, and the people who work here. The job respects a work-life balance, the people are incredibly friendly and passionate about what they do, and the office itself is very upscale and conducive to collaboration and interaction among employees. I really do enjoy coming here every day!","Despite its recent progress, the organization is still very reliant on a top-down style of management which has allowed a very bureaucratic environment to thrive. My main frustrations with working here stem from: 1. A Heavy Dependence on Email - My inbox is inundated around the clock thanks to a culture of reliance on email as a primary mode of communication. Slack is not a universally-used application in our office, nor do we use any other sort of IM service for communication. I think this is definitely something that could be improved on in order to reduce inbox clutter and increase efficiency. 2. Lengthy Approval Processes - As I said above, the bureaucracy of the organization is most apparent when trying to accomplish tasks that require several levels of approval. It is understandable to have procedures in place to reduce the company's liability, however there is a such thing as too much. It is not uncommon to spend a great amount of time on a project only for it to be stymied by lengthy approval processes.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm

Tyrannical Totalitarianism at its Best!,1.0,"Jun 10, 2015","Culture, what culture? If tyrannical totalitarianism is the culture you are striving for, this is the company to work for! The individuals working at the Empire State Building and its Observatory are some of the most talented professionals in the industry. Their other properties... not so much.","HR, like most professions, values ethical principles. People are the most important asset of an organization but also its biggest potential liability. One would assume that HR is ethically responsible for promoting and fostering fairness and justice for all employees throughout the organization; however, ESRT’s disparate, discriminatory, and retaliatory practices make HR’s position within the organization obsolete. The greatest liabilities in the organization are the individuals in charge of running it. The top-heavy tyrannical executive office is compiled of “bosses” not “leaders” (all of whom hate each other and refuse to communicate with each other). As Human Capital professionals and culture champions, you know something is deeply wrong with an organization when 80% of the HR department leaves in 6 months to go work for the company’s biggest competitors. The executive office chalks employee resignations up to those resigning as being “bad employees”. If resignations were coming from “bad employees”, I doubt your competitors would be hiring them at double their salaries. When resigning, expect to get shunned from senior management. It is pointless to put in 2 weeks’ notice. During the notice period, not a single person on the senior management team acknowledges your existence. My advice to existing staff is – Get out while you still have what’s left of your morals and dignity. Competitors are looking for your talent and are willing to equitability compensate you for it. My advice to prospective employees is – Unless you’re taking a position making $300K+ a year, its best to keep it moving. Even at $300K a year, employees are dropping like flies.",Empire State Realty Trust,ESRT,Office,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Empire-State-Realty-Trust-Reviews-E980580.htm
