Sun Has It All,5.0,"Feb 20, 2025",Response time and support from upper management is second to none in the industry. Always on the leading edge of changes. Bonus opportunities are abundant.

Happy To Be Part Of Sun,5.0,"Oct 30, 2025","My coworkers are great and most have been with Sun for many years (which speaks volume on the kind of company Sun is, in a good way). The support I get from my team, is appreciated. The pay is decent and lot rent discount is appreciated as well. Hours are typical for my position. I think Sun is a good company to work for, if you are looking for a permanent long-term position.","It's a lot of work at our property due to multiple storms causing damage to the community, so it is hard to leave on time because there is always something to do. Working traditional office hours +some, it is hard to make it to appointments and being new I definitely don't want to miss any work.","Sun Communities, Inc.",SUI,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sun-Communities-Reviews-E2567.htm
Company,4.0,"Nov 1, 2025",Our Park is cleaner to start other than trees. Staff is Friendly most of the time. its a fun place to work. most of the time direct issues get handled in timely manor unless you need something with upper management then there is lots of emails and time passing.,The Jobs at hand are NOT always able to be completed! As a current business owner i would not think that my clientele would want appearance cost so limited like a simple yearly tree trimming in Florida not only for hurricane safety but the resort look we as sun advertise. Next I applied for a much high position simply becuase it became available. although happy in my position the goal is always to thrive and move right um the employment tree! I was told by several managers including my own park it was simply great i wanted to apply for a higher position. But then after applying HR sent an email saying unfortunately you must be with the company for 6 months to apply and i picture of rules where it did in fact say that but right below stating that it is perfectly fine with manager approval while i had my park and my regional Maintenance manager. My corse of action was to email HR and Ask - No response - Call leave voice mail No response twice. These communities can be great places but i also think its not clarified well for the general public on the matter of Mobile home full time living or Resort like vacation feel to 55+ communities. Being newer to the rv world i have been living and traveling in my 5th wheel for two years after selling off some of my businesses. After staying at parks like at silver lake sand dunes Michigan and Gatlinburg Tennessee to the Keys are all awesome Sun RV Parks. But i feel like some of that fun and Sun RV Culture Gets lost with the fulltime communities where people want to create there own rules and management lets it happen. Then The employee benefits are minimal i have temp worked and have friends working for other rv competitors where they have a 50% rent discount if not better. The other issues are the pay has to be based on a national company average and not a local average because Naples Fl with what wadges and cost of living are the numbers do not align and would make it extremely difficult for one to live a life unless your collecting SS and have this job. Mind you i have visited 5 parks in my area where most definitely my statement was correct.

work smarter not harder,5.0,"May 21, 2019","Sun truly does care about it's employees. Upper Management (main office) goes out of there way to touch all of us at events in some way to make us, who are on the ground, feel important. Our events team was amazing, did an awesome job in Atlanta. Hats off to you for all that you do.","With the company being as big as it is, employees most likely do certain tasks differently. You can ask 5 people how to do something and get 5 different answers. So it gets confusing if we are all doing it differently. The one area I feel needs more clarification is ordering homes. We are being pushed to get orders in, we spend the time to get it done then the orders either sit for months without approval or they are denied with little feed back other than the price is too high! We need expectations set and standards of what the homes should have in options before any one spends any time on ordering homes. Price too high is setting us up to fail and wasting our valuable time. We need to work smarter NOT harder.","Sun Communities, Inc.",SUI,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sun-Communities-Reviews-E2567.htm

My particular experience included being completely conned and taken advantage of by a lazy maintenance man who brings new meaning to the word, lazy. Be prepared to collect garbage from all common areas, bleach pool chairs, pressure wash, paint, landscape, pull weeds, and be asked to clean the company vehicles, which he uses regularly, on and off of the clock, and to collect resident trash on pick up day while he is sitting at home while on the clock. Dont bother talking to management because they already know and not only condone it, but will lie and make excuses for him. You can also never expect a tip or anything a guest may leave behind for the housekeeper because he miraculous has time to ransack the rental units and clean them out if anything he may want before you are even told that they have departed. Last but not least, don't expect to be taken seriously if you report any issues.","Sun Communities, Inc.",SUI,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sun-Communities-Reviews-E2567.htm

Not the same as it once was and not all it's made out to be!,2.0,"Dec 5, 2022",On-site gym and Starbucks. Holidays are reasonable.,"The company has grown but done little to increase staff or support but merely dumped more on their existing employees, expecting more and giving little in return, small bonuses and low pay increases add to the frustration. Promotions are only for the select few. You are measured on how vocal you are during meetings, and not your overall work rate. Beware of buses as you will get thrown under them often by upper management, it’s all very cliquey and if you're not a manager or above, you have no voice as nobody will listen to your ideas or opinions. HR does nothing for you. On the plus side, benefits are reasonable, holidays and vacation time is ok and most co-workers are decent people. On-site gym and Starbucks is also a plus.

Best time off program that I have seen.",Very stressful and seem to care more about numbers than people. Every year they found ways to reduce commissions and add job responsibilities.

Refreshing company culture,4.0,"Dec 9, 2016","Unlike the giant auto companies that I've worked for in the past (GM, ThyssenKrupp Automotive), Sun seems to be much more open-minded and diverse and has a friendlier vibe. I'm guessing its relatively small size of several thousand is why it can have a more flexible, modern culture. As a technical writer there, I had the pleasure of working with the upper echelon of leadership, and I found the vast majority of them to be easygoing, communicative, and helpful.","The only downside I noticed is that people shift from one position to another with surprising speed, plus there seemed to be a lot of departmental rearranging and physically moving from one floor to another (they occupy several floors within the same building). But this is probably part and parcel of not being a staid, old-fashioned company.","Sun Communities, Inc.",SUI,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Sun-Communities-Reviews-E2567.htm

They don't look for the degree on the wall, they look at your potential. I work hard at my job but Sun rewards their employees and they make me want to do the best job that I can for the company.","While Sun is increasing the pay for groundskeeper and office coordinators, I feel they are still a little behind in that area.

I feel as if the culture at the corporate office is healthy and the people that work there are genuine and willing to help.,Profits and shareholders will always be the main priority. While it is understandable for a public company the budgeting does not allow for much room to deal with the needs of the communities.

Managers are expected to accept any treatment by customers and apologize for the customers poor behavior. Archaic.
