Bad CEO,2.0,"Jul 23, 2025","Depending on your team, you might be surrounded by good people Remote Work Publicly traded company so higher level access and opportunities","Some teams are not only resistant to working together, but they will actively try to blame your dept and throw you under the bus. Lack of communication is horribly obnoxious. Company continues to try to grow without having a stable foundation. CEO throws his power around and affects the entire company poorly. He refuses to listen to other people or admit when he has made bad choices, preferring to double down and dig the company into a deeper hole. Overworked and underpaid for the amount of effort you put in.",National Storage Affiliates,NSA,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/National-Storage-Affiliates-Reviews-E2469764.htm
Better oportunites elsewhere,1.0,"May 2, 2025",Working with your team. not much esle,As an area manager your day is typically spent putting out fires. You are dragged to and fro just trying to stay afloat with constant immediate priority task. Your nights will be spent trying to catch up on administrative work from the day before. your weekends are spent on adminstrative and payroll based task as well as answering priorty calls from the call center. You will not have a day off. You are expected to be in stores all day monday through friday. They strongly encourage you to be in stores saturday. If one of your managers are off you are expected to cover that store. if more than one is off you are expected to cover all of them. All your stores will have low staffing and few if any contengency managers. Culture is toxic overall. It is focused on accountability particularly for regional managers or below. The only excuse why something did not get completed is that you failed and nothing else matters. Need to be in 3 different places at once and work 16 plus hours days. Thats not an excuse not to get another thing done. They will send you out test asking you take a picture in front of an object in front of your store within 30 minutes to verify you are there. Upper management is obsessed with change. you will constantly get bombarded with new systems and processes. These are not veted before you get them so there will be bugs. Current push is mobility. AMs no longer get laptops or cellphones. Everything must be done through a tablet or an AM's personal phone.,National Storage Affiliates,NSA,Self-storage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/National-Storage-Affiliates-Reviews-E2469764.htm

They have been unable to assist me in rolling over my 401k for almost a year since I was let go. They don’t respond to emails about the matter and when they do they barely read the email that I sent to them. Also management is generally cliquey and immature. I was fired after less than 4 months without ever having a serious conversation with a manager. You might think I’m exaggerating but I’m not. The week before I was fired the director personally told me I was doing well. The next time I saw him they were terminating my for “performance reasons.” They never went into detail past that. Even after me asking just for feedback, wanting to know what I did wrong so I wouldn’t do it again, they never told me.
