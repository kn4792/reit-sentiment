Really impressed with this company,"Sep 8, 2025","After spending a decade in big tech, I was surprised to find a company that takes many of the great attributes and leaves the negative aspects of many other big Silicon Valley corporations (in my experience since being here 1.5 years). From the comprehensive (and fun!) multi-day, in-person onboarding trainings, to company-wide volunteer days (IMPACT Day), social events that embrace different cultures and celebrate diversity - Prologis is a company that invests in its employees. I also appreciate that it routinely asks employees what it can do better, and listens. Teams are continually driving towards excellence - whether that’s finding a more effective process or implementing new technology to help teams work smarter. But in my experience, being “human” is still valued. People lead with kindness and empathy in a way that feels really genuine. The cascading effect creates a team dynamic that is pretty rare in my experience.","For those that love remote work, we’re currently in the office 3x/week (may vary based on the team). At least the snacks are good :)","Prologis, Inc.",PLD,Industrial,2025-11-18,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Prologis-Reviews-E2631.htm

I’ve felt empowered to ask bold questions, bring new ideas forward and collaborate with incredibly thoughtful and driven teammates. The culture here is proactive, supportive and genuinely human. Prologis doesn't just talk about making an impact, we live it every day together","Prologis moves at such a fast pace and sets a high bar for performance, it can take time to adjust if you're new to the industry or not used to cross-functional collaboration.

Horrible Place to Work,"Aug 26, 2025",They promote people fast if you are a part of their clique. Good work life balance if they like you.,"I had the worst experience working here. I was blindsided with a poor performance review and given vague, unhelpful feedback that made no sense. My boss excluded me from meetings, spoke to me poorly, and held grudges whenever I made mistakes. Leadership encouraged me to “keep improving,” and offered to mentor me only to lay me off six months later. The VP was incompetent and openly said horrible things about her employees, while showing favoritism toward men in the office. Overall, leadership is a joke unprofessional, toxic, and completely lacking in accountability. I'm not sure how my boss thinks she is a good one.

Real Culture. Amazing People.,"May 23, 2025","The culture here is truly special. People are kind, authentic, and genuinely invested in one another’s success. It's not uncommon to meet colleagues who’ve been here for 5, 10, even 15+ years—something that feels almost unheard of these days. That kind of longevity speaks to how much people care about the work and each other. Access to leadership is another standout—our C-suite is approachable, down to earth, and easy to talk to. It’s a highly collaborative environment where integrity and doing what’s right (especially for the planet) are more than just stated values—they’re part of the day-to-day decision-making.","Like any fast-moving company, things can change quickly, and sometimes communication doesn’t always keep pace. Cross-functional alignment can occasionally be a challenge as teams navigate shifting priorities. Also, because so many people stay here long term, career movement can feel slower unless you actively seek out new opportunities or advocate for your own growth.","Prologis, Inc.",PLD,Industrial,2025-11-18,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Prologis-Reviews-E2631.htm

One of the Best Companies I've Ever Worked For,"Sep 13, 2024","#1 is the culture at Prologis. People are kind and generally trying their best. We work hard but we pause to have fun. I also love that each region has their own sub-culture that makes it fun to visit, learn, and collaborate. Leadership has a vision for the company and genuinely cares about its people. The company is headed in the right direction. Some of the newer departments are still in startup mode figuring things out and can be messier, but there are a lot of things to be excited about and customers are overall happy with the products/services offered. Prologis is a company that practices what it preaches. We actually, seriously, care about ESG and reducing our impact on the environment, compared to other places I've been where it looks more like greenwashing. I feel well compensated for my work, and for the most part my work/life balance is fantastic. It helps that we get lots of vacation time (that I actually feel comfortable taking) and even a few days off per year to volunteer.","I would love to see more diversity in exec leadership roles (women, POC, and age) for fresh perspective. But I will say this has improved even in the few years that I've been here, and DEI is a newer group that has been established. As a global company, we have the challenge of communicating across geographies, time zones, and languages. We do a better job than even some smaller companies I've worked for, but still have some room to improve here.","Prologis, Inc.",PLD,Industrial,2025-11-18,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Prologis-Reviews-E2631.htm
