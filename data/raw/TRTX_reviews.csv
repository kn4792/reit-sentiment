Toxic culture and unsustainable work environment,1.0,"Sep 15, 2025","Free parking, free lunch, friendly teammates for the most part","You may be brought in at a relatively high salary, but you’ll need to account for minimum 60 hour weeks and likely zero raises even with . Your work hours will be expected to match those of the investment teams on both coasts (9-9 is standard in calm periods, few of which existed when I left). They will continue to hire team members in NYC for double your salary who often work half the hours. HR preaches diversity while only hiring minorities into coordinator or EA roles that have no growth opportunities. Management makes it very clear back office should be grateful to be allowed in their presence, the FW office is the ugly stepchild. The toxic culture is palpable, everyone has seemed more and more miserable over the last few years and the response has been additional layoffs. This is all in addition to the standard woes of PE that are alive and well at TPG; the “boys club” culture, rampant elitism, forget work life balance you will not have a life, etc. They seem to believe if they use Goldman as a direct funnel for new hires they won’t realize they’re being overworked and have managed to build an even worse working environment with worse work life balance.","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

Disappointing Culture for Women – Disrespect and Double Standards,1.0,"Jun 20, 2025",Catered lunch and paid parking,"Very low pay, old office space. During my short time at the company, I witnessed and experienced a deeply concerning dynamic, particularly for women. There’s a clear expectation that women remain agreeable and accommodating at all times—even in the face of disrespect or inappropriate treatment. Speaking up is often met with defensiveness or dismissal, rather than support or accountability. There are no clear expectations made my mid level managers It felt like being seen less as a professional and more as someone expected to “keep the peace,” no matter the cost. Women who advocate for themselves or set boundaries are labeled as “difficult,” while those who stay silent are taken advantage of. It creates a toxic double standard where abuse is tolerated if it’s coming from the top down—and women are expected to absorb it without protest.","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

Excellent fully paid benefits. Job duties are clearly defined and pretty straightforward.","Don't expect any variety in your day-to-day tasks. I supposed some departments may have more variety than others, but generally speaking, the EA role at TPG is limited to booking travel, scheduling calls/mtgs, and preparing expense reports. It's good place to be if you don't need to be challenged and don't mind feeling like you're in a rut after just 2 weeks. Most Admins can expect to help out at the front desk answering phones and greeting guests when the receptionist needs to take breaks. This can be disruptive to your day when you're trying to get things done but keep getting called up to reception for bathroom breaks. As far as upward mobility goes, there isn't much.

TPG Fort Worth is where dreams come to die,2.0,"Mar 28, 2021","-Everyone is interested in doing what’s right for investors -Great business- TPG is always ahead of the curve and thinking outside of the box -TPG hires great people. Just about everyone is intelligent and competent, and nice to work with -Senior management is out of San Francisco and holds high standards in terms of diversity and inclusion, which is heavily supported by FW management. The company is especially supportive of LGBT employees -The support employees give to charitable initiatives is truly heartwarming. There are some ongoing charities the firm supports, and employees go above and beyond to support these causes. For example- care packages for the troops, fundraising for the cystic fibrosis foundation, and a clothing drive for an LGBT teen homeless shelter showed everyone jumping in with their donations and their time -All the free food you can dream of (pre-pandemic) -Company is taking the pandemic seriously - everyone is working from home","-Massive divide between the “front office” (SF) and “back office” (FW). From the perspective of SF, back office is nothing and the only interaction between the two offices is through a few very senior individuals. There’s no understanding or appreciation of all the work that goes on in FW to support front office. -Crazy amounts of turnover. Considering that TPG has a great business, a respected name, pays well for the market, and hires the best, this shouldn’t be. -Crushingly hierarchical. Strong attitude by management that everyone should “stay in their place” and that only the most senior should have their voices heard. And even then, even the most senior often have no control over their careers. Job functions will change on the whims of management, even if it doesn’t make sense. Some of it has to do with the high amount of turnover, but uprooting the entire way the system works isn’t the way to plug a hole -While there are so many smart and competent people around, it’s more likely that an incompetent person who knows how to throw around business buzzwords and play the politics game will get promoted -I’ve never seen so many great people so beaten down by a place – management has no regards at all for the interests, background, or skill sets of employees. It doesn’t matter what you are hired to do- the job you were hired into can change out from under you out of nowhere, or you could be plucked out of your job at any moment and thrown into a new role you have no interest or experience in. Don’t get too comfortable with the manager who hired you- that’s very likely to change multiple times -Nothing ever improves- people are rarely left in a role long enough to become proficient and begin to improve the process and make things more efficient. Constant thrown-in learning mode. If someone doesn’t feel like doing something, they can just ignore it until everyone’s job changes again and it’s someone else’s problem. Manual processes galore thanks to expensive new systems put in that are only 90% of the way integrated -No training. Sink or swim mentality -Culture of fear. When something goes wrong (and it will) and it makes the “back office” look bad, management is very quick to point a finger at someone and fire them. Because of this blame culture, people are hesitant to take ownership of things. Because nobody takes ownership and jobs change so often, there’s a lot left up in that air that doesn’t end up getting done","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm

At all. Very hierarchical. Administrative staff at the very bottom of the chain and indirectly, made to feel that way. Perks abound at all levels but not if you are an admin (firm conferences, new hire dinners, team building retreats...not if you are an admin). Huge dichotomy between investment teams and administrative professionals. Very little (almost zero) training. A few sessions are offered here and there for new technologies, but don't expect any new hire training as an admin. You'll receive an administrative handbook, desk, computer and access to all the supplies you need, but there is no ramp up and no formal new hire training for administrative staff. None. As a result, people are left to sink or swim and sadly, some good people leave b/c they weren't afforded the resources or time to find their feet. High turnover. Mostly admins seem to be fed up or find something more interesting, in light of all the benefits and pay. Senior management doesn't seem to know anything about what the administrative staff experiences and they don't inquire about it either. Some tenured administrative assistants have moved up the chain in to interesting roles, but that is few and far between. Overall, if you are an admin and corporate culture is important to you, then this is not the place.

It's a dynamic work environment and not a place where you'll be bored to tears. There are some great people here, but also some atrocious personalities.","Where to begin... it can be extremely political. It's not who you hitch your wagon to, but who they hitch your wagon to. You will watch people continue to get promoted not necessarily for their skills/knowledge, but because they are visible and have a director who fights for them. Other directors and senior managers will deliberately hold people back from progressing in their careers. Some junior to early management level staff go above and beyond and the response from upper management is ""that's what is expected"" while others just do their job and are deemed to be promotable. They'll also promote you if they think you're going to quit, so people have successfully played that card (something to consider). There is no sense of development of skills and knowledge. No true and comprehensive training. They want people to stay in the position they are in because it's too difficult to replace them. They will say that the firm promotes and encourages lateral movement between teams, but that is seldom the case, and they will likely pay recruiters heaps of money to hire externally before ever considering someone internally. Many of the senior managers and managers are not true ""managers"" or leaders; they are subject matter experts on their funds, and have little ability to grow, develop, and teach the people reporting to them. The culture is very poor under a thinly veiled attempt at fun and friendly. Be very ready to be thrown under the bus by your Manager/Sr. Manager if something goes wrong, and for them to withhold promotion because of it.

The international team has a great leader- Amrit, who’s an absolute delight to work for.","It’s a contract job at best. Hiring and firing is rampant, which gives you zero job security. Don’t expect any kind of horizontal or vertical growth within the company. You’ll be in the same role, doing the same thing. Involvement and centralised decision making from US can be a source of stress and inconvenient timings for anyone working in Europe or Asia. There is a dire need for HR practices in place. You will have no public holidays and leave requests are a battle to fight. The suggested model of dials to conversion places a massive focus on quantity over quality. There seems to be extreme scrutiny in place. Secret monitoring etc. It creates an environment of lack of trust. Not a great foundation for a remote company. The business model almost encourages you to treat this job as a stop gap.
