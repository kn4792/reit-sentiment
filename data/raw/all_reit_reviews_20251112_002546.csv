Long-term employee POV,3.0,"Sep 21, 2016",During much of my time I worked in a stable environment. I had great support from my direct leadership and my projects were funded as needed. It was a challenging environment where I was expected to deliver consistent results. And that was something that I welcomed. You were paid well and the benefits were good. I worked with many great employees during my time.,"Starting around 2007 the company changed. Senior management changed out and several former GP employees were brought in. Many felt the organization should run like GP. The problem was that Rayonier wasn't organized like GP & didn't have the resources to do what they did. Instead of honoring long-term values, the company changed. It became a very political organization where results did not matter as much as appearances.

While no place is perfect, I find here that most people get along really well, and we're getting better and better at crossing lines between departments and working together in a really beneficial way. They have a good rewards system to recognize employees who go above and beyond, pay a nice bonus once a year and benefits are good with a match on your 401k contributions.","One challenge the company has is keeping the momentum going in all of its many locations -- so, for example, is the culture and enthusiasm the same in one office as it is in another?

They recently adopted a new labor contract stating that all new hires will forfeit 20% of their starting salary for the first two years of employment. In exchange for that the existing members that have worked there for a good link. Of time gain a bonus week of vacation and sick leave each year.
