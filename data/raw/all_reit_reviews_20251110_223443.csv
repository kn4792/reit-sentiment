They worry about keeping things private even amongst employee They have restrictive practices in Technology, which even hinders one's work and many have said they don't have access to basic things required for their daily work.

Toxic Environment and Limited Career Advancement,2.0,"Mar 10, 2025","The company offers a solid benefits package that promotes a healthy work-life balance. Leadership within my department and across the company values grit and initiative, recognizing those who go above and beyond. Executives are committed to the long-term success of the company and focus on sustainable growth. However, opportunities to collaborate with others are limited, and while there is a strong sense of inclusivity when discussing the company’s future, the lack of clear advancement paths and middle management improvements hinder the overall culture.","Unfortunately, I experienced second-class treatment under my manager. Despite my hard work, I was often sidelined with fewer opportunities for advancement and recognition compared to those in favor with management. The culture encouraged snitching, which, combined with favoritism, fostered a toxic work environment. Those who aligned with management were rewarded, leaving others feeling unsupported. The uneven workload, lack of transparency, and poor communication created an atmosphere of disrespect and disillusionment, making me feel undervalued and isolated.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Organization of dysfunction and toxcicity,1.0,"Sep 13, 2024",Decent healthcare plan Employee Stock plan,"Working in this organization was a deeply disappointing experience, marred by a complete lack of rationality and logical thinking within the decision-making process. The workplace culture is characterized by an alarming tendency to ignore expertise and embrace reactionary decision-making, leaving employees feeling undervalued and unsupported. One of the most glaring issues is the blatant disregard for the valuable insights provided by department managers. Some senior leaders consistently sideline their expertise, opting instead to heed decisions made by a select group of individuals who lack any relevant experience in the areas they are making decisions. This approach not only undermines the expertise of dedicated professionals but also leads to misguided choices that harm the organization in the long run. Promotions and significant raises, crucial aspects of career growth, are only awarded in select departments, and are not necessarily based on merit or skills, but on the basis of cronyism and favoritism. This nepotistic approach not only demoralizes employees who work hard and demonstrate exceptional skills but also fosters a toxic work environment where office politics reign supreme. Genuine talent is systematically ignored, leaving employees feeling insignificant and undervalued. Another alarming aspect of the workplace environment is the tendency to make sweeping cuts without fully understanding the ramifications. Impulsive cost-cutting measures are implemented without a comprehensive analysis, leading to decreased employee morale, increased workload, and overall dissatisfaction. These decisions have a domino effect on productivity and employee well-being, ultimately affecting the organization's overall performance. In conclusion, this workplace is a prime example of an organization where rationality, logic, and fair decision-making are sacrificed at the altar of favoritism, cronyism, and short-sightedness. Many employees are left disheartened and demoralized, leading to a toxic work environment that stifles creativity, innovation, and genuine professional growth.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

I have been in companies during transitions and by far the transition within this company has been far from smooth. Corporate pushing out new systems and programs prior to it being fully ready then retracting, and pushing out again to find more issues and so forth. Always being told to check P&P, however, No clear procedures even on website where employees are to go and find Policies & Procedures and a lot information is outdated. This makes it more challenging for newcomers. Be ready to do plenty of self research and more research to find answers. Lack of communication between departments. Very clique and favoritism is noticed. Negative comments about other co workers and past co workers from managers frequently. Certain departments get more leeway on deadlines while other are expected to always meet it. Almost no work/life balance.

"Karma - Enjoy NY, Tom.",1.0,"Sep 29, 2017",Unfortunately at this time the company has absolutely nothing going for it. On the outside it can look and feel glamorous but it's the complete opposite.,"Day one Tom DeRosa came into the company telling everyone how down to earth he was, that he was an employee advocate and so much more. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Tom has been anti-Toledo since day one. The University of Toledo was never good enough to hire graduates or interns from. All new employees should live in Ann Arbor because Toledo wasn't good enough for people of his caliber. As a proud graduate of the University of Toledo that was all so disappointing. Tom has finally gotten his way. He looks like the hero donating the building and property to the University of Toledo but in reality it was only done to get his way and that is out of Toledo. Management continued to lie to employees that the building they were constructing in NY was not meant for a new headquarters. While it may not be the headquarters now, Tom will be working out of that office. Mark my word, eventually the headquarters will be in NY and the hardworking employees that have held it out during the chaotic and stressful times will no longer have a job. To the current employees, don't be afraid to move on. While people say the grass isn't always greener on the other side, I can promise you that this time it will be.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm
Epic Fail,1.0,"Sep 27, 2017",It pays the bills. The corporate HQ was nice when Welltower owned it. The temperature in the building isn't too bad.,"This organization went from stellar to rock bottom in 12 months. Without ever addressing its new ""course of action"" with its employees, Welltower did a complete 180 and terminated about 30% of its workforce. It became a completely strange and confusing environment. Sadly, many important tasks aren't being completed due to the lack of staff. Current management is so focused on cutting compensation that they're not addressing the real struggles within the organization. Recently, Welltower donated its 100 acre Dorr Street (Toledo) campus to The University of Toledo. Nice save. The perfect opportunity to contradict all of the negative reviews that claim that the CEO doesn't live in Toledo nor does he care about the community. That job is done. This left the Toledo (Corporate HQ) based employees wondering what this means for their future in the company. Why would a real estate company give away a $30M piece of real estate if they plan to grow their HQ in Toledo? They don't. It's a slow kill, and it seems like this company is phasing its way out of the Toledo community. This will leave so many good, hard-working employees devastated. As for Welltower's claims that they are in the utmost compliance with regard to employee ethics, managers were instructed to grant nothing higher than a 3 rating on their reports' annual performance reviews. That means that Welltower has no intention of paying their employees based on performance. It's just a lure. What is ironic, is that Welltower only has a 2.6 rating on Glass Door. That's karma for you.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Poison in the Well,1.0,"Apr 13, 2017",The cafe is pretty nice...,"I was initially positive about the prospect of change under the new executive management, headed by DeRosa and Mitra. Unfortunately, they have ham-fisted change management, and have squandered an opportunity to elevate the company to a more sustainable and long-term path to growth. Indiscriminately firing employees and falsely labeling the terminations as “for performance,” they have focused simply on head counts and cost-cutting for what can only be viewed as a setup for the company to be a take-over target by private equity, or some other buy-out of the current shareholders. Employees are scared and cringing, when they should have been empowered and impassioned. DeRosa has failed to impress with his leadership, and one can only surmise that the clock is ticking on the remaining 2 ½ years of his current contract to complete the deal. The duo of DeRosa and Mitra is about the most unlikely pairing one can imagine, and it’s likely they were dropped into place by much larger external players to grease the skids. Make no mistake, the employees are being fed a false bill of goods when they are told that the remaining “lucky” ones are in for some wonderful financial reward. The light they are told to look at is not the end of the tunnel, it’s another train.",Welltower Inc.,WELL,2025-11-10,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Welltower-Reviews-E1166198.htm

Great place to learn a ton about the industry.","Most of the cons of working at a large company apply here.

Lack of recognition from upper management can lower morale at the bottom. Office politics seems to be a big deal here. HR team: Inconsistency and lack of transparency regarding performance evaluation makes it difficult to know what needs to be improved, requires a lot of reading between the lines which can be difficult.
