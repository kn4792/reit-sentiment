Entry Level Position,5.0,"Nov 20, 2024","Wonderful company to work for, Great work life balance and great coworkers.",Benefits are average for market.,InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm
Mostly Great Experience,5.0,"Sep 27, 2024",Amazing culture of honest kind people who are willing to help even if it's not within their scope.,"Because of ""awkward"" company size of over 100, upward mobility doesn't happen quite as frequently as mega-corporations.",InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm

Not all that they make it out to be,2.0,"Mar 5, 2014","I'll admit, the pay is awesome. They have great benefits too!","My two supervisors are extremely condescending and don't seem to let your voice be heard. EVERY LITTLE THING you do has to be approved by corporate. There is no creative freedom because all of their marketing is the same company wide (which is stupid because all markets are different). Instead of sending someone to the property to help with leasing efforts when they decide to have the highest prices in the market when they aren't the newest property around, they look for ways to blame the staff for the property not succeeding.",InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm
"""Eh"" is really the only way to describe it.",3.0,"Apr 28, 2015","Flexibility and trustworthiness (at least at our properties location). Employees are allowed to use their best judgement in decision making, time and request off are usually approved. Co-workers are easy to get along with (at least at our location).","Characteristics of the company vary across all properties. It is often times hard for rectify situations at the property site when having to deal with corporate for approval. Corporate overseers are less likely to trust property management, and thus, makes it hard for the individual properties to operate. Pay is similar to a fast food restaurant unless you are higher up in the company (management level and up). Also, t-shirts and uniforms are absolutely terrible, especially at student the housing properties. It is clear that there is a 40 year-old woman with a strict budget designing them who is also out of touch with what college students might actually want to wear. I've seen residents use them as rags to clean their houses personally….",InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm
Working at InvenTrust Properties,4.0,"Aug 19, 2022","One of the best parts of working at InvenTrust is the people! Everyone is so nice and fun and always willing to help! Another great part is the flexibility, IVT offers permanent half day Fridays and a hybrid work schedule! IVT has great company culture, they love to plan fun events and are always making efforts to donate to charities or give back to the community. Lastly, a great perk is the yearly bonus employees receive!",I think PTO could be slightly improved at InvenTrust.

Review from a former real estate asset manager.,3.0,"Feb 16, 2017","Inland American has a wide variety of sophisticated real estate assets on which to work. The company is reasonably accomplished in its approach to the real estate business. In particular, it is willing to advance people within the organization with non-traditional real estate backgrounds.",The company has struggled to adjust to more developed ways of performing real estate investment analysis to match its strength in property management and operations. It is reluctant to change.,InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm
Assistant Community Manager,4.0,"Oct 4, 2014","Great company to work for! Lots of fun and corporate really knows how to make things a blast. Paid company training, support for any issues or help you may need and great incentives.",Extreme micro-management and lower salary than average property management companies.

I feel appreciated by the company, and that we are working as a team towards the same goal.","Because of high expectations, and a desire to do well, it is a struggle to establish a work/life balance. I had to train myself to not work outside my hours, and still find myself working extra to feel a sense of completion/accomplishment.",InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm

Do not work for this company!,1.0,"Feb 27, 2017",The pros are you will meet a lot of really great people. The culture of the employees is much different from the culture of management and executives.,"Executives create an unstable employment opportunity through their decisions to make money available for investment purposes. They are inconsistent and make annual, random job cuts. The company is unorganized and technology/processes are dated. Your loyalty as an employee will not be reciprocated even when you are a good employee, if they see a need to save money, you will be on the list. So don't plan on long-term employment or anything innovative that would even bolster your experience. If you don't want to be back in this boat, looking for employment, do NOT waste your resume space here. It will only give you a short term experience that will leave recruiters questioning why, later.",InvenTrust Properties Corp.,IVT,Retail,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InvenTrust-Properties-Reviews-E1403652.htm
