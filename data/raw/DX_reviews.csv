An Excellent place to learn!,5.0,"Jun 25, 2020",Professional and friendly environment. Clear expectations and communication. Awesome teammates that go out of their way to help you! Very committed to growing your skill sets and helping you learn.,No cons except try to include your interns in more of the meetings and decision making processes. It's makes things a little more clear when we hear the conversations leading up to certain decisions. Mostly for learning purposes!,"Dynex Capital, Inc.",DX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Dynex-Capital-Reviews-E555.htm
