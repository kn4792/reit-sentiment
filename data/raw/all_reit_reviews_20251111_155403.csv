There is no path forward for growth. They won’t even give you an arbitrary title change that comes with a minimal pay bump because they don’t want to “saturate the roster”. Meanwhile, at least on my team, we all did the same amount of work and only one person had the attorney 2 title to match. HR won’t address your concerns head on. The company recognizes that this is just a launching point for attorneys so they don’t attempt to create any retention.

Toxic Leadership,2.0,"Jul 3, 2025",I learned what not to do & what I will/will not take from an employer.,Leadership can have relationships with each other that is cliquey. I hated feeling like I was working to make my leadership look good to theirs. I found myself having to teach myself a lot things and receiving guidance that was inaccurate when push came to shove and leadership not taking accountability. Upward mobility doesn't seem like a real thing. I feared that the flexibility offered was special but I have since found that others will offer it to you and that there's nothing special about a job that has leadership that prioritizes favoritism vs potential or that keeps you mediocre at industry standards at very best.,American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

When new hires and contractors are treated better than full time employees there is a problem. There is no work life balance, we have consistently gone more back to the office, 1>2>3 days in the office with expected 5 days this coming year. No direct promotion or ladder to climb here. Lots of high turn over resulting in the senior folks carrying most of the load, wearing multiple hats.

A Masterclass in Corporate Greed,1.0,"Apr 16, 2025",I don’t work here anymore.,"American Tower has a deep income inequality problem. The median employee salary is just $59,881, yet in 2023, then-CEO Tom Bartlett made $19.7 million, including over $15 million in stock awards. His successor, Steve Vondran, earned nearly $6.9 million, with $5 million in stock. Meanwhile, long-time employees with 10 years of service were earning around $70,000. The company has a staggering 329:1 CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio, yet provides minimal raises, limited upward mobility, and no meaningful retention strategy. What makes this disparity even more striking is that American Tower brought in over $10 billion in revenue in 2023 — despite Glassdoor inaccurately listing it in the $1–5 billion range. This is not a struggling business. It’s an ultra-profitable corporation that actively underinvests in the people keeping it running. American Tower made $2.1 billion in profit in 2023 with about 6,400 employees. If they raised average salaries by $20,000, it would cost roughly $128 million — only about 6% of their net income. That’s it. A single-digit percentage of profit could lift people into competitive, livable compensation — especially those who’ve been loyal for years. Instead, the company funnels tens of millions into executive stock awards while long-timers barely see cost-of-living raises.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

Toxic Culture focused on squeezing employees for as much as they can. Micromanagement. Micromanagement. Micromanagement. Management team is entrenched in ""Cliques"" of friends who have worked with each other ""forever."" Political games to undercut people/gain power is the name of the game here. It is expected that employees work nights and weekends to keep up with the overloaded amount of assigned work. Flexibility in my group is non-existent. The amount of time leaders have raised their voices and yelled at employees in meetings is alarming. This type of treatment is rewarded by senior management and viewed as ""Driving the Business"" Stretch assignments! AKA additional work that you have to squeeze in for no reward or recognition. Any where you hear the term ""Work Boyfriend or Work Wife"" is an absolute red flag. Everything is policed. Parking. Wifi usage. Badge tracking. Kitchen use. time in and out of the office. active time at computer. lunch. summer hours.

The job itself is logical, and once you get your feet planted you feel yourself growing.","Mandatory office attendance on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Not a lot of opportunities to get to the next level. In the 3 years I was there, I saw 1 person be promoted from senior to manager. There are several seniors who are ready or almost ready for the leap, but not a need for more managers. So it’s kind of halting our career progression. Further, without a promotion, the annual salary increase is not matching the market rate for new hires. This causes turnover, which makes the job harder for those who stay. The generous bonus does offset this some, but I gained no buying power with my annual increases (and honestly lost some since inflation is so high)",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

A few are good, many are bad, and it's a country club. If you complain up the chain, you will be disliked by management and likely see worse performance reviews, and HR is no help at all. Your job will not necessarily be what you're hired for. Your responsibilities won't match the description, and will change without your input or any increase in pay. Negotiation is frowned upon. Management knows best is the mantra. If you push back or give too much feedback, you will be marked as non-compliance and not given promotions or raises. Continue to give too much feedback and they'll find a reason to fire you. Inconsistent management styles. Poor communication between teams and up the chain.

"Layoffs, Production Mill, Emotionally Reactive VP",1.0,"Oct 10, 2023",You don't have to work hard here. You will get promoted just by virtue of being here longer than someone else.,"Recently the company had lay offs. The company claims to have cut costs elsewhere but is continuing forward with moving us to a brand new multi million dollar office at Fenton, continue to sponsor events for politicians and spending money elsewhere instead of caring about there people. Those that were laid off were told there are open positions that they could apply for, so instead of removing positions with nobody currently working them, active employees were laid off. Personally I believe this is the first of many lay offs within the department. Many within the department are now actively seeking other employment. Within the Engineering Department the Vice President used this as an opportunity to lay off anyone who had questioned him/management in the past. Some of the top engineers are gone instead of those with months of experience or any of the interns. The ""culture"" within the office is horrible. We have been told in the past ""put your head down and work."" Any attempts to improve culture are met with resistance from management, then every department meeting the VP tells us the culture is great and thriving. An engineer asked how we would improve culture once we move to the new office where nobody has a personal desk where they could have picture of their families anymore. Instead of trying to address the concerns the VP openly accosted the engineer in front of the entire department and told them not to question the new office. Overall this place is a production mill, you will get 8-10 collective hours of training at the most then its trial by fire. The only thing that matters is if you hit your production numbers, the work doesn't even have to be correct. I have personally witnessed a registered PE lower the windspeed on a project to get it to pass then say ""lets hope the jurisdiction doesn't notice"" so we would not have to pay to reinforce the structure. There is no opportunity for developing your engineering abilities, no matter how much you seek it out. The department is moving towards a complete automation model where the engineer never touches the analysis. The department is headed in the wrong direction and I believe over the next few years this place will be a skeleton of what it once was. Once automation is set up there is no need for more than 25% of the current staff.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

It's almost as if the company doesn't trust employees to do their jobs when they aren't being watched. Witnessed insecure management be threaten by truly talented individuals and publicly degraded individuals repeatedly to the point where people quit. There are lifers at this company and then there are departments with high turn over rates because people get worn down so quickly. Departments are completely segregated and have issues communicating across team lines. The word ""silo"" is thrown around in yearly town halls, but nothing is ever accomplished or corrected. The company claims they want to foster a community that is like ""family,"" however they do not listen to the survey responses they are given and continue to do things the same way. The company likes to ""run lean"" at the risk of employees not being able to complete tasks or live up to expectations.

Great company,5.0,"May 9, 2017","After working for years at numerous other companies, I knew I had a good thing when I found ATC. It’s a great company to work for with great people and great benefits. The culture is positive and the people are friendly. I genuinely believe that hard work is recognized at ATC and good performance and strong work ethics are encouraged and rewarded. There is always an opportunity to learn and grow as long as a genuine interest is demonstrated by the employee. ATC starts new employees with an above-average number of vacation days, which increases the longer you are with the company. ATC schedules events, has a business casual dress policy and, in my opinion, has a real interest in trying to make it happy and fulfilling place to work. The company has monthly trainings on industry-relevant topics, periodic online classes and many seasoned employees who are willing to teach the business. Upward mobility is certainly an option at ATC; however, tenure alone does not equal a promotion and that is why the company is where it is today with qualified management. If you are intelligent, enthusiastic and hardworking, there is a very long runway at ATC. If you are not willing to do the work and try hard – you may have a different experience. At the end of the day, it is still a job, so.. am I saying that every minute of every day is filled with unicorns and rainbows? No. But, it’s a really great place to be and, in my experiences, I haven’t found anything like it.",I do not currently have any to share.,American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

The office manager does a wonderful job of ensuring the workspace is conducive to productivity.","It's a large corporation, which comes with downsides. It's a hierarchical organization, and there's a lot of red tape to get anything done. Most employees aren't empowered to make decisions, with almost everything requiring the sign-off of a VP or SVP. Many teams seemed top heavy - a lot of bosses and not quite enough people to do the day-to-day tasks. There was an issue with lack of recognition for the time/effort it takes to get things done. The overall compensation package was solid, but base salary was on the low side. Hard work and high-quality performance were often recognized but not rewarded.

Awful Experience,1.0,"May 22, 2020",Nothing to mention because there was no pros for me.,"I am very highly educated in the field of Structural Engineering, which at that time thought to be a great help for this company. However, 1) The basis of this company stands on only production and not employee growth. There are numerous number of towers needed to be analyzed very fast (almost 2 hours each). Everything is pre-set for you to only put loads and run the spreadsheet and then create the report which is with only one click. This process which you are supposed to do it in 2 hours should be done every day, every month and so on. I have seen some people even with no structural engineering background which were employed there and were doing the same thing. Therefore, you wont be exposed to new challenges and learn more things and strengthen your knowledge and experience to enjoy as structural engineer. Since I was so bored of this job it effaced my health at that period. 2) Management is very awful. My weekly meetings with my manager were almost like a court trial answering questions about why I didn't finish 20 structures this week or why I had this many mistakes or etc. 3) Report reviewers were not consistent in their comments. They even modified their own comments after multiple rounds which I was shocked. Some of them really enjoyed seeing you fail. I resigned from that company and moved to another structural industry and now I feel very happy and successful as I am solving different challenges and very appreciated by this industry.

Some in management don’t even know the day to day activities of the trench crew. That’s disheartening because it seems they don’t care to know either. Do as I say not as I do. Transparency and collaboration are hugely lacking between middle management and subordinates. You’re essentially treated like you should shut up, keep your head down, and not ask questions or make recommendations or suggestions for improvements internally.

Penny Pay Produces Poor Performance,1.0,"Jun 29, 2014",The best part of American Tower is the day you walk out the door for good!,"I should have known better than to accept when I was offered my position and attempted to negotiate a minute pay increase. I was told, ""It's non-negotiable,"" which pretty much sums up working at American Tower. From the day I started until the day I left, they were concerned about numbers (as in more pay for upper management and horrible salaries from middle-management down). CEO Jim Taiclet earned more than $12 MILLION in 2013; Chief Financial Officer Tom Barlett earned more than $4.5 MILLION in 2013; President Steven Marshall earned more than $4.2 MILLION in 2013; Exec. VP William Hess earned more than $4 MILLION in 2013; and Exec. VP Edmund Disanto earned more than $3.8 MILLION in 2013. The company scrimps in regard to across-the-board company salaries - again for middle management and below - and tends to hire fresh-out-of-college graduates who will work for pennies on the dollar - only to leave at the first growth opportunity. As for customer service, I worked with great people, who cared about the industry and client goodwill; however, with the limited resources (as in too few people for too great a workload), staff just could not provide the ""premium"" level of service on which American Tower supposedly prides itself. It is a shame that American Tower does not understand the simple concept, ""You get what you pay for.""

Under Jim Taiclet, American Tower was the best employer in wireless with many spending decades here. When he left, Tom Bartlett stepped into that roll and the workplace has become toxic. I've never seen nor heard discrimination of any type here but now we are bombarded with social agenda. There is a constant harassment of employees with the pushing of LGBTQ agenda.

As a result, you spend a good amount of time each day emailing multiple different departments to get the information you need, and then they have to take the time of out of their workday to read information to you that's in a different system. New hires get a glazed-over look on their first day when they learn that their job will require them to learn 8 different systems, and that's not counting getting the correct access to them. Lease administration software is from the dark ages (that also includes the Excel spreadsheets that are still used). It shocks my senses to think how big we are as a real estate company and we are using software that I think I used back when I got my first Apple II computer. Have someone walk into the closest 5 office buildings from corporate headquarters and ask the property managers which lease administration software they use. I'm sure none of them use what we have. As for project management software, some departments use Footprints, which is really a ""help desk"" tool to help technicians diagnose problems like not having internet access. If you go to the Footprints website, it actually says this. Footprints is not meant for project management. I did a double-take when I learned about that, especially considering how many great project management tools there are out there. Using Footprints for project management is like a right-handed person cutting her lawn with dull lefty scissors. Those are just two examples of our systems. Not only are the IT tools horrible, but there is absolutely no data integrity at the company. You are told on your first day ""don't trust that any information or document is correct,"" Huh? You don't have people to routinely audit your data to make sure it is correct? You just leave incorrect data in the system so that the next person who looks at it will be tripped up by the same mistake? The scary thing is that many long-term employees (management and otherwise) have become so used to the dysfunction that they don't even see it any more. Their typical response is ""well, it used to be worse before."" That's like saying, ""Well, yes I drive a 1977 Ford Pinto with an exploding gas tank, but it's a heck of a lot nicer than my 1973 Ford Pinto with an exploding gas tank AND a rusty fender. At least this one doesn't have any rust."" Don't bother asking to get these systems fixed. When you do push to get something fixed, the usual response is that IT is so busy that it will take years to fix, it will cost too much money, etc. You would think that we would have top-notch systems considering that our building is bursting at the seams with IT people. At this rate, I think in 2 years we will have more IT people in the building than actual tower people. It puzzles me why a real estate company employs more IT people than Microsoft, and why we don't just ""simplify"" everything by outsourcing tasks that we are clearly not very good at. I really could go on forever, but the short of the long is that if you are used to a well-oiled machine when it comes to IT, American Tower may not be the place for you. You will be spending a good portion of your day dealing with these problems instead of focusing on your actual job.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

"Middle-management OK, upper-management and HR are ridiculous",4.0,"Mar 9, 2015","Fantastic business model -- they'll be around for a long time. Stable company in a fast-paced industry. My immediate supervisor was great. He was approachable, polite, and got things done. He was easy to work with for scheduling time off and didn't have an issue if we had to leave in the middle of the day to go run a personal errand, as long as we got our time in. In short, he treated his subordinates as humans; it was great to be appreciated. Time off: You start at 3 weeks of ""flex-time"" plus 3 ""floating holidays"" (due to the ""diverse corporate culture and holidays that might not be celebrated in all cultures"") so you essentially get 3.5 weeks off. You can borrow up to a week of flex time, but only one week carries over to the next year. After a few years you get a 4th week, and a few more years you get a 5th week off. I think you have to work there for 6 years to get that 5th week and then you've maxed out. Health insurance coverage: some of the best out there. When I was last there, it wasn't too expensive for amazing coverage for a family. This was my biggest regret after leaving. Pay: I was hourly and got as much overtime as I wanted.","HR is a joke and treats people like little children. Upper management is similar; they have silly fantasies of ""teams"" (even though everyone works quietly in cubes all day). Many of them don't seem to have any function other than micromanaging subordinates with daily Excel spreadsheets of productivity; they track each employee's production every day (at least on my team). Sick time is rolled into PTO under the guise of ""flex time"" so if you're sick for 3 weeks out of the year, you don't get any vacation unless you want to borrow flex time.

"If You Work in Engineering, Work Somewhere Else",2.0,"Oct 28, 2014","ATC has good benefits: RSUs, ESPP, 401(k), surprisingly good insurance, and I personally was paid well enough. Additionally, if you learn how to navigate the system (at least in Engineering), keep your head down, and don't make waves, you can wile away your 8 hours a day doing next to nothing.","I found the culture at ATC - at least on the Engineering side where I worked - demoralizing and oppressive. Though there were some decent individuals, in general, the management was incompetent, hesitating to make simple process changes that would have made life easier for rank and file employees for no other reason than that they didn't want to stick their necks out. Their incompetence, of course, made them insecure, and their insecurity made them oppressive, so in stark contrast to their feckless dithering when it came to improving process, the one arena in which they could act decisively was when silencing criticism. And as if the intra-group oppressiveness weren't enough, there was inter-departmental antagonism and mistrust aplenty. I personally saw emails where people in the Finance department did little more than point fingers at the Operations and Development teams, and I was involved in Operations trouble-shooting sessions where the express goal of the meeting was not to find the root cause of an incident but rather to find a way to absolve Operations by pinning responsibility on the Development team. In an atmosphere like this, an employee generally has three options: 1. Stop caring, keep one's head down, and do as little as possible. 2. Work the system and become as slimy an operator as the managers. For example, get yourself peripherally but non-essentially attached to as many projects as possible, then walk nonchalantly away from those projects that are bound for failure while associating yourself more closely with those projects that seem headed for success. Never take responsibility; always take credit. 3. Leave. If you take a job in the Engineering department of ATC, you can reasonably expect most of your colleagues to fit into one of those three groups, so if you are currently entertaining an offer from ATC and you aren't a slimy political operator, then I would sincerely advise you, as someone with no stake in your decision, to reflect soberly on your options before accepting their offer.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

Sales Culture Lacking,3.0,"Apr 17, 2020","American Tower is a very successful company in a line of business that should be rock solid for years to come.

Benefits are solid and there are good people at the company for the most part","The culture on the sales team can be demoralizing for a regular sales person in a number of ways. For a $110 Billion plus company it is jarring to hear that they cannot pay commissions on time consistently. Goal posts are moved all too often to the detriment of sales people so much so that the last 3 years there have been 5 or less sales people that have hit 100% of their goal (which is then celebrated as presidents club and a $50 gift card). Managers justify this holding to company line. Pay is already on the low end of the industry which is justified by the use of ""consultants"" that are brought in yearly to analyze pay. There has been a refrain from leadership through the years that our sales team doesn't have much of an impact on numbers (""we would have gotten that sale anyways"") which is demeaning to our work. On the one hand they use that to say that they don't need to pay market rate to their people, but on the other side they are always pushing our tiny sales team to come up with a constant stream of new ideas. Small sales team leads to minimal upward mobility. You don't start making real money until you hit a VP title (like 4 people) which are given out to ""the old boys club"" at ATC. Successes are not celebrated and managers goals are not aligned with their employees so you could have a manager who has a blowout year but one of his/her direct reports is often below 50% to goal.

"Houston, we have a (legal) problem!",1.0,"Oct 2, 2014","You can't beat the people at American Tower. Colleagues are nice, laid back and fun. Executive leadership is outstanding. Benefits are good, despite low pay. The legal department has a lot of very smart people and you can learn a lot from them. Our GC and many of the veteran lawyers are some of the best telecommunications lawyers in the country.","The numbers are all there. The turnover rate is ASTRONOMICAL. Employee survey results are dismal. Morale is low. At least half of the department is interviewing elsewhere, even grizzled veterans that are key performers. So why is this? To start off, it’s a combination of a high volume of work and lots of pressure, but that can be said about any attorney job. But then add in major office politics, poor management, no clear paths for advancement, confusing/contradictory/non-existent procedures, and horrible computer systems. Oh, and low pay as well. Yes, we know that HR has done ""studies"" of what lawyers get paid, but I'd rather trust surveys like the one Major, Lindsey and Africa did that says that the LOWEST paid attorneys in the telecom industry make $150,00 and the median total pay was $180,000. To get down to the nitty gritty, here are everyday experiences in the legal department: You work for a manager who has no idea how to do his/her job or how to help you do yours. You work overtime each week to crank out hundreds of documents on your drafting list and are the top performer on your team, but you get docked on your review and get a measly 3% raise because of some trivial thing that you did or forgot to do (like comply with one of our many unwritten procedures or say ""thank you"" in an email). You are a licensed attorney and handle your own UPS, FedEx, mail, copying and scanning when you could be writing contracts. Your manager tells you that you are behind in writing contracts. You have a major project due by the end of the week, but the company rolls out a new document storage system without testing it and you are locked out of your files. Our motto is to implement first, then actually give the project some thought after the fact, then say that we’re too invested in the current system to fix the problems, and then devise a hundred “workarounds” that make it more burdensome to do your job. We spend millions on bad systems and then tell everyone that raises were low because we have to keep SG&A down. You have asked several times what is needed to advance to the next level. You are either given no answer or you are given certain goals to meet, and when you meet them, they “move the chains” and say you didn’t meet other goals that no one told you about. Then the company will hire someone will less experience for a more senior position than yours. Your terrible manager has lost 75-100% of his/her team and still has both a management position and a job because the company can’t admit that some people can’t be fixed. There are hundreds of articles that talk about why bad managers can't be changed. Remember, employees don’t leave companies, they leave bosses! You are a great worker, but get so fed up with the pay/advancement that you find a new job. You speak with your manager and tell him/her that you have an offer, but you would stay if they bumped you up $5,000 in pay. They tell you that they wish you the best of luck in your new job. Yet, the average cost to replace an employee is 30% of her salary (in just recruiting and training costs), and that doesn't even count the loss of experience, loss of social connections, loss of morale to the department and so on.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

The core values the company ""exhibits"" are of face value only to maintain a corporate structure. Many have witnessed situations where one employee on a team is an issue and causes others to loose privileges and other benefits instead of holding the individual responsible. HR pushes things ""under the rug"" there are managers and employees who are never held accountable for their actions, lack of contribution, quality work, poor leadership, negativity and rudeness and even retaliation against people who stand up for themselves or try to involve HR over serious issues. Sadly a lot of issues go unreported due to fear of losing your job. The Corporate office in Boston is completely disconnected from other offices, decisions are made involving processes and procedures without cross-functional understanding which severely affect day to day operations. Data quality is extremely poor between the main office and other teams leaving others to ""clean up others work"" and told ""It is easier for you to fix than us"" Teams are often ""put down"" during conference calls by the VPs despite their continued hard work and effort to preserve the data quality and enhance customer experiences with the company.

Structural Engineer I,1.0,"Jul 18, 2015","The company offers generous PTO, a decent benefit package, the option to purchase stock, a wellness reimbursement, and the occasional team/company field trip as a thank you for all the hard work.","The nature of the work is basically that of a production environment. Work, work, work...pump out as many analyses as possible. Your production output is measured very closely in a spreadsheet that everyone can see. Most of the engineers are working with software that is not used in the consultant world...it is owned and used only by the company, which can hinder an individual's skill set. It is assumed the you are to spend your own time to learn what you would normally learn on the job anywhere else. So basically, you work in the production mill as the whip is is cracked and you learn pertinent information on your off time after all the overtime. For the time being, just plug away and make sure the production goal is met, and if it isn't...overtime will be required/suggested/implied....depending on how management wants to word it or employ fear tactics on the occasion. You will receive very short notice to complete certain assignments. I have witnessed it. And you will be pressured into doing whatever it takes to help the team. Many times, there are very unrealistic goals and management has a bunch of guys fresh out of college that will many times just do what they are told, without questioning anything, and more or less create a consensus and general acceptance of a workplace with low morale and long hours. Management takes this as the green light to establish this as a standard for every one to abide by. In other words, if someone else jumps off of a bridge, it will be expected for you to to do the same...very micromanaging and sad from a corporation that does nothing but speak of record highs and bright futures on every conference call and every meeting. At one point, the entire engineering department of very hard working and dedicated individuals, was required to work half of a day on employee appreciation day after it had been confirmed that we were to have the day off to enjoy a baseball game in appreciation for the sacrifices that many people make to their work-life balance for the business. The communique was sent out a few hours before end of business the previous day. What a great way to thank your employees. Too many layers. Takes forever to get decisions approved. A few individuals that have their head above the clouds and are company men to the fullest...good for them. Again, don't expect that to become the standard from everyone else. I have seen the guy that chases around management and is a yes-man, treating the guys above like gods and the people below him like peons, advance very quickly in this setting...poor judge of character on behalf of management. Strong leadership should embrace people who bring different ideas and speak up. Ladies and gentlemen, despite all of this and much of what was left out, the job is an ok starter opportunity, but after a while you will see that all that matters is production and squeezing every last dollars worth out ambitious young men and women. I hate to be the one leaving an overall bad review for a company that I have had higher hopes for from the start.

It didn't take long for me to figure out that IT was THE most hated group in the whole company and that my job was the definition of a Catch 22. On the one hand you have clients who have a laundry list of complaints about our systems. And who can blame them? The systems are an embarrassment for a company of that size. They're so bad that I would guess that they cost the average user 2 hours a day in lost productivity. But to make matters worse, you have an IT group that is in a state of denial. Their attitude is that users are a bunch of complainers. The motto is that ""the customer is always wrong,"" and you're not allowed to admit that there are any problems. It takes 10 mouse clicks to select ""OK"" in a program? That's within normal parameters. But we have a workaround where you only have to click 8 times. Problem solved. When IT does a project, we are told to help ""guide"" the customer about what they want, not the other way around. Listening to the customer is not in the vocabulary. It's our way or forget about getting anything done. I left because I was tired of being the bad guy. When I took the ""company"" position with customers, I got yelled at by them.

ATC Shared Service Center - Sec 44 Gurgaon,5.0,"Jun 25, 2018","I joined ATC Shared service center around four months back…before joining I wanted to make sure about the company…I discussed this with few of my close industry friends ..and all of them gave me good feedback. But I was bit apprehensive as I had worked though some of the biggest MNCs in IT industry. But since I joined here , I realize that it is one of the best decision in my corporate life. Some Pros in my view are: 1. First of all I found the culture here very open and transparent. Any issues can be discussed with manager or above directly. 2. Technologies in which teams are working here are latest and saleable in market...Experience matters 3. Every resource has the opportunity to interact directly with client which I found very rare in any other service based organization 4. Leadership has vision and clear roadmap for coming years. Regular visits of senior leadership including CEO, CIO and others..a clear indication that SSC is one of the growth pillar in ATC Global strategy. 5. ATC has presence across many countries in North America, Latin America, Europe and African continent. I have seen many technical people travelling to these countries for client exposure. 6. Growing focus on Trainings & Certifications 7. No bureaucracy 8. Location is very convenient due to nearby Huda City center for metro connectivity 9.

I am listing so that other member working in IT Industry do not suffer the way I did. This is specifically for their IT SSC in Sector 44 1. No Work Ethics: They may give you a good increment if there is a need for your skill, which will always be at this IT Center due to huge attrition. But since that day you will be an eye sore for two folks sitting in top management and as soon they get a cheaper replacement or a contractor, they will fire you. Vague Reasons such as ""Feedback from team is not good"" are given. There could be some folks who want to come to NCR from South India and this might seem a good option, but it is not. Mark my word, you will regret from Day1 2. Behavior by top management: There are couple of folks running this center and they are hard core religious and castists. For women, this best avoidable 3. Daily 9:30 AM sharp is punch in time, no matter how long you stayed last night. Punch in tallied in a manual copy maintained by guard. No WFH ever. No CAB facility. There are 7 CLs and there is also a KRA which measures how many CLs a person took as compared to his allocation. 3. No support whatsoever. Degrading behavior by onsite team. 4. All the positive reviews are posted by management. You can understand that by the tone and language of review.

I could groom myself as a professional at IT Center !,4.0,"Dec 27, 2019","You get support from all the corners. Ample of opportunities exist to enhance your skills by working on multiple tools and technologies. - Work involves deep diving into domain as well as technology. At the time of need, SME's are readily available to help you. - In any IT company you simply deliver projects after projects. Here, I got good understanding of how IT helps in running the business. This gives you an edge over any other IT professional. - Center is one of the market leaders in Delhi-NCR in niche technologies. - Best part of working here is getting quick global exposure. Business teams sit in multiple geographies (US, Europe, Africa, Brazil etc.). You enjoy working with people from different cultures and grow quickly. - You are encouraged to cross-skill yourself and one can't escape from regular trainings. - Both offshore and onsite managers focus on quality of work and invest time in clarifying technical issues and sharing best practices. - As long as you can manage your own work, no one bothers you. - Flexible work timings.",- No cab facility although metro is close by - Not a big brand in IT industry,American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

ATC IT Shared Services Center - Promise of Stability and Growth,5.0,"Sep 19, 2019","I have been working with ATC India IT Shared Services Centre, as Senior Member Technical Staff, for around 2 years. I am proud of being a part of this Fortune 500 company and I want to share my experience working with the organization, for others to read and reflect upon it. Pros: 1. You get immediate exposure to working with Global colleagues. Its a great learning experience and surely works well for your CV, If you have worked with clients or colleagues in multiple geographies. It makes you aware of their culture, helps you build your communication and makes you confident working successfully in a remote delivery model 2. If you love independence in your work, if you love space and opportunity in work you will like this place. I love it, since I have the freedom to suggest improvements and drive them on my own. I get full support. If you are used to working in an instruction led and rigid environment, you will call this place not having the best processes. 3. The technology stack is wide and employees are encouraged to cross-skill and work on multiple technology platforms. If you have a learnt new technology, you dont have to struggle or wait to get into a new project. You can try your hands on a small project or task in the new technology area while continuing with your primary deliveries. Its pretty difficult to get such ample and easy learning opportunities in other organizations and the leadership continuously encourages people to learn more, acquire new skills and stay hands on. There is no fear of being on bench, there is no blood shed over delivery, delivery process is matured, technology is up-to-date - I don't think I could ask for more. And yes, I would love to learn about one more organization where a Salesforce resource gets opportunity to learn mulesfot. A Manual Tester gets opportunity to work as a Product Business Analyst. And this happens here without any fuss. I haven't seen another place ( may be I haven't switched enough:)) where people get trained on a new technology within a month of their joining and seamlessly deployed into new projects. Yes, it needs people with self drive as well. I have seen many examples, where people have joined this organization with ZERO experience and walked out as veterans in just 2 years. There must be something the organization has to offer !! But if you are the lazy children of god, aspiring a 5-star training center in Mysore or Trivandrum to pamper you into training, this may not be the place for you. 4. Prior to joining ATC India SSC, I was working with a MNC where work from home was the norm and I was quite used to it. Here we dont have Work From Home policy. I was initially skeptical. I was like how would I survive without work from home ? Would I be able to manage my home along with work ?? Trust me, I never faced any challenge in last 18 months I have worked here. If I had a delivery to do and an urgent work at home, organization always supported me. Timings are flexible. Managers are understanding. Onsite colleagues are friendly. There are enough leaves ( and I mean it :)) in your balance. Here neither people nor policies are rigid, like most other places I have worked before. So life is easy and comfortable at ATC India SSC. 5. I had always worked for large IT organizations that used to be hierarchical. ATC India SSC has 150+ employees and structure is pretty flat. Most objective appraisal cycle. No bias. No discrimination. And I think organization is a way too generous while doling out bonus to employees. If you are an average performer, your 100% bonus is still assured. If you are a good performer you have potential to earn higher bonus. I would love to learn of another organization that is as generous if not more!! And In the end, I dont want to stress too much on the free snacks, munches that we enjoy, proximity to metro station, celebrations and festivities that we have in our lives here. We are actually going to get more in coming days !","1. ATC India SSC Doesn’t advertise like other captive centers or IT organizations. So many people are not aware of this company. One of the reasons, why I thought of sharing my experience here, while I am still working here. 2. Cafeteria : The center needs better food options in the cafeteria. struggle and search is on ! Thankfully if you walk out of the building and food options are in abundance. So this has not bothered me much. 3. We do not have 2000 people in the office. So many of us do not get the opportunity to do nothing and get comfortably lost in the crowd...each one us is being taken care of, being thought of, being talked to. So if I am the one who loves coming to office and walking out without anyone noticing my presence, If I hate attention, I am not going to like this place.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm
IT Shared Services centre - Not a good choice,2.0,"Mar 22, 2019",If you are looking to relax with good work life balance - join this company. Hike better compared to other Indian IT companies.,Not much learning after 1 year. Leadership is not flexible for work from home and makes it a point to monitor if employees are reaching office by time. Immediate manager is biased towards particular group of people and ignores others. Not much growth in terms of position/role. You will not get good company of colleagues here.

Refrain from joining Gurgaon Shared services centre sec-44,2.0,"Aug 29, 2019",pantry staff serving everything you ask at your desk.,"The shared service office is another example of how some individuals can practice dictatorship even in this era of flat hierarchy in IT. If you do not work according to the so called leadership which by the way comprises of two individuals in this centre ,they will not leave a single chance to jeopardize your carrier. If you manage to escape them , then your onsite counter parts might add to your misery during work. These so called technical managers are there since ages and are ignorant about how things work nowadays. Some of them are unaware of requirement gathering and might want you to develop code on ad-hoc basis /unclear requirements .These people would want you to slog hours there despite your finished work. My only suggestion would be not to join this shared service center as these guys first lure by saying we work on the latest tech stack like Java, Mulesoft , spring , hibernate and what not but the reality is far more different. These managers are often busy pleasing their onsite counter parts by different means so that center keeps on getting funding for their operations and hardly care for the employees well being and aspirations. To add on there is no wfh/flexi timings /cabs be it female or male employee/ career growth. You will get single digit annual increments saying telecom sector is not doing good after all year work. Opting as a full time employee under such a leadership is a big NO .In case you plan to join as a contractor, try not getting selected in the client interview and intentionally get rejected to save yourself.",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm

They allow little room for common human error and you are expected to anticipate even the 'unknowns' and have a plan. Every decision seems to be make or break and it creates a tense environment.

ATC IT SSC Sec 44 - A Nice experience one must have,4.0,"Oct 18, 2019","At the time of joining I had multiple offers and was in two minds whether to join ATC or not. Now after spending almost 6 months in this organization, I realized that refusing offer from ATC would have been a big mistake of my life. Here are some of the Pros : 1. My colleagues helped me in proper handover. Though documentation is not exhaustive but hand holding was amazing and I did not feel any stress et al to start delivering my work. 2. In my earlier organization (Before ATC IT SSC) I was working on the US project and almost 3-4 Days in a week I had to slog in the Nights for calls. Work Life balance is good and slogging is rare phenomenon. US colleagues are very accommodating to consider the time difference 3. I never worked on Weekends in last 6 months and leaves are plenty in numbers 4. Best thing is quality of work and hands on experience on niche technologies 5. Most of the work is done along with onsite colleagues and managers give free hand to the team. Senior Management is very friendly 6. International exposure is wonderful and even junior people get a chance to work with International colleagues. 7. I came from one of the Top 3 IT companies in India. But never find free biscuits/Chips/snacks on floor. It is always paid. But Here to my PLEASANT SURPRISE 2-3 types of biscuits / chips/peanuts…Buttermilk/Soups is all FREE…. 😊 and there are Evening SNACKS TOO …ALL Free 8.

Negative environment! Join at your own risk,1.0,"Sep 5, 2019","Well ! At least they provide good snacks . Just because of the supportive team members, i was able to stay there everyday.","I have a huge list but i am here to review so i should mention a few: 1. Zero care for employees: Well the people at the higher managament (only 2) do not care about what the employees going through. They just want every employee to say yes to everything. Biased towards one community. They will not even look at you if you are an average performer. 2. No job security:. The upper mgt has built an image such that all the lower level employees have to say yes to stay in the company. This creates a negative environment. The mgt is inclined towards one team and that team has all the privileges. I have seen employees being thrown out on minor issues. 3. No cultural diversity: Specifically in The Gurgaon IT captive centre, I have not seen any cultural diversity. In fact they reject the candidates in the first round of interview. They prefer candidates from one specific religion. No non- veg food allowed. I mean which company applies the restrictions on food. Dissapointed. 4. No HR support: The HR team does not respond to your queries unless escalated. 5. No training curriculum: They don't provide any internal training for career growth. If you want to just sit and do the same thing for the rest of your life. This company is for you. 6. No transparency between teams: All decisions are made without consulting the teams which have to do the ground work. Just directly publish the timelines for every deliverable and then to expect quality out of that. 7. Fake Image: The HR will ask you to fill a feedback form while exit and say this will be anonymous. But, in reality, that feedback is shown to the 'Upper' management and then they might ask you to change the feedback. Just to maintain the 'good image' outside. 8. High attrition rate: Every now and then, somebody would have resigned due to this negative environment. Now, they are going back to contractors for completing the deliverables. 9. Micro management: They keep track of the employees swipe in - out times and ask them to stay for 9 hours irrespective of the work load. There are many other points. In a nutshell, SSC is the worst work place you will ever come accross. All the positive reviews for this centre are fake.

Strictly Stay Away from Gurgaon IT Captive Center Unless this is the best u can manage!!!!,1.0,"Feb 12, 2018",1. You can have a good time here if you can strictly follow the office timings(9:30am-6pm) and do nothing at all. 2. You get monthly mobile bill reimbursement of 500rs and Rs. 10000 for mobile purchase once in 2 years. 3. There is no cafeteria or recreation zone but snack is served in evenings.,"1. High Risk of getting sacked without any logical reason. Your manager doesn't like you and that enough, you may be asked not to come to work the following day. 2. Lack of leadership and management. Top management involved in petty and laughable things. 3. Very poor work culture. Dirty politics. Completely unprofessional ways of handling situations and people. 4. Policies are bad and not as per IT standards. There is no work from home and flexibility. eg. you need to be in office at 9:30 am every day no matter how hard and late you work. 5. Its just Captive just by name, there is no growth/learning/onsite/certifications etc. 6. There is nothing for recreation or even a proper cafeteria or break out area. You have to rely on the street side food stalls for lunch/snack. 7. Senior managers do not have any foresight or vision, they care just about cost of snacks. 8. Contractors are treated worst than bonded labourers. 9. It a company running like a chemistry lab experiment, senior management will try different things without any logic or reason and go back to something else once it doesnt work",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm
Worst Company for IT people-ATC Shared Service Center,1.0,"Sep 16, 2019","1. Company provide free snacks in the evening 2. Average compensation, a SIM is provided, and bill is taken care of by ATC 3. Handset reimbursement in every 2 years (On an average 10k) 4. In some of the projects work is good but now days it’s like copy and paste from some other project which is already developed 5.Good hike for freshers (20-35%) based on the rating","1. Unrealistic deadlines in every project , onsite director believes that any project can be delivered within 5 days(1 week) , a big joke right ,for him it doesn't matter how big the project is , how complex the business logic is , how many flows are getting developed and even if you delivered it somehow working day and night ; project is not going to get deployed in UAT/Prod for next 1 year. 2. There follow literally no process (a big zero), adhoc changes will keep coming and delivery time is never going to increase, and they will blame you are you are able to deliver 2. Except few , most of the onsite counterparts who are leading the project believe in micromanagement ,even if they saw that , you are not online on skype (they are not going to see and think if it's lunch time in India) they will escalate it to the senior management and management here is going to blame you 3. Offshore managers have no powers; they are only there to blame you and for approving leaves 4. Management here doesn't believes in proving any facilities that are very much common in other IT companies like work from home , cab pick/drop in case on morning/night shifts or any female going late ,No Canteen facilities ; even if you want to drink a tea you will have to visit a thela wala 5. Below average infrastructure, it looks like you have entered a call centre instead of IT company and if you are sitting on the top floor, even AC's is not working and there is nobody to hear the same 6. Appraisals are worst for lateral hires , single digit hike .No transparency at all ,some people got around 15-20% hike as organisation was thinking that they will not leave the company but they are also leaving because of the situations here and rest were given a single digits hike 4-5% .I don't know why they are doing it because if somebody is getting 4-5% hike why he/she is going to join an organisation like ATC IT SSC instead on big corporates like TCS , Infosys etc. 7. 100% attrition rate every year 8.No projects in Java domain, they are hiring by saying that were working on Microservices, React JS etc but there is nothing like that. I will say they haven't started yet so please don't fall in the trap 9.Also entire QA team is working on manual testing; they don't even know the ""A"" of Automation. So, QA guys coming for hiring drive please be aware 10.Also they are not able to hire any employee on their payrolls so most of the employees are now from HCL and Tech Mahindra working as Contractors",American Tower Corporation,AMT,2025-11-11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Tower-Reviews-E8043.htm
