Free yourself,1.0,"Nov 12, 2025",Im not too sure what to say. Liked the manager and team but not the corporate structure.,"I was overworked and completely underpaid. I was expected to do more work than my coworker who constantly smoked on his breaks and also drank on his breaks. Management also had me as the only person completing weekly ""property walks"" around three buildings, no gas reimbursement or additional pay for the physical labor. When they state you receive a 30% discount as part of your benefits, do not get too excited, they tax your paycheck which equates to the total rent total online, which is very predatory behavior. After I asked for a raise, within 3 months- they got back to me and added an additional $0.23 on my hourly pay, which was a slap in the face. I'd also like to add that HB and Orange County is a very historically racist part of California. The way they treat the residents, is the exact way they will treat you as a worker.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

They are continuously looking for innovative ways to expand benefit packages for employees and expanding ideas on how they can bring more ease in a peace of mind to the employees as a whole.","They tend to make decisions about bringing in new policies fairly quickly as in the policy has already been implemented when you were receiving the training or the notification that we have something new coming, which can be a little bit stressful, especially if there are changes that affect residence at a property as a whole. It can be as simple as an email being sent out letting someone know that they are going to have a new charge on their next lease, and then you are bombarded with a bunch of people running into the office to complain whereas, realistically, if you are able to give people more of a heads up, it allows us time to be able to maul over the changes and find a way to give the proper verbiage to the residents.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

UDR - Horrible Work Culture & Hostile Environment,1.0,"Jul 2, 2023","Honestly, the only thing that I enjoyed about the company/my job was that there was a gym in the office building.","The culture at UDR is inimical. Employees are controlled with fear. The work environment is hostile. Many of my peers have disclosed to me and I have witnessed for myself the impact the job and the stress have on their health (mental and physical). One of my peers expressed to me that they would go to their car every day during their lunch and cry because they were so afraid of making a mistake. Another shared with me that they would throw up everyday before going into work because the workload was so overwhelming. There’s a difference between work that is challenging and a work load that is impossible. The work itself was difficult but doable. The work load on the other hand was so overwhelming. There were no safety nets to prepare the associates for the work load if there was any sort of emergency, such as a family emergency, personal health concerns, and/or the company deciding to let someone go—all of which occurred in my area during my employment. This resulted in the employees and myself being immensely overworked and over-stressed. Despite these examples being emergencies that were out of the hands of the employees, the pressure to be perfect remained. Despite having very good numbers during this time when my peers and I were overwhelmed with work, my work was constantly and harshly criticized. There was no grace, patience, or respect exhibited by the company when my coworkers and I worked excessive overtime to meet the demands of the high volume of work. The company is so ill equipped for their employees to have a 3 dimensional life. The work/life balance weighed aggressively in favor of work over life. On two occasions my manager (though indirectly, very clearly) threatened my employment as a way of controlling me as an associate.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

You can move to different cities with a job.",If you are a person that cares about the people who live in the property you manage you will not be happy. I've had to reduce courtesy patrol and not have non operational exterior light fixed because of budget. As the criminal activity in our property and the surrounding neighborhood increases. This as we raise rents without any operation cost increases. In the last 10 years they look down on people that start at the leasing agent level to move up. They feel that you have to much of a connection to people and you don't see everything as a dollar figure. The people that made UDR great are slowly being pushed out and replaced with employees that only look at thier residents as numbers. It's changing in all thier regions. So now they bring in area directors from other companies without experience in property management because their experience is focusing on the money. This is not about me it's just what I have seen if you have a 7 year tenure district manager that started as leasing agent been with the company for 15 years she was not qualified to be the area manager. So they brought in a VP's college friend that worked in finance.

Great company with a vision. Very frustrating industry. Company moving away from site associates.,4.0,"Jan 22, 2021","UDR has a solid culture built on the ideas of associate engagement, resident engagement, and winning the market. The competitive nature of a public REIT makes the job rewarding. Benefits were good and there are a lot of great people within the organization, both personally and professionally. They do promote from within, albeit sometimes not very fast. UDR has best in-class technology to perform the job. The best part of the job was the people and bonuses/commissions, although the commission structure was consistently in flux.","Multifamily in general is a rough environment for on-site associates. It can be draining emotionally and mentally, although you can be compensated well for this. The work-life balance for salaried managers can be improved as there is a ""always connected"" vibe floating in the culture. UDR is also very much pushing the needle in every way around the resident experience. They are investing so heavily in technology that site associates are starting to feel the pressure with less site associates (sometimes 1 for 150+ units). The pressure is so heavy to boost margins across the company that year-over-year there have been commission and position related cuts. I've seem many associates come and go over the years I was there. The business model has not changed drastically, but enough to systematically change who works at the company. They also refused to open the offices in Southern California due to COVID-19, well past the point necessary.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

They don’t care about their employees during COVID,1.0,"Dec 28, 2021",Employee benefit options are good,"This company has no valid reason for making the MAJORITY or their employees come into the corporate office during COVID. It’s as if all of the higher ups are sitting around just counting their money and ignoring the news of the transmissibility of this new variant. Also, it is known among employees that the company is spending a ridiculous amount of money to remodel their building while doing away with annual bonuses for the sales team (the people who bring in leases and generate revenue). Clearly the higher ups see this as fair, employee centric behavior but do not see that requiring people to come into the office to potentially get sick as a problem. Selfish much?? Most employees were MORE productive while working remotely but that has been ignored all because the old school top brass here insists that seeing people in the hallways promotes a happy team environment.

"The most greediest and money hungry property management company I have ever worked for.

The nearly whole year I was there, my property NEVER HAD AN ASSISTANT COMMUNITY DIRECTOR. Work load way too heavy - always worked over time(they demanded it but didn't want to pay for it) I was performing managerial type tasks with no extra pay. If you make too much money, you get on their radar as they don't budget for MAs to make more than $60k a year- In 6 months, I had two Community Directors in addition to a long stretch of NO manager whatsoever. Very little guidance, discrimination, and inexperienced managers are the norm. Audits go horrible due to these factors.

Not only has UDR provided me with foresight of the possibilities for myself and my peers, they have also developed the tools necessary to help me achieve my goals. This has made me not only a better technician, but a better person and professional. I now exceed at my job daily, and my confidence is at an all time high. Pair this with the amazing team members they have put into place, and what you have is the perfect formula for a positive experience in a booming industry.

They have an attitude to be the best. The company is innovative with technology and revenue growth. High expectations and beautiful communities. Great amount of resources. Opportunities within the company. They seem to acknowledge hard working associates. Pay is good- some reviews state the commission structure changed which is true. However, since the roll out of 1 month furnished leases this makes sense. You can still make 60K and this does not require sophisticated education/training. Housing discount is great.

From what I have gained, you pretty much go from Marketing Associate, to Assistant Community Director to Community Director. While each role has its new challenges, nothing is too diversified from one another. I would love to stick with the company, but I will most likely quit soon since 90% of the positions within the company are completely binary in nature, and lack the ability for one to provide creative thought to the company's success. There's no 'Big Days' that you would ever have a chance to prepare for, and you will most likely develop a strong case of on the job boredom.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

NO work life balance because you are constantly on call since the temp concierges are not properly trained. So you work off the clock and for free basically. Upper management NEVER listen to the onsite teams. They will ask you to stop what you are doing to please greedy Jerry (the president of the company who is retiring soon) and then ask why you did not finish your other tasks. Employee layoff galore so that Jerry can take home a bigger retirement bonus leaving the employees left swamped with unmeasurable tasks and unrealistic expectations to get them completed daily with so little staff. Some properties even share staff. Upper management is rude, not helpful, cause a low moral and always plays favorites. UDR is money hungry, does not care for it's employee's or residents, just looking to make a profit.

It's All About Your Manager...,4.0,"Jul 7, 2022","As with many jobs, your experience at UDR will mostly depend on your relationship with your manager. Even within the same city, I spoke with several Asst. Managers who had a great experience, and some that had a terrible experience based on who their manager was within the company. Take time to get to know your potential manager. It might be a good idea to ask if you can speak with anyone else that has been managed by them in the past? Your manager will be the person that you spend time with every single day, so they will be the largest influence on your experience at the company. If you find a great manager, you will enjoy your time at the company. Sadly, the opposite is also true and if you get unlucky and have a terrible manager, you will likely dread going to work every day.

A single employee will carry the load of at least three people, no matter which position you have. In the past ten years they have deliberately cut down on what used to be an adequate number of people, just to save the company money.","As an example, they had 3 or 4 maintenance persons at each site but now they are down to just one (or none!) at some properties and expect him to share his time with other sites if needed, leaving huge gaps in coverage. And that's the situation all across the board, with all of the other positions from leasing to management. It's very hard to take time off a result, and using sick time is frowned upon since some sites have just one person there.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

I truly enjoy coming to work every day. My job challenges me, enables me to learn and grow daily, and my peers and mentors (as a result of their leadership) are empowering me to make an impact even in their absence.

I believed it all and felt like a real chump when none of it came to pass. I didn't even have basic supplies to do my job. I've never worked anywhere that was this cheap. Certain Bellevue properties in particular are very dysfunctional. The training program should be called ""figure it out or fail"". No one has your back or is looking to see you succeed.

When a prospect comes for a tour and the leasing consultant can't take them on tour because its 1 person working in a 400 unit property that is not something the prospect overlooks.Lack of adequate staff and compensation trickles over to customer satisfaction.

UDR; an excellent place to work for determined and focused individuals.,5.0,"Apr 16, 2017","1. Amazing career advancement opportunities and personal/professional development potential. 2. Superior executive leadership (Tom Toomey, Jerry Davis, Warren Troupe, Harry Alcock) 3. Superior senior leadership within IT (Scott Wesson, Josh Erosky) 4. Clearly defined company goals, values, vision, strategy, and complete transparency from the top down 5. UDR continually invests in employee development (tuition reimbursement, management certification programs, company sponsored special guest speaker events, etc.) 6. UDR continually gives back to the community via special paid days off so employees can volunteer for causes such as Habitat for Humanity 7. Continual focus on product quality and operational efficiency 8. UDR's management is constantly evaluating opportunities and making decisions that have positive impact on their customers, shareholders, and employees. 9. A culture that breeds innovation, creativity, and friendships 10. Bleeding and Cutting Edge technology 11. Strong focus on employee retention 12. IT continually works WITH the business to identify areas of improvement vs waiting for the business to reach out to IT 13. If you work hard for them, they work hard for you. 14. Management listens to and trusts their employees. 15. Working at UDR, I was trusted and empowered to make decisions in every role I held, both as an individual contributor and as a leader. 16. Education and training opportunities were plentiful. The company offers a huge library of OLT that covers a wide range of topics including business, IT engineering and certifications, project management, leadership, soft skills development, and many others 17. UDR paid for my certifications, technology books, and paid me to attend multiple certification training courses as well as industry/job related conferences 18. I was encouraged to step outside of a static definition of my role and contribute in many other meaningful ways opening opportunities to learn other skills not normally acquired at the individual contributor level The list just goes on. :) I spent over 6 years working for UDR, and during my time there I witnessed the company go through tremendous growth. This was seen in both the individuals who invested in UDR, as well as UDR as a whole. UDR understands and naturally responds well to those who invest in the company. Whether you are a shareholder or an employee, the dividends are evident and steadily increase as the company improves. For employees, they realized dividends in the form of personal development, career growth, and opportunity. For shareholders, they experienced continual increases in their payouts as UDR's portfolio and business model matured. UDR's business model is sound and is designed to weather the ups and downs of the rental market through diversification of their portfolio, assets, and market footprint. During my time there, I witnessed continual growth in the careers of those around me who invested in UDR's success. Even in my own career. I started out as an engineer and within a few short years and multiple promotions later; I was leading a group of very talented network, infrastructure, and security engineers. UDR's leadership is continually looking for ways to improve the quality of the work environment, and for new ways of investing in their employees. If you do not believe me, ask Tom Toomey or Scott Wesson yourself. I have personally witnessed on multiple occasions the senior leadership team speaking to the importance of spending time with your family, and maintaining the critical balance between home and work life. I had the pleasure of reporting to multiple managers during my time at UDR. Some might consider this a con; however, I learned important leadership skills through that process. This was due to the difference in management styles and approaches of each manager to whom I reported. As a technologist, one of the most important elements of your role at any company is the continued focus on new and emerging technologies. No engineer wishes to find himself or herself in a stagnant environment only to go around dusting off the same old technology day after day. I cannot divulge the actual technologies being used at UDR, but what I can tell you is UDR is focuses on technologies that continually enable and empower the business to grow. In many cases, this means you are working with the technologies that are cutting edge, and in some cases bleeding edge. I have found that UDR in certain cases was the first to adopt and prove out certain technologies. Speaking specifically about IT, Scott Wesson does not run the department like your normal run of the mill IT department. In most cases, IT departments are cost centers. Scott Wesson has a vast amount of experience in both technical leadership and operational leadership and he most certainly uses the fusion of that knowledge to the business's advantage. Scott not only invests in his leaders, he empowers them to run their teams and make decisions. Work for Scott was probably the single most valuable experience I had during my entire six years there. I learned so much about the business and how to think in ways that improve the business with technology, and not just the silo'd process I may be focusing on. If you are planning to join the UDR team, be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. UDR focuses on streamlined quality. Regarding employee retention, some companies choose to cut employees when a department changes direction causing certain roles to become redundant. I have first-hand witnessed this at UDR, and the first response was always ""what is this person's goals, and how can we help them achieve those goals by leveraging their skills and drive in a different role."" An example of this is at one point the IT group created a telecom department to gain greater efficiency in the management of telecom services. After a period of time, the process was streamlined and there was no longer a need for the number of individuals in that department. UDR is responsible for making decisions that are in favor of both their employees and shareholders, so instead of doing what many other companies do UDR worked with the individuals in that group directly and moved them into different roles within the department that matched the employee’s interests and the department's needs. Leadership definitely values the input of their employees. I had the opportunity to see many of my suggestions/recommendations recognized and implemented. I strongly recommend the team at UDR, and more specifically the leadership (Scott Wesson). I have learned more working under Scott than anyone else in my career thus far. It was the way he led the team by allowing them (us) to make empowered decisions, and more importantly, allowing them (us) to fall, dust ourselves off, and try again. I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure at UDR. The reason I left UDR was to focus on furthering my career in the field of Cyber Security, and I would absolutely jump at the opportunity to work at or with UDR at any juncture in the future should our paths cross again. This goes for the people I worked with there as well. UDR has always done right by me and their employees, and for that if UDR or anyone at UDR ever called or emailed me for assistance, I would always welcome that opportunity without hesitation.","I am a very transparent person, and I find value in good feedback. >Short-Term Issue (Solution in the works as of my last day there)< Though this is actively being resolved, I feel as though I need to mention it for complete transparency. The biggest downside of working in the IT department specifically was the office space in which IT resides. The area was very dark without much natural light, and was too small for the team that is there currently. There is a solution road-mapped for this, and the IT department will be moving to a new area of the building within the year. :) The feedback from the team concluded that the project manager (not in IT) who was in charge of the initial build out of the IT area did not request feedback from the IT team before making space decisions. Fortunately, the IT management team got involved in the process and established a cross-departmental committee to discuss current challenges and make decisions for the next space in which IT will be moving to within a year's time. This solution not only broke down the barriers between the project management team external to the IT group and the IT team, but it showed that the management team is committed to the employees and is willing to do what is necessary to solve challenges for them.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

At the end of the day the residents are the reason your there, however this company does not get it.","My entire work experience has been an unpleasant one. The management at my location talked down about all other employes almost daily, calling them dumb, and basically incompetent of doing anything which in turn brought the moral down. The condition of the homes are not up to par, and it seems as if it's not a priority. I was told on more then one occasion to just lie to the residents, rather then the issues being addressed.

More Growth=Lower Hapiness,2.0,"Dec 23, 2016","Unfortunately, due to many horrible experiences within the company I can not comment on too many pros.... When I first started with UDR, I LOVED it! I truly enjoyed going to work every day and was excited about the future opportunities that were available at the company. There are a lot of opportunities for growth! Now with any job, your boss will make or break the experience. I was very fortunate to have a wonderful manager during my initial employment with UDR. They helped develop my career and I truly felt that they cared about my growth and who I was. Looking back on it, I would have to say that my manager masked me from a lot of the bad in the beginning and made work fun.","I don't know where to start... and the easiest thing will probably be to make a list: 1) Corporate politics - If you do not enjoy any type of corporate politics, STAY AWAY. It's everywhere you turn! People receiving special treatment because of the ""relationship"" they have with certain people. I can also GUARANTEE you that if the wrong person does not ""like"" you (I mean just personally, nothing to even do with your work) they will make sure to make your life a living hell so that you will quit. They won't fire you because they have no valid reasons, but they will make sure you are so miserable that you'll walk out feeling defeated. I've watch this happen multiple times over. 2) Number focused and do not care how you achieve them - UDR has a tendency of rewarding bad behavior. They run contests regularly with a bonus being a reward. There are lots of low moral people working at the company who would violate laws and regulations just to produce these numbers and win the rewards. For someone who is consistently doing their job, don't expect to get anything. You have NO chance to win anything since your numbers will always remain stable and most contests are based on improvement of numbers. 3) Incompetent employees - There are a lot of big headed, incompetent employees in the wrong positions. People are promoted based on numbers. Doesn't matter if you produced the results the correct way, or ""wrong"" ways. I knew numerous employees that violate fair housing laws who are promoted for ""producing"" numbers. What happens when they get promoted to a managerial positions? New employees violating laws because that's what they were taught and don't know any better. Those are the major cons.. there are quite a bit more but I will stop here....","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

"Lack of Growth, Large Corporation Does Not Care About YOU, Daily Stress",1.0,"Jan 11, 2019","- Rent discount (30% off) -Small Commission for renting reserved parking & adding pets to leases -On-site staff usually tries the best they can with the little resources allocated for them (lack of resident funds for events, small staff at large properties, etc.)","From the beginning there was minimal training, multiple RSC's started and quit within my year of employment. The on-site team worked numerous weeks of overtime yet we were frequently discouraged and scolded from working so much. However, when you have a small staff and 5000+ residents to handle (upper management rarely steps in to help), it was impossible not to work extra hours. There is NO work to life balance. At. All. There was heavy favoritism from upper management. This made it extremely difficult for employees to grow within the company (though UDR will try to convince you otherwise). Gossip and lies spread rampantly amongst employees, furthering the favoritism to those who lingered in our superior's office cracking jokes, avoiding work and talking behind coworker's backs. UDR also does not prioritize their residents (unless you work for a luxury property), making it extremely difficult to enjoy working when residents constantly complain and berate you for the lack of funds or attention from the corporate office. Also, do not expect weekends off as they are the busiest time for leasing.

They do tend to nickel and dime customers which can make customer service difficult. They are innovative and competitive which is also listed in my Pros, but almost to the extreme. The real con comes with the lack of culture and cold business practices California. There has been massive turn over at the Regional and Site Level due to leadership practices. There really is no heart in Southern California and they are finding it difficult to hold on to good associates. This is an expensive and short-sighted strategy. There is little to no work-life balance and your job at UDR would be to impress the most senior leadership during every interaction repeatedly or you will find yourself ostracized and marginalized. Fear and intimation and sometimes downright illegal behaviors are practiced by those at Senior levels. All terminations at the management and regional level besides 1 have been voluntary in 2017.

Fantastic co-workers but management does not care about the residents or their happiness,1.0,"Jan 13, 2014",I truly enjoyed my co-workers and as a team we strove diligently to uphold the virtues of the company. Interacting with the residents of our property was also a highlight of my job as it enabled me to flourish as a customer service representative.,"Unfortunately, the management of the company, in particular the property manager and her supervisor, did not always seem to have their clients best interests in mind. They would blame the residents for things such as trash removal instead of focusing on solutions that would work in the residents' best interests, such as obtaining larger trash receptacles or hiring a waste management company whose pick-up schedule was more conducive to the property's needs. This has lead to decreased satisfaction in UDR properties as the senior management does not allot enough help and time to its service team or contractors in order to keep the properties in good condition. The property manager in particular would often waste hours a day bringing employees into her office one by one to pick-them-apart, many a time resulting in causing the employees to cry, instead of hosting group meetings in which the team could brainstorm and work together. This attitude caused dissent and unneeded stress to arise out of the team, which lead to several beneficial team members to leave. The company also has a ridiculous policy on their rent discount, which while you are working their is incredible. However, if you have to leave the company, they do not even give you the option of paying the non-discounted amount and instead give you a 5 day period to completely move-out of your apartment.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

Not what it used to be...,1.0,"Jul 29, 2022","The pay was decent, but not worth the overwhelming stress.","Everything else. *Most properties are equipped with minimal staff; one person in the office, one person in maintenance. Multi-tasking is one thing; multi-jobbing is something else. My area's management was delusional. She thought ""remote coverage"" from other properties was the answer to everything when people need time off. That isn't ""helping out"". That's literally doing someone else's job, plus yours (and getting paid for one). She calls people negative when the requested feedback doesn't fit her own perception. *Additionally, you're relying on the corporate office (Denver) to handle all leasing and renewals... online. Yet when prospects/residents can't get in touch with anyone (because quantity > quality), they call and/or visit the office non-stop with questions you can't answer. *Effective training doesn't exist, so even if you are ""able"" to do something you will probably lack the how-to. You're being trained by that same ""staff"" of one, so when there's endless phone/office traffic (daily), training is delayed. The entire job is basically learn-as-you-go. *When I finally did get a new local manager, a week later she pulled me aside: ""You're not crazy. I've been in this business 20 years and never seen anything like it. This is not normal."" She lasted 6 weeks, and gave her notice a week after mine. *Oh, and their Early Termination policy is illegal, but I guess the legal team found clever word play to get around that. You're also a human punching bag when maintenance requests take ""too long"" and people call/visit the office for updates to complain. At the property where I was, there are 328 units and one person servicing them. The only appliance that's considered an emergency is the fridge. So if you can't wash your clothes for 2-3 weeks, too bad. But if your rent is more than 1 day late (or withheld), you're slammed with a late fee that won't be waived.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm
Con Company,1.0,"Oct 28, 2012",Great co-workers in leasing office. That's it.,"It started off great when I started in 2008 as a maintenance tech. I was at a nice property with 2 other techs and was on call every 3rd week. Good pay, good benefits, and good bonuses. Then starting in 2010 they changed the maintenance operation to where half of the service teams had to drive all over the city 30 miles + to go to other properties to do work, short staffed every property to ONE tech onsite. One tech can NOT handle a 300 unit property and all the maintenance it needs. So after I was put at a middle size property alone, I was able to keep up work orders and large problems but could never get to the grounds, pools, etc. Despite not having enough time to maintain my property I was told to spend half a day there, then half at a sister property that was larger to help catch up. Was forced to take on call for 2 properties, then asked to cover for an ADDITIONAL 2 properties when they hired inexperienced workers. Bonuses stopped for everyone unless it came from surveys done by residents once a year. Yearly raises were 1-2% if you were a hard worker. Constantly being told, just be happy you have a job. During a town hall conference call, we were told that because the housing market is bad right now people will be loosing their houses and we are going to raise market rents to take advantage of the increase in people looking. They don't supply service techs with the parts they need and will use old scrap parts to try and patch things.

Disconnected with Property Management 101,1.0,"Jan 9, 2013","The benefits are decent, including discounted stock purchase giving you a feeling of ownership towards your results and job. My fellow co-workers were amazing people. UDR seeks to deploy technology that provides fast access to the resources you need and frees up time to focus on core job responsibilities.","Regional competitions were held that only focus on the number of leases and renewals, rather than percentages. This left only the large sites to always win and the smaller sites losing competitively and financially. It was also disappointing the winners got their prizes regardless of the prospect actually moving in or renewal actually starting. Site visits focus on reports with little time spent on the property. Site visits should facilitate training and mentoring, and serve as a check and balance system. It should allow the regional to view the property for improvement needed. Instead, onsite teams beg for the things that are needed without regionals viewing the problems. I experienced no in-person training but had online training that I was not given time in the office to complete, yet received emails that they need to be completed, leaving me to complete the training at home on my own time. I had no problem with this, except we were told there could be disciplinary action for donating time to the company; and I feared for my job should they discover this was completed on my days off. Due to the structure of positions on-site (no Assistant Managers), advancement seems impossible. Many numerical reports are prepared at the site level, but there’s no actual conversation about what’s really going on in the market, at the property, etc. I was at first supportive of a commission structure that was based on occupancy as it held everyone accountable and made me look at the business aspect. But, when upper management is not accountable for hindering your abilities to rent/renew, then you’re also stuck with the reduced pay and they gain the reduced expense. There is no company culture or sense of branding. Not once did I feel a part of UDR, just part of a property. I have no idea who anyone is in senior management other than who I had to send emails too or what I found out through my own online research.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm

Potential to grow and relocate anywhere in the US.",The property managers at many of the properties from my experience are not at all professional or experienced. It all just depends on your property and the area you're in. Onsite managers do NOT train at all -- they throw you in and expect you to do a lot of what they are supposed to be doing. Depending on the area the pay scale is not so great.

"Good for an ""in between"" job, not promising for a career",2.0,"May 2, 2011","UDR has a good training plan implemented through the corporate office. You will probably attend 2-3 of these classes a year which helps keep your daily duties relevant. They are pretty flexible in getting time off, good benefits, and overall, everyone knows how to have a good time at work as well as outside of work.","There is a lack of communication from upper management regarding what works on a property and what they want to see implemented. The Denver office is really good at creating new business practices for everyone to follow, but horrible at researching what will actually be effective on a property. UDR will tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door and then forget about you. During the interview process, I was told that I would move up in the company within 6 months and have another big promotion most likely within a year. Needless to say, this has not happened and I was considered ""lucky"" to receive only a 1% raise...far from the several different types of bonuses that I was promised. I guess this raise was meritted after my job duties increased tenfold and I was not being compensated for these new dutiesI did not sign up for. When explaining my job role, I tell people I do just about everything, as that is what I do The level of professionalism at UDR is below subpar. Employees are not treated the same or with respect. HR does a horrible job addressing serious complaints, which in the end, could cost them. Everything revloves around the bottom dollar and what is best for the company, not its employees. UDR would rather hire new employees at a cheaper rate than address the issues of its hard working employees that have been with the company for years. Considering the industry, they should know that in retrospect, it is cheaper to keep a current employee than to hire a new one. Working for UDR will give you relevant industry experience and build your resume, but that is about it.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm
,2.0,"Sep 23, 2010",Opportunities to telecommute. The people below upper management are easy to work with. Business casual dress code. Convenient office locations.,No promotion structure.

United Dominion Realty Trust... not for everyone,1.0,"Oct 5, 2010","I would have to say that there are no real benefits to working for UDRT specifically, however, getting into property management in general can be a good thing for some people. If you are outgoing, love working closely with people, are good in sales and customer service, then this might be right up your alley. Without a college degree, property managers can earn $40-$70k a year, and that's pretty impressive when you consider other positions and the length of time it would take to climb the corporate ladder without a BA. This is what initially attracted me to the industry, as I was in the process of finishing my degree. If you don't mind working weekends, and sometimes long, unpredictably chaotic days, this is a good job for someone fresh out of school that wants a broad range of work experience quickly. Though I've never met many recent graduates that stayed in the industry long, I have seen several of my peers (all men whom recently graduated from VA colleges) quickly rise to the ranks of upper management, seeing sizable promotions with little or no effort on their part. So I would highly recommend this line of work if you see yourself in this capacity. In addition, I would try employment with a company that is not a REIT (real estate investment trust). REITS are pretty much beholden to a group of shareholders (that most likely have never visited your property and could care less about what occurs there as long as a profit is being made year over year according to their statements). You will find better pay, better property budgets, and generally better care of the residents at your community if you seek a management company that is an LLC, fee managed, or privately owned.","Property management in general is pretty thankless most of the time. You usually only ""hear"" from residents if they are unhappy, so I would say that one of the best experiences you can have is turning around a community of displeased customers by consistently proving that you'll go the extra mile for them. Companies like UDRT are notoriously unconcerned about customer service until it affects their bottom-line. Don't expect the focus of your job to be anything but revenue growth in the eyes of upper management. This makes it quite difficult to satisfy the masses while you're raising their rents through the roof. But on those rare occasions where you find yourself meeting absurd financial goals-- while simultaneously sump-pumping a flooded apartment, you realize that making a positive impact in people's lives might just be enough to offset the 90% negativity you encounter on other days. Being a dedicated manager might make you a personal hero in the eyes of traumatized tenants who wake at 2am to find their possessions floating around them, but reality sets in when those same tenants arrive at your office the next day for some kind of monetary compensation for their property loss, etc and all you can offer them are excessive apologies. UDRT will do everything in their power to avoid responsibility, or in the least will expect you to diplomatically diffuse these crisis situations, offering little in the way of compensation save a few pizza coupons. I remember almost losing my job when I made arrangements for a family to relocate to a local hotel after their apartment caught fire from an electrical anomaly. How often is it that one is reprimanded for putting people first instead of the almighty dollar? This was my realization that UDRT was the company I wanted to represent.","UDR, Inc.",UDR,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/UDR-Reviews-E1988.htm
