Don't work here if you like a work/life balance,1.0,"Jan 8, 2025",Getting to see great shows.,"The Grand Ole Opry still operates like it's 50+ years ago. Half the staff is at retirement age and still drilling old corporate policies that no longer apply today with no interest in new ideas. There is no work/life balance, 50+ hour weeks and still getting work calls on my days off. If you work a 13+ hour show day until 1am you're expected to come into a windowless office the next day for a full 8+ hours instead of resting. There's no work from home policies, and everyone in the office is extremely toxic. The years of bad management and psychology towards one another feeds like a succubus and there's constant finger pointing and snapping instead of solutions. The list goes on, but this company is very good at selling something that isn't true. Worst place I've ever worked at in my entire career. To Collin Reed and all the old men/women in the Ryman hightower, what are you going to do when all the retirement age folks leave, and you can't fill positions because of your outdated policies? You will have a very hard time hiring and will have constant turnover from the younger generations coming in.

"Should have taken these other reviews as warning. Single parents, listen up.",1.0,"Jun 1, 2023","The wonderful history within the Ryman and the Grand Ole Opry. Saying that you work for either of them always garners impressive comments from others. But that don't pay the bills. Pay is okay, but not for the amount of unneeded stress you'll endure.","HR department is terrified of communicating with anyone who's not ""top-floor"". Highly tout ""hybrid, flexible workplace"" when interviewing, but please don't be fooled. You'll get one day WFH/week at best, and they make you feel bad about it. The corporate office is more cliquey and catty than a teen movie. The amount of bickering that goes on between leadership roles over the dumbest projects and deadlines is laughable. If they'd spend half of the energy expended on that (or the inane team-building exercises you're forced to endure) lord knows what kind of heights this company would be taken to... And it's not like the company is doing terribly - they're rich as balls and like to tell you about it, as if it's also in your bank account as well. ""Hey everybody, come see how good I look!"" As I said, single parents - listen up. I'm a single father of 2 very young children, and from the day that I was hired, I was up-front in communicating that I needed to make full use of their so-called flex-time and remote policies, as there are times where I have no control over what time I need to leave the office in order to pick up my kids on-time. I was CONSTANTLY bullied by my direct supervisor over this, requesting that I submit my arrival/departure schedule to her WEEKLY for approval, though it never changed. Well, that wasn't going to happen. I was terminated because of this, and it's wrong on so many levels. Mental health is not a concern for leadership or HR. If you disclose you have a problem and need help, they will single you out. Also, get ready for all of the most cliché meme-worthy moments possible in a corporate setting. Pizza parties to celebrate record earnings in Q1! Teambuilding exercises at an escape room. All the gaslighting you can take. Take heed and go elsewhere. This place doesn't have the legacy of any of these historic brands they manage in mind, just how much they can earn. I get it, we're all in business for money, but take care of your people. Lastly - Diversity & Inclusion is touted as a top priority in this organization, but it's laughable. It all comes down to making sure there's a token person of color in all marketing materials, that's about it.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

I spent many hours explaining to VP level employees how marketing within the concert industry works, which as a professional who would still like to learn, was defeating. The workload assigned and expected from corporate marketing is unmanageable, and when you do express being overwhelmed you'll be told to suck it up. Don't let the shiny factor of the experiences distract you from very toxic culture present. It is not worth it. If you try to defend yourself, you'll be told you're not a ""team player.""

You often feel like you're spread too thin and aren't supported, which causes stress. The company operates on a feast-or-famine mentality. It's willing to spend on big projects that could be better researched beforehand while employees don't have access to proper tools to maximize efficiency. Wages aren't as competitive as you'd expect to see unless you hold a C-Suite job title.

The Peter Principle At Work,2.0,"Feb 7, 2019","The company has some great benefits for full-time team members (health, dental, + vision with a very reasonable employee contribution, a 401k with a 4% match vested immediately) and they rely very heavily on their long-standing reputation as meccas within the entertainment industry. They talk all the time about how cool it is to work there because of the Ryman Auditorium and the Grand Ole Opry, and depending on your role, you will get to interface with some great music business connections, as well as go to some fun destinations along with the hotel properties they own and new Ole Red restaurant chain. If you work in the corporate building, you have access to some perks such as $4 lunch in the cafeteria on Tuesdays and Thursdays, a gym, Crossfit and Yoga classes, and if you are at a certain level within the company, you can request tickets in the suite at Bridgestone Arena for concerts, events, and Predators games.","The company has an internal identity that is completely at odds with the actual working experience. HR and C-Suite level team members talk all the time about the great culture and how cool it is to work there, but the culture is very condescending, mainly held as a standard for front line and hourly employees while salaried and senior leaders are not held equally accountable and are not well versed in the culture themselves. The culture on paper looks good at first glance, but upon a little closer observation, you realize it's just leftovers from the days when the company operated the hotel, and most leaders couldn't tell you the Vision Statement if their life depended on it, let alone the other components of the aspirational, cartoony fluff being passed off as core to the company's values. Speaking of Salaried and Hourly Employees... the pay is good if you are an exempt team member, but if you are hourly you have to fight for every cent you have. There is no consistent policy for team outings (birthday lunches- am I expected to participate as a volunteer or stay on the clock?), and in general the pay is less than what you can make elsewhere in Nashville. There are lots of leaders that are holdovers from the Gaylord days, and many of them have risen to a level in the organization that is completely beyond their capabilities and skillsets. As a result, many of these mid- to high level leaders work constantly (several of my leaders have sent me emails at 3am and no, they aren't working the entertainment shows on these nights) in order to try to outpace their inadequacy and inability to delegate properly. There is a culture that you have to give everything to work, which would be one thing if people worked well together. On the contrary, the organization is extremely disconnected, with each team operating as its own silo, and communication is abysmal, with lots of duplicate work because the culture does not encourage sharing of resources and knowledge. There is no regular feedback process for team members to go through to voice concerns and frustrations other than going directly to HR, who rarely make an effort to correct the situation. The only real time an employee can voluntarily voice feedback is when leaving the company, and then the HR team discounts the perspectives as disgruntled employees. When feedback is done, it is in the form of handpicking team members to talk to the CEO so that he gets a very sanitized view of the perception within the organization. Voluntary development tools are also lacking; leaders are expected to attend mandatory training periodically, but there is no accountability if a leader decides not to participate. They only offer tuition reimbursement on college degree programs, so if you want to get a certificate or other training that would positively impact your abilities in your role, it is dependent on if your leader is willing to part with a few dollars from their budget (precious few leaders see the value in this). Most disturbing is the fact that all the C-suite leaders have surrounded themselves with yes men. Anytime an executive changes direction or priority, the whole team is expected to jump up and immediately get to work on the passion project du jour. The leaders can get ugly and aggressive in meetings and lash out at team members, but there is no culture of open dialogue and feedback, so rather than having a heated but open conversation on the goals and direction of strategy, mid-level leaders kowtow to this behavior, come back to their teams, and have truly unreasonable expectations for the team members to then meet these new deadlines and project achievements. There is no solid priority set for the future, so the minute a C-suite leader makes an offhanded comment about one area, everyone jumps to make a difference in that business area (think of rats skittering from side to side on a ship). This means that when new leadership is brought in, the selection process is very short sited or expectations are grandiose (we've had 3 new CMOs in 2 years, and multiple people are starting to count on 2 hands the number of bosses they've reported to in the same time period). Some leaders overstep their bounds to assert their dominance on areas of the business they shouldn't be involved in; meanwhile, other leaders don't hold their team accountable.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm

It happened multiple times during my years with the company. Often times, the restructures were not well thought out and caused more issues than anything, which eventually lead to more restructuring. Depending on the position, there isn't a great work-life balance. Corporate is very political. The Opry will always be the ""golden child"". As a whole, the company will talk about all the growth potential, but realistically, the opportunities for promotions are few and far between.

Dream Job Turned Nightmare,1.0,"Mar 15, 2019","Decent health benefits, 401 k (match up to 4%), PTO accrual, options to attend shows that are not selling well.","I do not recommend this place to anyone. In fact, at this point I feel major guilt when we interview/hire amazing candidates because I know their talents are going to be wasted coming in here. RHP claims to want to be hiring ""experts in their fields"" but really they only want yes-men that will jump when C-Suite (or the select few individuals that hold tremendous amounts of power) says “jump”. Between constantly sticking up for your work (your manager/director will not) through a spider web of red-tape and approvals, and the horrendous work-life balance you will quickly burn-out. But that's okay! There are members of C-Suite that have been on record saying they want younger employees that they can pay less and work harder. Unfortunately, that's probably why we are sitting at a 50%+ turnover rate. Many members of my team (and I know to be true of other departments in the organization) have attempted to go to their leaders and tell them that things are not working, and we need to come together and find ways to fix things or we are going to see a lot of people leave. These conversations are all met the same way with harsh defenses and ""your feelings are incorrect"". Feedback given to the HR team is swept under the rug.

"Antiquated at best, Regressive at worst",1.0,"Mar 7, 2019","Great benefits including $4 lunches on Tuesdays and Thursdays, comprehensive healthcare plans, cross fit and yoga if desired on certain days and Rally Rewards with up to $200 gift cards if you participate. Occasionally, we have a farmers market that showcases local produce and vendors.","This company suffers from poor leadership from the top down. The CEO surrounds himself with ""yes men"" who reinforce his outlook and priorities. At one point, one of our weaker business ventures had been poorly performing for months and the CEO became aware of this last, mostly due to no one telling him about the failure. Other C-suites remain out of touch regarding day to day tasks and responsibilities of their team but remain mercurial. When they do decide to jump in and work with the team, they cause more confusion in their effort to catch up on the business. When it becomes apparent that the leadership is out of the loop, has not read emails, etc, they become defensive or act out. Poor leadership at this company has created a company culture where employees (who are trained adults and experts in their fields) have zero autonomy or authority in their work --- everything is second guessed after the fact and minute details that don't jive with the absent c-suites are deemed as ""big misses"" and projects grind to a screeching halt over elements that are not business impacting or revenue driving. This company does not reinvest in their employees encouraging additional training, certificates, conferences, etc. Many employees at Managerial levels have simply stayed with the company for a decade (sometimes starting on the Hotel side) and have been systematically promoted/rewarded regardless of their competence or skill set that best suits the role. Perhaps most alarming, feedback given to HR is met with blank stares as if a robot received a programming error. Recently, the company decided to offer vacation accrual (because prior, no vacation was offered for an employee's first year). HR presented this change like some grand innovation when really, this is the bare minimum offered by companies country-wide. It's like someone getting the iPhone 3 and being really impressed with the new technology and having no clue that they're 7 generations behind. Another contradiction, the company maintains that they are the leader in entertainment and want to remain competitive in the space. Everyone I have spoken to at this company has admitted they took a significant pay cut to work for RHP. This is concerning considering the CEO gets a significant bonus (rumored to be in the millions) every year.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm
Be Careful!,1.0,"Sep 11, 2018","- The people, all of the employees not beholden to the corporate structure are incredible people. - The benefits. If you happen to find a way into one of the minimally available full time positions the benefits are fantastic.","You know how people joke about evil corporations? Ryman HP may just be the example to take a look at. They have a stranglehold on the hospitality industry in the Nashville area so wages are stagnant. They tend to lead their most hopeful employees on with a carrot on a stick when it comes to moving up-- they talk up their ""growth potential"", but there aren't the positions available anywhere within. How is it that a company so proud to reach the coveted title of ""Billion dollar company"" has so many elderly employees working for 8.25/hr, some of which have worked there for 47 years, that have never received a raise? They keep their non-corporate management in the dark which leads to confusion throughout all of the departments. Communication in general between departments is lacking. The non-corporate management dictated by the uncaring, unseen, arcane corporate side neglects being direct in instruction in order to perpetuate the faux family atmosphere of the staff. The staff themselves live up to these standards of family, but the management continually makes new and confusing policies that do the exact opposite. Company propaganda has recently been pushed through that at the very least asks the employees to memorize and recite the company motto, and they go as far as to ask employees to attend wellness fairs with health screenings-- that basically hands over their personal information to the company to use how they see fit. Pay is horrendous. Even after a small raise I was still well under the reasonable living wage in my area. The management above me was not fairing much better as well as the management above them. No one there is satisfied with what they are paid. Where is the money going? Meanwhile the CEO, gave himself a bonus in the higher end of six figures while his lowest level employees are working for poverty wages. There are more than one employees who are sexually harassing other employees, as well as guests, who have yet to be reprimanded or let go. One employee, who was gender non-conforming, only discussing it through their personal social media , was even shamed into leaving the company by other employees without anyone in management addressing the bullying. This was not an isolated incident. Don't be fooled by the faux positivity and friendly atmosphere, the closer you look the more sour it will become.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm
