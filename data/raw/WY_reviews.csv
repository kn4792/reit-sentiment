I thought he would be a good influence and bring the company separate business on a standard approach going forward, however, in my opinion it has backfired and we are more separated than in the past. At present there is a lack of appreciation for long-term employees and recent layoffs tend to be people with 20 and 30+ years. Leaders that are being kept on not people oriented leaders, but systematic, results only leaders. This can work for a couple of years but after a while, with more and more employee benefits disappearing and this type of leadership, people will leave. This may result in a company that can only attract mediocre employees as high performers will be able to go elsewhere. The new president has NO value or appreciation for our rich history -- very sad as a long term employee. I have seen, participate and adjusted in the many, many changes at Weyerhaeuser, however, during all those changes an element of striving for financial success and caring for their employees has always been present.

During a meeting with HR present, I confronted management about their behaviors. They flat out denied statements they had made and referred to my recollections as absurd.

You will never be promoted. Promotions are based on whether or not you will do whatever managment wants. Have to be a puppet. Underpaid for the work you do. Benefits have been cut. You don't have time to use your vacation. Management asks for input on ways to improve, then ignores suggestions choosing to go with their ""better"" plan. You're given constant praise until it comes time for annual reviews. To be successful, you need to say yes a lot: ""Yes, I would love more work."" ""Yes, your idea is better than mine.""

Western Timberlands Employee,1.0,"Dec 14, 2017","Many open positions since people quit at such a high rate, which in itself is a red-flag. This place is only a great stepping stone to obtain another job.","Morale is in the gutter across all employees. Management, which has been inflated with middle managers, is flaky, incompetent, and does not have your back. Your chances of advancement depend more on the color of your nose than the quality of your work. Workers who excel are pigeon-holed in their roles while inept employees are bounced upward. Developmental training is reserved for those pre-destined for advancement (see above) and as a carrot to keep disgruntled, but essential, employees from quitting. Pay increases are withheld from entry-level to first level workers despite bring promoted and having more responsibilities. Necessary business tools, such as cellphones, have been ripped away, and you must now pay for the privilege to be on call 24/7. And don't expect to get any comp time (you WILL be working well over 60 hours/week and on weekends). Also, don't expect a work/life balance: departments are ridiculously understaffed, and your manager doesn't have one, so you won't, either. HR cannot be bothered to pretend that they even care about you; at least they're honest (in a sense).",Weyerhaeuser,WY,Timberland,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Weyerhaeuser-Reviews-E730.htm

They shut the whole mill down except the kilns then made me drive an hour in the weather, for a week straight, just so they could catch up on inventory. Told me they would make it up to me. Not only did they never make it up to me but they put my life and my families future in danger. They also abuse their salaried employees.

Even if leaving for lunch I was to report my time which was closely monitored. The manager I reported to directly told me I was doing great work and he didn't know how to coach me because I was doing everything right, however, the mill manager of the site I supported was uncomfortable working with a woman so I was let go; even though I demonstrated an exemplary performance record and received several accolades from upper management in corporate. I received several suggestive advances from on site management and regret not reporting it even though it made my daily tasks uncomfortable.

The location of the corporate HQ is physically moving to Seattle from Federal Way and the culture has been in a constant state of flux for years. I guess none of these things in and of themselves are bad and some of the changes may end up being really great for the company.

Don't misunderstand, I have worked elsewhere, to others safety is a word given lip service, here it is the real thing. Some things, however, need to be dealt with common sense. A lot of talent and experience is wasted because of ineptitude, ego, and territorialism by middle management. Meetings, and the voluminous amount of Emails don't help me do my job; a Manager and Planning Dept. that are there to support me would. Work Orders that tell me my housekeeping responsibilities, or the need to review upcoming jobs for parts etc waste your time and don't benefit me.

Would not recommend,2.0,"May 7, 2018",Working in the Seattle HQ is a big step up from the dinosaur buildings in Federal Way. Management seems to think that employees place a financial value on the work environment though and we are told that our work environment is 25% of our compensation.

To tolerate the high demands of work here you have to be able to truly leave your work when you leave the building. I always felt like I was failing (despite positive annual reviews) and when I told my manager he said he understood, that he also felt overloaded, but that we had to just persevere.

Good company with great benefits but....,3.0,"Aug 9, 2020","Pay is above the normal for entry level, benefits are pretty good, opportunities to advance are good and working under the call list means you get some long breaks between shifts sometimes. Once you make it into a shift (out of the 4 available) then you can work 4 on 4 off and make a bit more money.","Working once a week on maintenance days which means you have to clean and remove very dirty, Dusty and wet debris from under very hot conditions and in between very confined spaces and dirty machines... Inhaling lots of saw dust on those days is bad... Really bad... Those days it makes you ponder why you are there. Also the senior Reman guys have a thing for political complaining and are never happy. Some of them don't have to work on maintenance days and have it so good but yet complain like no one else. If they like you then they will recommend you for a position otherwise good luck. In general management is ok but most people there think is really bad compared to the past. Safety is huge in this company and sometimes extreme but necessarily. The exposure to radiation although minimal is there as well as asbestos... It's everywhere. So be aware. As a mill this are expected but to be mentioned. It's hard to get along with most people there as they have worked there for 30+ years and they have an old school mentality.

Keep looking forward for the economy to turn around. This is a great company to work for.,4.0,"May 28, 2009","Weyerhaeuser is a company that doesn't just talk the talk. They actually uphold the values they claim. When they say employee safety is the top priority they really mean it. Safety is actually a metric that has direct monitary impact on compensation from the executive management all the way down to the front line. This is also the reason that for 2008 they actually achieved a less than 1.0 recordable incident rate, and this is for a forestry company with loggers and mill workers. I think this is a testament to the leadership. 2007 and 2008 have been extraordinarily difficult times for the company financially. A great deal of extremely talented folks were let go. I can't say this for all of the areas in the company but I know that I felt like I was always in the loop with were we were and the reality of a layoff months before it actually happened. The strong ethical approach the leadership displayed really helped to emotionally deal with such a large layoff of some of the world's best talent in the industry. When things turn around for the economy, I have no doubt that this same leadership style will continue. There is a reason the company has been around for 109 years and a Fortune 100 company.",Not really enough vacation time compared to other companies.

Company was well positioned to catch the full force of the recession: 3 of the 4 major company divisions are tied to housing (Real Estate, Building Materials, and Timberlands), so it is still reeling.
