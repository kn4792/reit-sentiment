Things Could Have Been Better!,3.0,"Feb 12, 2023",They take a chance on those with no mortgage background. Everyone is very helpful when they can be.

There's a lack of transparency with what is going on with the company behind closed doors. it's hard to get promoted, especially if your are good in your roll. Can be extremely over-worked.

Very disorganized organization but good experience,3.0,"Jan 27, 2023",Got good experience in manual /Non QM underwriting (valued when going to other positions) Lunch paid for twice a month Was lucky I had a great manager,Where to start lol - can be very stressful. Loans are complicated and can take hours to underwrite. I am lucky I an a naturally fast learner and can teach myself because they kind of throw you to the wolves and it is not the easiest learning how to manually do everything and with their system High stress enviornment - conditions could take as long as a new loan. You were constantly swamped when it was busy. Also if you had a bad underwriting assistant then you work could double. Luckily i had great ones The AEs are brutal and most of them are cutthroat. Wont accept a no for an answer and will go over you to get a yes. The annoying part is - sometimes management caved to them and you would be put in uncomfortable position of approving something you would not sign your name to Hours could be long and even when you take time off you could almost not enjoy it because leading up to it you had to make sure all your loans were mostly taken care of - otherwise people would moan and whine about it when you came back. Also when i said that i liked to leave work for hour lunch ppl laughed and said you’ll quickly leanr you cant here.
