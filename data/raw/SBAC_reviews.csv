Great Company,5.0,"Nov 4, 2025","I worked as a Data Management Specialist at SBA Communication and had a truly positive experience. The company fosters an inclusive and collaborative culture where employees feel supported and valued. I was trusted with key responsibilities involving data integrity and compliance, and I appreciated the opportunity to grow professionally. The benefits package was competitive, and leadership encouraged continuous learning and development. Highly recommend SBA to anyone seeking a strong foundation in a well-run organization.",None that I can think of.,SBA Communications Corporation,SBAC,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SBA-Communications-Reviews-E9253.htm
Huge Layoff,2.0,"Jul 29, 2025","Work from home, had a great team","SBA Communications is a $26 billion company, but you’d never know it by the way they treat their employees — especially part-timers. There were no benefits, no growth opportunities, and no recognition, despite continued hard work and dedication. The most alarming part was how the mass layoff was handled. There was no warning, no transparency, and absolutely no communication from leadership. One day we were doing our jobs; the next, we were cut loose without notice. It showed a complete disregard for the people keeping the company running. Management is completely out of touch. There’s zero motivation or support, and remote employees are treated like they don’t exist. We were excluded from conversations, updates, and any real engagement. It was a “work-from-home, forgotten-at-home” experience. They have the money and the resources to take care of their people, but they simply choose not to — especially when it comes to part-time or lower-level staff. The culture is top-heavy, and the leadership operates in a bubble with no concern for the wellbeing of the broader workforce.",SBA Communications Corporation,SBAC,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SBA-Communications-Reviews-E9253.htm

Remote work: they only allow 56 days per year and it’s super structured. I guess they want to remove it because they impose countless obstacles. Vacations: 19 days, but you can’t take more than two consecutive weeks—awful. Management: they reward controlling and authoritarian supervisors over good leaders; in the entire shared services, people leave like a revolving door.

Toxic HR Team,1.0,"May 2, 2024",Some colleagues and my role,"The attempt at a modern workplace culture did not resonate with the reality of it. The views on the modern flexible, work/life balance were often stated but not truly believed in by leadership. Despite the growing need for a company’s support for balancing personal/professional lives, it felt like walking on eggshells for those wanting to use their remote time or needing to flex their schedule. Besides that, the HR team fostered a phony work environment, especially amongst older employees’ “clique-ish” behavior. Only those that were “in” were taken care of in regard to compensation, etc. The leadership team met change with resistance and was stuck in their ways, which was frustrating for the younger generation. Communication was terrible and decisions were often made without the team’s input or with any regard to how this will impact them. “Leaders” get promoted without knowledge or experience of the role and without knowing how to speak to team members and be actual leaders – if they’re “in”, they are protected. Lastly, if you resign, they will post your backfill significantly more than what you were making, when you were told that you were at the max and there was nothing they could do.",SBA Communications Corporation,SBAC,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SBA-Communications-Reviews-E9253.htm

When i was there, they had a 1 day-a-week remote policy wherein you had to ask for permission every time you wanted to work remote - depending on who you worked for, having to ask for permission made it almost impossible to take remote time. 3. HR department is extremely toxic - you have to be in favor with the CHRO, and if you're not, you are not going to get any place - there is extremely high turnover for an HR department, and if you're not a favorite of whoever your manager is, it can be difficult. 4.

Good culture. Work life balance. Recent efforts to improve career advancement.,5.0,"Apr 19, 2023",I definitely recommend SBA. - Good culture. Nice people. Collegiality is real here. Top to bottom. - Integrity. Integrity is not only preached but it's shown. They lead by example. - Work/life balance. Vacations are respected. Work schedule is respected. They treat you as a responsible adult. - Benefits. Great. Even pet health insurance. - Office. Great space. Love working from here. I understand some people would want more days of hybrid work. This might not be important for some people but it's the defining reason when others evaluate a job offer. The company should look into it and be less resistant. - Efforts. This company makes an effort. They not always get it right but they try. They should however double their attention on items that have been needing fixing and are still outstanding.,"- Career Advancement. Pay at SBA is fair. It's not great, it's not bad. The only way to make more is to get promoted or moved to a higher position in another department. Promotion routes are not clear for several positions and the company loses and has lost talent because of it. Although a lot of effort (yes, a lot) has been put to change this, the general feel in the company is that it hasn't worked out. A lot of attention is put in cross-departmental movement, which indeed works well at SBA, but less is put on same-department movement. That recipe helps better entry-level position holders or generalists that can easily pivot. Not easy for specialized functions. The effort is appreciated but the problem remains. We are losing and will lose more talent because of that. Millennials and Gen Z are not as patient as prior generations. - Pay. The pay is OK. If career advancement remains a challenge, the company should start paying more. A mix of aggressive bonus practices and/or intralevel increases are a good start. - Flatness. Flat hierarchical structures contribute to the problems above. Create more levels. Or sublevels, for that matter. Offer a little bit more money by sublevel. It costs almost nothing for the company and it helps the employees to feel seen. The entitlement is real and it's here to stay. It's a generational thing. The company does not fix it by leveling up.",SBA Communications Corporation,SBAC,Telecommunications,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SBA-Communications-Reviews-E9253.htm

Advancement is non-existent in some areas. Concerns, suggestions and constructive criticism is not accepted and there is retaliation from management if employees attempt to address any concerns.
