Great Company to Work For,5.0,"Sep 19, 2024",Alexandria really does prioritize it's employees. Everybody owns their piece and put in the best work possible. It's a sophisticated operation and run very smoothly. Input from employees is absolutely taken into consideration. You definitely have to be a self starter. Mostly everyone is a team player. Compensation is fantastic and benefits unmatched.,"The work is not always a walk in the park. There are a lot of moving parts and you have to love striving to be better everyday. There's a lot of hats to wear, that's exciting for some people and extremely overwhelming for others.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm

Overcoming Status-Quo,5.0,"Aug 25, 2019","People/Culture: Slightly intimidating when I started because everyone is smart and driven. At the end of the day, you realize everyone is working towards the same goal of providing a good product to management and investors. Given all the stress that comes for working for award-winning company in the real estate industry, these are some of the nicest executives I've worked with. They're so passionate and so into the details that sometimes it comes down to the amount of clouds in a picture. For some it might seem like micromanaging and nitpicking, but it's almost silly how much they care about the disclosures. Benefits: Medical, dental, vision, new parent leave, volunteering time-off, anniversary bonuses, 401K, NYC marathon sponsorship, regional team building activities, the list goes on... Company sponsored opportunities: The company provides many workshops on specific areas including communication, presentation and writing skills. As well as mentor programs which allow for collaboration with other departments. Work-life balance: Management maintains a very detailed accounting calendar. It may seem daunting at first, but it allows you to plan ahead and work towards deadlines. After working for the company for a short period, my living situation changed and I thought I'd have to leave. However, they provided me with amazing flexible working situation, which they've offered to many others in different regions.","I could go on and on about the great things about this company. But no company is perfect. They have their problems. But when problems do arise, I feel that management makes the effort towards addressing the issues. I feel the motto is to avoid the status-quo and to continuously strive for improvement and that's a rarity to see in a company.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
Everything always comes with a catch,1.0,"Jun 26, 2019",This company had the best benefits I have ever seen. Free food all the time. 70 a month fitness reimbursement. Stand up desks. Sponsorship into the NYC Marathon. 9% 401k contribution after your first year. All health care covered 100%. Great pay. They also pay overtime for those below supervisor.,"With all of those great pros, there has to be a catch. The catch is they don't really have realistic expectations. They expect you to drop everything to cater to the needs of others. Managers and above expect you to stay late to finish a project so they can review the next day and they don't review the next day. You never know when you are going to stay late because deadlines are pushed. There is no flexibility at this place. It is very cliquey. The rest of my team would go out to lunch together after messaging each other and then come back and ask me why I didn't join them. Probably because I was not invited. When I started, I already felt like an outsider looking in. The controller never acknowledged my presence or even looked my direction when she walked past me. She would talk to everyone else though. They are also very nitpicky over every little thing. If you don't use a certain word that someone likes, it needs to be fixed and go through the entire review process again.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
Best career decision I've made. No regrets!,5.0,"Mar 11, 2018",At Alexandria everyone is committed to doing the best work possible. Everyone is very smart and focused. We are treated very well and we know top management cares about our professional development and overall well being. Therefore we always ensure that we are doing top quality work and show our appreciation through our work product. One of the things that really impresses me about Alexandria is their commitment to volunteerism and giving back. Being a good citizen is something that you don't always see in the workplace and knowing that here this is something that is encouraged by providing us with 16 hours of paid volunteer time off a year is quite impressive. Being successful is great but we should always remember that we must give back and help those in need and Alexandria places great emphasis on that. This is not common at other workplaces. Making the decision to work at Alexandria has been the best career decision I've made. No regrets!,I really can't think of any cons to write about!,"Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
Best Professional Decision I've Ever Made,5.0,"Jun 26, 2018","There are too many to list without creeping into full-on gushing territory, so here are a few: *Career growth is encouraged, and there is a clear path upward *The company does a lot of philanthropy work and encourages its employees to do the same by providing 16 paid volunteer hours, and a donation to the non-profit of your choice if you volunteer 25 personal hours in a quarter *Top-of-the-line medical benefits *The work that this company does directly supports scientific and technological innovation *The culture is one of positivity and dedication to your work, and your colleagues *There is a lot of emphasis on and support for professional development *Fresh fruits and veggies every day, breakfast twice a week, and lunch once a week *Subsidized nutritious snacks and drinks *They make their employees feel appreciated by providing competitive compensation *There is a concerted effort to increase diversity and inclusion On a personal note, I feel insanely lucky that I got a job here.

Having to pick between high pay and benefits or a better personal life,2.0,"Apr 3, 2022",The pros of working here would definitely be the above market pay. If you are below supervisor level you get paid overtime. Health benefits are 100% covered by the company. Started the position remotely and was able to adjust easily to the remote environment. The company is very strict on hiring. Employees must fit into the company environment. Everyone working there is very smart and helpful. The company provides yearly mentorship programs and despises to learn.Of course there are company politics that we will get into the next section,"With any company, there are always cons. Here the cons would be the super long working hours even when it’s not month end or quarter end. No work life balance at all. The processes are very manual and there is no willingness to change those to make them more efficient and with the modern times. Very stuck in their ways. Not much room to grow or move up the ladder. People mainly stay due to the above market pay and amazing healthy benefits.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm

From what I've heard they are working on it. - Very busy. Not really a con as I enjoy being busy, but just be prepared. - They haven't fully embraced the work from home/remote yet. (Pre/post covid).

It's a team environment where everyone wants everyone to succeed - which I feel is a rarity. The Company Culture - Purpose-driven. Caring. Values their people and treats us better than family. Alexandria's culture of volunteerism and philanthropic efforts are deeply inspiring. The Compensation & Benefits - Best-in-class. The Wellness program is phenomenal. Have you ever heard of a company sponsoring the NY marathon for their employees? Also, you will not go hungry working at ARE - and you're fed healthy, nourishing foods. The Work - Should you be willing to put in the time and effort, your work product will be the best you've ever had in your career.

Good Place to Work if Not Part of the Accounting Department - No Work Life Balance,3.0,"Apr 29, 2019","Salary is good - senior accountants are paid hourly and it is an above average salary (not Netflix level though, note supervisors and above are salaried so that sucks), which is good for the overtime, Disadvantage is you work a lot of overtime. Benefits are really good, they pay for all your insurance for you and your family. They also pay for 9% of your 401k (after a year of working here). They provide free breakfast every Monday/Friday, and lunch every Wednesday. Good place to advance your career. They are hiring a lot and are always looking to promote from within. You work with really hard working people and helpful people willing to help you advance your career and develop professionally. Company is also willing to pay for training, and spend a lot of resources on company culture (they purchase a lot of training materials, ergonomic office products for you, free food, good holiday parties) The best thing is the dress code if you work in the Pasadena office (since there are no tenants) - you can wear casual. Saves a lot of time on dressing /dry cleaning/etc Someone else also mentioned the philanthropy work and how the company encourages its employees to do the same by providing 16 paid volunteer hours, and a donation to the non-profit of your choice if you volunteer 25 personal hours in a quarter . Yes, this is true, but every quarter, only about 3 employees out of 200 (in Pasadena's Office) actually get 25 hours done. It is a good pro, but there is a reason only 1% is doing it - there isn't that much time, and you get backed up on work if you miss even one day.","Watch out - they have a VERY tight close. No work-life balance, which can be really difficult for those who have kids, or want a life outside of work. You are expected to provide ""white glove service"" to the non-accounting groups. This means a lot of things - you need to respond very quickly to the non-accounting departments. That means dropping all your work and focusing on answering/helping others (even if it is not a very important ask), and it can be difficult to get work done. This also means the managers who review your work are very nit-picky, which is good, but it can be judgemental if they don't like wording of something (then you need to spend 30 minutes trying to fix it). You also have several people reviewing your work, so it can take awhile. It's like the Big 4 when it comes to accounting, but a little worse since you don't get those early days off (only once a quarter...and you don't get to work from home at all). No flexibility at all. It can be really frustrating - good luck trying to schedule something to do on the weekdays - it can be very hard to expect when you have to stay late or need to leave on time for an event or kids appointment. Or even to go out to meet friends for dinner. They also expect to get your work done before you head out to whatever event. It can be very draining since it can be very hard to predict your schedule. I have worked long hours at other companies, but this company wants things done ""today"" - you'll need to cancel or push your plans back a few hours. You can't even get the option of pushing work back until tomorrow most of the time - the reason being that it has to be reviewed by your manager, controller, etc (several rounds of review). That can be frustrating when you cancel plans today, get the work done, and then it still isn't reviewed today/tomorrow. I've also sat around on a Friday evening waiting for another department's input to finish some work - manager wanted it done that day. Had to cancel Friday plans. It was awful. If you have company training, good luck - they expect you to finish your work within the same deadlines as if you didn't' have company training, and then you end up working overtime, but I guess you can make extra money. A disadvantage of being in the accounting department is also the titles - you see other people being promoted from senior coordinator directly to director or analyst to director (finance, asset services). That doesn't happen with the accounting department. You'll be going from senior accountant -> supervisor -> manager. The non-accounting departments don't work as long hours too. Must be nice to get better title bumps, and have better working hours.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
"Good benefits, good people, good work",5.0,"Oct 18, 2022","Health insurance (for family too) and life insurance fully paid for. ARE pays into your 401K based on % of your gross income which is immediately fully vested regardless of whether or not you invest yourself. Big bonuses and competitive base pay (plus overtime pay if you work it). Typically only supervisory roles are salaried. People do care about you here. If you're sick, you get to stay home while people cover for you so you don't return to a mountain of work. If you're REALLY sick, the company uses it's resources/network to find you help by some of the best doctors/facilities in the US. Good place for people who don't like mundane work.

Strong mission and ethics,4.0,"Oct 24, 2016","My previous employer had a specious (at best) philosophy about how they approached business, so to step into a company with such a committed and strong approach to what they do is incredibly refreshing. Strong work-life balance with outstanding benefits and a casual atmosphere. People are friendly and professional and upper management seems to be genuinely interested in their employees, seeing them as the main reason for the success of the company, rather than expendable game pieces.","From what I've seen, internal advancement varies from department to department, so if that's something that is important to you, make sure you're clear about that when interviewing. The organization of the company is siloed, so it can be challenging to get a big picture on how the various departments work together.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
Dream Come True,5.0,"Oct 11, 2016","Where to start? I worked for the same company for 14 years. I resigned myself to the fact that working for an employer meant always coming in second to the bottom line and never feeling appreciated. When I started looking for a position I was contacted by a wonderful recruiter from Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) and I immediately checked the Glassdoor reviews. I couldn't find much and I was very disappointed. After my fist interview, I knew that this company was different and I was shocked that people didn’t have more to say. Not only is the company close to home and located in a very nice area of Pasadena, but every person I interacted with was bright and excited and genuinely loved the company. I know...you want the Pros....here is a short list but please keep in mind that I still learn something new every single day. 1. Amazing benefits. No exaggeration. Seriously amazing benefits. 2. Every person I have interacted with has been bright and friendly and the environment is warm and welcoming. 3. I work in the Legal Department and the work-life balance is amazing. I actually look forward to work on Monday and I never believed that was possible. 4. Employees are given everything they could ever need to perform their duties. No one hurts for anything so we are free from the distraction of begging an angry supply warden for a pencil. 5. My favorite thing so far is that our CEO and Founder actually addresses the company, shares his thoughts and celebrates our accomplishments as a company. His emails are encouraging and supportive and show a real appreciation for the accomplishments of every employee and not just the big guys. The environment has felt fresh and innovative from day one I have had a sense that change and improvement are encouraged and appreciated and not feared and suppressed. That is incredibly refreshing. 6. Food, food and more food. No one goes hungry at Alexandria. There are always wonderful treats and healthy options available and it really brings a smile to everyone's face. ARE is extremely generous and it never ceases to amaze me how much more productive and happy I am never worrying about being hungry. There is no way to list all of the wonderful things about ARE. All I can tell you is that I am happier than I have ever been before. I found an amazing position, working for a company I love and believe in, our CEO is someone I respect and appreciate and all of my friends are jealous of the benefits and the ""perks"".","None. In a truly collaborative, welcoming and rewarding environment, it has been difficult for me to find any cons. The location is great, the people are great, the company's mission is something I can stand behind and our leadership is passionate about contributing something wonderful to this world. ARE is successful but has not lost sight of the backbone of any successful organization, the people. Everyone is treated with respect and the usual pettiness many of us have seen in previous positions is missing. As an employee, I have felt welcomed, cared for and important since the day I started and it gets better every day.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm

"Fantastic Company and Mission, but with a Growing Storm on the Horizon",3.0,"May 3, 2021","The pros are quite literally too numerous to list. The long lists of benefits (one of if not the best medical dental and related packages offered especially including family, yearly 401K vestment by the company with no employee contribution requirement, meals dining reimbursements and perks when the offices were open pre-covid etc.) outlined in some of the recent high rating reviews are correct in their assessments. With that said, all that glitters is not gold, and there is definitely a tradeoff, a cost that comes with these wonderful benefits.","The cons or tradeoff mentioned above would have been minor and those found at any company prior to a week ago: highly competitive environment, constantly busy sometimes to the point of overwork etc. The company would have been rated 4.5/5 stars a week prior, the only drawback being the bit o a cult of personality and secrecy as other have noted. However, a new company policy announced last week has changed that to bring the rating down substantially. The company just announced a mandatory covid vaccine policy in order to return to the office. This policy will unfortunately result in valuable employees leaving the company whether by their own choice or being forced out. Will it be 1% of the staff? 10%? More? At what point does this policy become untenable and unviable, too painful for and harmful to the company to try to enforce? The question is, will this loss and harm outweigh whatever perceived ""benefit"" this policy could possibly bring, particularly in light of the following: 1) the vaccines are FDA approved for emergency use authorization, with full and formal approval expected at the end of this summer or early fall at latest. 2) most of the offices are not even reopened or planning to reopen any time soon, particularly corporate headquarters in Pasadena which rumor has it won't be reopening prior to next year. 3) does the company have a policy of a formal, documented vaccination requirement for any other vaccines (i.e. MMR, polio etc.)? If not, would this not qualify as an inconsistent and discriminatory policy? 4) multiple recently conducted surveys have shown roughly 50% of employees would look for other jobs if forced to return to the office full time (search results show one survey conducted by a staffing company indicated 34% would quit or actively seek other employment, another indicated 58% would do so). I worry this policy will yield close to if not similar numbers. This is a rushed, not well thought out policy opening the company up to liability. So why not wait to implement this policy until the vaccines are fully approved, and on a per-office basis as they reopen??? Or better yet, have those who are unvaccinated sign a waiver of liability, especially since this has a 99.8%+ survival rate. And those who have been vaccinated are protected against covid, right? I mean that IS the whole point of the vaccine, because if it doesn't work then why take it? It's not a matter of not trusting the science or being anti-vaccine. But coercion, social conditioning, fearmongering and threats are not science.","Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.",ARE,Health Care,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Alexandria-Real-Estate-Equities-Reviews-E6956.htm
