Really impressed with this company,2025-09-08,"After spending a decade in big tech, I was surprised to find a company that takes many of the great attributes and leaves the negative aspects of many other big Silicon Valley corporations (in my experience since being here 1.5 years). From the comprehensive (and fun!) multi-day, in-person onboarding trainings, to company-wide volunteer days (IMPACT Day), social events that embrace different cultures and celebrate diversity - Prologis is a company that invests in its employees. I also appreciate that it routinely asks employees what it can do better, and listens. Teams are continually driving towards excellence - whether that’s finding a more effective process or implementing new technology to help teams work smarter. But in my experience, being “human” is still valued. People lead with kindness and empathy in a way that feels really genuine. The cascading effect creates a team dynamic that is pretty rare in my experience.","For those that love remote work, we’re currently in the office 3x/week (may vary based on the team).
