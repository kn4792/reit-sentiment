One of the Best Companies I've Ever Worked For,5.0,2024-09-13,"#1 is the culture at Prologis. People are kind and generally trying their best. We work hard but we pause to have fun. I also love that each region has their own sub-culture that makes it fun to visit, learn, and collaborate. Leadership has a vision for the company and genuinely cares about its people. The company is headed in the right direction. Some of the newer departments are still in startup mode figuring things out and can be messier, but there are a lot of things to be excited about and customers are overall happy with the products/services offered. Prologis is a company that practices what it preaches. We actually, seriously, care about ESG and reducing our impact on the environment, compared to other places I've been where it looks more like greenwashing. I feel well compensated for my work, and for the most part my work/life balance is fantastic. It helps that we get lots of vacation time (that I actually feel comfortable taking) and even a few days off per year to volunteer.","I would love to see more diversity in exec leadership roles (women, POC, and age) for fresh perspective. But I will say this has improved even in the few years that I've been here, and DEI is a newer group that has been established. As a global company, we have the challenge of communicating across geographies, time zones, and languages.
