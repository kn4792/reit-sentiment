The C-suite leadership team is approachable, genuinely interested in each employee, and consistently makes decisions rooted in integrity. They emphasize doing the right thing and ensuring our operating partners have the tools they need to prioritize resident care. A standout example is the EVP of Asset Management—my direct leader—who embodies these principles and has done so consistently throughout his 30+ year career. His leadership style reflects the company's broader culture: a balance of high expectations and accountability with kindness, support, and authenticity. I’ve been with the company for just over a year, and I can confidently say these values are not just aspirational—they are put into action every day. The positive culture at AHR is evident across every service line and flows directly from the top down. Leaders recognize individual employee strengths and make a concerted effort to set people up for success, both personally and professionally. It’s important to me to work for leaders who not only speak about principles and values but also stand firmly behind them.

Home and work life balance is horrible,2.0,"May 31, 2021",The pay is competitive And the benefits package is decent,"The property managers and field teams are inundated with work and antiquated processes. The title property manager itself is disingenuous because the property managers DO NOT manage and aren’t allowed to make decisions. They are processors, highly micromanaged and a catch all for escalations, many of which could be avoided if the company took more care in streamlining drawn out processes and overall efficacy. The company strains both the field and PM departments by setting high expectations while providing very few resources to complete tasks in a timely and quality manner. It’s as if they only care about making money, not doing the job efficiently. Many of the Atlanta property managers and field team members are overwhelmed and feel burned out.

Penny Pay Produces Poor Performance,1.0,"Jun 29, 2014",The best part of American Tower is the day you walk out the door for good!,"I should have known better than to accept when I was offered my position and attempted to negotiate a minute pay increase. I was told, ""It's non-negotiable,"" which pretty much sums up working at American Tower. From the day I started until the day I left, they were concerned about numbers (as in more pay for upper management and horrible salaries from middle-management down). CEO Jim Taiclet earned more than $12 MILLION in 2013; Chief Financial Officer Tom Barlett earned more than $4.5 MILLION in 2013; President Steven Marshall earned more than $4.2 MILLION in 2013; Exec. VP William Hess earned more than $4 MILLION in 2013; and Exec. VP Edmund Disanto earned more than $3.8 MILLION in 2013. The company scrimps in regard to across-the-board company salaries - again for middle management and below - and tends to hire fresh-out-of-college graduates who will work for pennies on the dollar - only to leave at the first growth opportunity. As for customer service, I worked with great people, who cared about the industry and client goodwill; however, with the limited resources (as in too few people for too great a workload), staff just could not provide the ""premium"" level of service on which American Tower supposedly prides itself. It is a shame that American Tower does not understand the simple concept, ""You get what you pay for.""

"Lackluster Company: lacks innovation, etihics and employee value.",1.0,"Jul 22, 2015","Compensation and benefits is the main objective keeping current employees in their positions. Stocks, bonus, holidays and once you hit 6-years full vacation are the main positives. Usually collaboration amongst your own team mates is positive.","Directors, managers and upper management do not listen to concerns and process improvements that the core groups who majorly contribute to the companies success. The core values the company ""exhibits"" are of face value only to maintain a corporate structure. Many have witnessed situations where one employee on a team is an issue and causes others to loose privileges and other benefits instead of holding the individual responsible. HR pushes things ""under the rug"" there are managers and employees who are never held accountable for their actions, lack of contribution, quality work, poor leadership, negativity and rudeness and even retaliation against people who stand up for themselves or try to involve HR over serious issues. Sadly a lot of issues go unreported due to fear of losing your job. The Corporate office in Boston is completely disconnected from other offices, decisions are made involving processes and procedures without cross-functional understanding which severely affect day to day operations. Data quality is extremely poor between the main office and other teams leaving others to ""clean up others work"" and told ""It is easier for you to fix than us"" Teams are often ""put down"" during conference calls by the VPs despite their continued hard work and effort to preserve the data quality and enhance customer experiences with the company.

You were constantly swamped when it was busy. Also if you had a bad underwriting assistant then you work could double. Luckily i had great ones The AEs are brutal and most of them are cutthroat. Wont accept a no for an answer and will go over you to get a yes. The annoying part is - sometimes management caved to them and you would be put in uncomfortable position of approving something you would not sign your name to Hours could be long and even when you take time off you could almost not enjoy it because leading up to it you had to make sure all your loans were mostly taken care of - otherwise people would moan and whine about it when you came back. Also when i said that i liked to leave work for hour lunch ppl laughed and said you’ll quickly leanr you cant here.

Clerical Assistant,1.0,"Aug 25, 2018","Exceptional design and cleanliness to the Columbia office building. The CEO there at the time Mr. Griffin was very personable, smart and diligent.","This was by far my worst job ever. I was offered a job as a low-level clerical assistant working with the two teams, the legal department and investments team. This was my first full time job straight out of college and I absolutely dreaded coming to work everyday. I would go weeks without seeing my manager for the investments team, so many worked and assisted the legal team. The assist I worked under was the executive assistant to the VP of Legal and she did nothing but all day but suck up to her boss while talking about her behind her back and boss me around. She treated me very awful, and would raise her voice to me over little things I did wrong to the point where I would go home crying every day. But, at the same time I felt bad for her because she would be treated twice as as worse by the VP, so most days I let it go. The remaining members of the legal team I worked under were extremely pretentious, rude and unprofessional. I left after only 6 months of being employed there and I decided to resign after I met with my two bosses VP of Legal and VP of Investments for my three month performance evaluation, which conveniently took place 5 months into my employment. At that time they decided to advise me that my performance was subpar and I was taking too much time off from work, mind you I had braces on at that time and needed to visit the Orthodontist pretty often. They explained I was negative and rude to my counterparts, and at that time they were probably right because I had had enough with my coworkers yelling at me and treating me that way.

"Great Company, Terrible Department",2.0,"Nov 20, 2024",Contact center agents work from home which is convenient. The benefits are excellent and I feel the founders do care and try to show their employees that they are valued overall.,"Training: Training was inconsistent and unorganized, leaving you feeling unprepared to start the role. There are well over 30 “guides” you can pull for reference but in real time, during a call, it can be cumbersome as well as stressful trying to research when the conversation lengths and hold times are being monitored. There is also information and regular updates posted in Microsoft Teams regarding updates to guides which only makes it more difficult to locate information you may need as you have to check multiple avenues for the most up to date information. If you attempt to reach out for help as encouraged, via the “supervisor on call line”, you are made to feel like you are disturbing them and are incompetent for asking questions. Environment: The environment is incredibly micromanaged and your performance is intensely scrutinized. You are graded on 3 types of calls a month resulting in a performance grade for the service you provide. They also hop in and “live listen” to active calls, sometimes commenting in real time via Teams and distracting you from the task at hand. Email, text and chat templates are in place for you to utilize and the supervisors review every email you send. It feels at times they are looking for reasons to “coach” you. As an agent you do a little bit of everything and are held to the highest level of perfection while wearing multiple hats. You are yelled at, berated and degraded routinely by the callers and are regularly held accountable for mistakes that are not your own. If there is ever a time someone on site, at one of the properties reaches out pertaining to how you handled a situation, even when handled by the very specific guidelines that are put in place for you to follow, via the guides, the supervisors will almost always immediately side with them and imply the agent is incompetent and did not do their job correctly, only intensifying the feeling of being undervalued. In the event you ever have a bad day, or show the slightest indication that you are human or your demeanor in a call is seen as rude, you run the risk of being fired. This department has the highest turn over rate I’ve ever experienced at a company and if things continue this way, so will the turn over rate. Management: The management team initially gives the impression they are kind, supportive and open to feedback however this quickly changes once onboarding ends. As mentioned before, it feels uncomfortable reaching out for help however this is complicated by the extensive micromanagement and the fact that you are not allowed to make decisions based on your experience or without ensuring they will approve. Again, you have guides to reference however there are many instances where the situation is considered a grey area and again, you are not allowed to make decisions for yourself as there are rigid guidelines to be followed. While you are encouraged to be “transparent” and reach out if you ever do have concerns, the moment you do, you are gaslit and it’s implied you are the issue. You run the chance as being seen as problematic and unprofessional, even when bringing concrete examples for what your concerns are based on. There were multiple agents that were targeted and ultimately fired after they expressed issues they’ve had with the leadership, the work environment and/or training. Some even went to HR for assistance only to be met with the same end result. Unemployment. Culture: There are a lot of nice things the company generally does for its employees from holiday parties to employee appreciation day. The contact center specifically has customer service week and the supervisors have fun raffles for the department which is fun and very nice. They also send birthday and anniversary gifts which is also nice. It’s important to note that there is a severe imbalance of diversity in this department. There are 10 or 11 leaders in management and they are all Caucasian except for 1. There were multiple leaders that have left the department only to be replaced with more Caucasian leaders that had not been in the department as long nor performing as well as other agents, including agents of color. There have also been multiple agents of color that have left the department and/or company due to not being given the opportunity for growth after repeatedly requesting the opportunity for advancement. This is disappointing and disheartening to see. Compensation and benefits: The benefits and perks are excellent. The pay is just okay and due to the rising cost of living, it is barely enough to scrape by. New agents are making $6-$7 more than those with experience and tenure in the department which is discouraging. This department is 24/7 and Camden boasts itself on having 24/7 customer service for residents and prospects however the 24 hour option is put on the backs of only 6 overnight agents. The contact center never closes, so while you get paid for “paid” holidays, you do not get all of these days off like the rest of the entire company. Also if you work on any of the holidays, you do not get paid the standard, time and a half holiday pay for working on said holiday. There is also not premium pay for the overnight team. You are given a yearly bonus and raise however, they are distributed by agent preference and not by performance. A colleague and I received the same exact bonus and raise one year though I had been there a year longer and my performance numbers were much higher. When you attempt to discuss your compensation with leadership you are again hit with gaslighting and told it is not in the budget.",Camden Property Trust,CPT,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Camden-Property-Trust-Reviews-E2418.htm,negative,0.016023710370063782,0.699460506439209,0.2845157980918884,-0.6834367960691452

"Used to be great company, now completely toxic",1.0,"Sep 18, 2023","Daytime hours, mostly get out on time.","SO much hypocrisy-upper management puts out ridiculous videos purporting to thank field teammates, and they are so out of touch and full of false statements. It's embarrassing that fellow teammates praise them. Noses firmly attached to posterior.... Horrible customers at some locations, including violence or threats of violence, but we do not have the authority to terminate rentals. Our safety is clearly not important. Rampant unfairness-some employees are off every weekend, despite being hired to work weekends, while others are required to work 6 days for months at a time. Those same employees are not required to perform tasks to standard, creating more work for the others (the ones that are still trying, that is. A lot of us are just doing the minimum now). Company touts their customer service awards, but the truth is, these awards are because employees are harassed constantly to leave these reviews. There is an ""engagement"" survey every year. It asks the wrong questions, and the same things are given low scores every year. This demonstrates the culture of promising but not delivering. Lies, in other words. Mission statement includes: ""simplify the challenges their customers face through innovative solutions, unparalleled service, and genuine care."" I am certain that NO customers will agree that ""Unparalleled service and genuine care"" include 60-75% rate increases, cameras that have not worked in several years, mold growing on walls, and offices that are closed unexpectedly for a week at a time, due to corporate refusal to adequately staff the stores. The hypocrisy blows the mind. It's all about numbers. People do not matter. at. all. Employees are shamed publicly and penalized, if their numbers don't meet a certain standard. Customer base, location, and circumstances do not matter at all. Being shamed publicly is an example of the corporate toxicity-upper management visited stores recently and made personal remarks about an employee's appearance that were designed to humiliate and degrade.

Diamond Rocks!,5.0,"Aug 18, 2016","DiamondRock is a real estate company focused on the hospitality industry. The basic function of the company, to own hotels, is an exciting premise. I mean, who wouldn’t want an occupation that is the real-life equivalent of the Monopoly Man? The hotel business is an industry that is rooted in taking care of hotels that, in turn, take care of employees and travelers. It is an industry that has a meaningful impact on the daily lives of many people. The company is very well organized and operations run smoothly. The team is talented and motivated, with employees working hard to continue to help grow the company. DiamondRock is also a responsible corporate citizen and a great member of the Bethesda community by offering opportunities for employees to participate in local community service initiatives (also, read on to discover my notes about Bethesda later). The executives of the company are very approachable. The company prides itself on good communication, and it is easy to speak with the company’s key leaders. The executives make it a priority to ensure that all employees are aware of major directives, projects and goals. Also, the executives have an open door policy for questions, which is pretty cool. Now on to the important stuff. There is a snack room with unlimited, bottomless, snacks and soda (at least three types of pretzels at all times)! If you want to set a new personal best for afternoon soda consumption, there will be nothing stopping you. There’s even a really high-tech coffee machine that I’m convinced you can only operate if your previous employer was NASA. Also, there are a variety of entertaining informal and formal social events that help employees get to know each other in a more informal setting. And now to address a slightly controversial topic, the office’s location in Bethesda. Since the good folks at Glassdoor.com do not have a category for items that have both positive and negative attributes (NOTE TO GLASSDOOR: create a category for things that are boths pro's and con's), I’m placing this squarely into the positive attribute category. Pro because there are many hospitality industry companies in Bethesda, which creates a lot of networking opportunities. Pro because DiamondRock’s office occupies the best location in Bethesda, right on top of the Bethesda Metro Station (Red Line), and within three blocks of about 100 shops and restaurants (note, this is an approximate count and probably cannot be relied upon as an official statistic). Con because you are not in city-center Washington, DC. Bethesda is a small city where the majority of the workforce departs the area after the workday has concluded. However, Bethesda does have its perks if you need to finish up some last minute holiday shopping, replace an I-phone that you recently dropped while swimming in a lake, or find a tailor to mend your suit because your best friend decided to elope and only provided you with three days’ notice (it happened).","Although DiamondRock is a mid-cap public company traded on the NYSE, the workforce does not consist of that many people. Choosing to work at a small versus a large company is a lot like choosing to attend a liberal arts college or venture to State U. At a small college, everybody knows your name while at a large school you have the benefit of complete anonymity until a professor finally inquires where you have been all semester. Just note that at DiamondRock you won’t find an internal intranet with postings for 500 open positions, but you also won’t be required to attend a two-month training program at some spooky Upstate New York corporate campus.",DiamondRock Hospitality Company,DRH,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DiamondRock-Hospitality-Reviews-E38038.htm,neutral,0.028045523911714554,0.09443353116512299,0.8775209784507751,-0.06638800725340843

When employees ask “who qualifies for stock options?”, no one can give a straight answer. The HR department is the most unprofessional I have experienced in my 10+ career in real-estate industry. Incompetent, incapable, and completely useless. The HR department experienced nearly 100% turnover since 2015. Everyone with talent in that department left. Pay increases, bonuses and payroll is horrendous and run by an incompetent manager. There is a huge lack of union and employee knowledge within the HR department. As for the Operations and Finance Departments, they will work you 90+ hours a week and it’s still never good enough. Increases and bonuses are laughable in comparison to the hours worked.

"Great Company, Management in my department wasn't that great",2.0,"Aug 10, 2012",You do get to meet and work with some great and demanding people. Clean upscale work environment. Easy access to the company from the entire DC region. Mr. Marriott is very easy going and had some great Christmas parties. Plenty of work and not sitting around wondering where is the work.,"Pay was very small especially for this area and amount of work I did for them. I started working here after several years out of work due to the recession. I knew not to take this position because I didn't like the manager during the interview, but was desperate for a job and pushed into it by family members. The employees and manager had also told me about all the prior people working at this position that never stayed or were fired. Since my dismissal, they have gone through numerous employees and still cannot find someone ideal to work with them. I had to deal with a manager that blamed all of her problems on her employees when she was the one creating the problems, was constantly in to work late and left early and only worked 3 or 4 days at the company a week. I look back and realize some of the things she did not do or had created problems with is actually quite funny, I realize how much better off I am now that I don't have to deal with her anymore. Many, many times I was left to do a certain amount of work that was meant for 3 people. One small complaint from an employee about me being late for their appointment or anything else turned big with my manager even though I may have still been working with a VP or CEO on an issue and keeping from making it to the other problem. Department Christmas party was extremely embarrassing, management literally got drunk and was singing and such in a very well known restaurant while a few of us were sitting there wondering how much more time do we need to be there.","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.",HST,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Host-Hotels-and-Resorts-Reviews-E305.htm,negative,0.012284152209758759,0.8887581825256348,0.09895769506692886,-0.876474030315876

Legal Theft,1.0,"Jan 25, 2024",Income was decent during low rate environment. End of Pros.,"Company looks for every avenue in which to exploit a LOs job security as well as commission payouts. Micromanaged every minute of every hour of every day, with the threat of being terminated held over your head daily. Absurd metrics that must be met on a daily basis. Calls are recorded and monitored by a 3rd party company, by people who's only job is to make sure you read every single word on every single page of the company's 10 page sales script. You miss one word and you are hit with a critical fail, which not only places you in the termination pile-but the company then keeps your commission on that loan when it funds. Technology that is spotty at best, taking up to 30 minutes simply to get logged into the system. If you're more than 5 minutes late logging in to your shift, you are written up -all because Pennymacs servers are bogged down and won't let you in. Multiple months in which I would miss hitting 125% payouts on commission by 1 funding unit-only to see that unit literally fund the very next day on the 1st of the next month.

Avoid at all cost,1.0,"Mar 6, 2019",The job itself is so easy a trained chimp could do it.,"Upon meeting a coworker, the first words out of their mouth were ""welcome to hell"". Not exactly a ringing endorsement for what lies ahead. You'll spend a few hours a day making collections calls to the same customers literally every other day. You're forced to lie to each customer about insurance and how ""its required per your rental agreement"". Support from management is non existent. In the month I was there I emailed and spoke to management in person about when my public storage polo and jacket would arrive. The email was ignored and the in person request were shrugged off. This left me in my street clothes looking very unprofessional. 3 days after I quit I received a call from management to do a post mortem. I explained that I felt no support from the higher ups. instead if taking that in, he kept try to throw my trainer under the bus by asking if something went wrong during training. I assured him that my trainer was great but, it fell on deaf ears as he kept insisting I blame someone by name. Management will shuffle your schedule around to keep certain employees who don't get along separated, instead of trying to address the issue. This creates a toxic culture filled with back stabbing and personal insults. It also lets employees think they can do what they want, when they want. This includes but is not limited to; closing the store to run around town taking care of personal business while on the clock. Your kid is getting out of school early today? Great! Just lock up, grab the kis from class, maybe some lunch and come back to work when you please. Feel like starting a fight with a coworker? Wonderful! Lock up shop, hop in your car and head across town to yell profanities at your peers with zero repercussions! It's an open secret that a certain property manager will close the store for hours to drive for Uber. This has ""allegedly"" been happening for several years now. Seems like a pretty sweet environment to work in right? Zero room for advancement. If you're hired as a property manager, that is where you'll stay. Despite being told in my interview that there is plenty of room to grow, all of management is an outside hire and not one of them has experience at the store level which makes them super relatable... Long story not so short, my limited time here showed me everything I need to know about an awful culture.

"Should have taken these other reviews as warning. Single parents, listen up.",1.0,"Jun 1, 2023","The wonderful history within the Ryman and the Grand Ole Opry. Saying that you work for either of them always garners impressive comments from others. But that don't pay the bills. Pay is okay, but not for the amount of unneeded stress you'll endure.","HR department is terrified of communicating with anyone who's not ""top-floor"". Highly tout ""hybrid, flexible workplace"" when interviewing, but please don't be fooled. You'll get one day WFH/week at best, and they make you feel bad about it. The corporate office is more cliquey and catty than a teen movie. The amount of bickering that goes on between leadership roles over the dumbest projects and deadlines is laughable. If they'd spend half of the energy expended on that (or the inane team-building exercises you're forced to endure) lord knows what kind of heights this company would be taken to... And it's not like the company is doing terribly - they're rich as balls and like to tell you about it, as if it's also in your bank account as well. ""Hey everybody, come see how good I look!"" As I said, single parents - listen up. I'm a single father of 2 very young children, and from the day that I was hired, I was up-front in communicating that I needed to make full use of their so-called flex-time and remote policies, as there are times where I have no control over what time I need to leave the office in order to pick up my kids on-time. I was CONSTANTLY bullied by my direct supervisor over this, requesting that I submit my arrival/departure schedule to her WEEKLY for approval, though it never changed. Well, that wasn't going to happen. I was terminated because of this, and it's wrong on so many levels. Mental health is not a concern for leadership or HR. If you disclose you have a problem and need help, they will single you out. Also, get ready for all of the most cliché meme-worthy moments possible in a corporate setting. Pizza parties to celebrate record earnings in Q1! Teambuilding exercises at an escape room. All the gaslighting you can take. Take heed and go elsewhere. This place doesn't have the legacy of any of these historic brands they manage in mind, just how much they can earn. I get it, we're all in business for money, but take care of your people. Lastly - Diversity & Inclusion is touted as a top priority in this organization, but it's laughable. It all comes down to making sure there's a token person of color in all marketing materials, that's about it.","Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.",RHP,Lodging/Resorts,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Ryman-Hospitality-Properties-Reviews-E697429.htm,negative,0.023654600605368614,0.5487502813339233,0.4275951385498047,-0.5250956807285547

"Large Company, Lots of Layers",1.0,"Jun 13, 2016","Good salary, pretty good health benefits. Good 401k matching perks after minimal time of employment. If you are willing to relocate to move up, there are options because of the quantity of centers owned. Daily work life at the center level is decent if you have a good GM that serves as a filter.","Long holiday/weekend hours for all center management staff plus you're ""on call"" 24/7, hard to juggle this with a young family. Too many layers of management and you have to get approvals on almost every little thing even though center mgt. is said to be empowered. Very heavy administrative load - the amount of paperwork and approvals necessary to do anything is ridiculous and inefficient. A few personalities above me were more concerned about their bottom line (read: bonus) than the well being of the center. I was not involved in the decision-making of hiring other managers at my own center but rather was just told her the choice was being put into place. When I needed help while short-staffed, those in the regional positions to do this hiring purposely stalled on interviewing and getting someone in place. At the same time, another regional was slow to respond to requests for help and when he did, the response I got was ""the expectation is that you will just handle things until...."" Too much paperwork for bidding, paying invoices, leases, pretty much anything you want to do. Constant pounding to cut costs even to the detriment of customer amenities (while pushing us to increase customer amenities - with no dedicated budget). Daily requests and emails to fill out corporate spreadsheets, surveys, reports, etc. We received so many that we got additional email reminders with due dates just so we could keep them straight. All of this took away from actually managing the center. So many policies and procedures that's it's difficult to hire qualified individuals and train them on everything because it's so overcomplicated. Marketing programs are sent to the centers to be executed, so there is very little creativity for mktg. directors onsite other than to sell, sell, sell and make more for the bottom line. They have too many cooks in the kitchen to be effective (ie: too many bosses giving them directions). Basically, the management job was overall just very frustrating. After being in management and serving as a filter for all the directives coming down to us from all directions at the regional and corporate levels, it just because exhausting. ""The Funnel Effect"" is what one staffer called it - everything above just needs one little thing but by the time those ""one little things"" funnel down to the center, it's a million little things we have to react to (surveys, spreadsheets, databases, etc.) and usually nothing comes of them.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm,negative,0.022018402814865112,0.5474367737770081,0.43054479360580444,-0.5254183709621429

I have over 25 years professional experience in my field and was followed watched and treated like a 5 year old kindergartener. The manager would not get the things I ask for to do my job without many times getting the wrong product as they believed they knew what was needed even though I would give exact stock numbers and store location of product needed. I worked hours on end in 95 degree weather without a break and when I finally took a short one to change my soaking shirt and get a glass of water I was basically told they were going to fire me so I left before they could.

TPG Fort Worth is where dreams come to die,2.0,"Mar 28, 2021","-Everyone is interested in doing what’s right for investors -Great business- TPG is always ahead of the curve and thinking outside of the box -TPG hires great people. Just about everyone is intelligent and competent, and nice to work with -Senior management is out of San Francisco and holds high standards in terms of diversity and inclusion, which is heavily supported by FW management. The company is especially supportive of LGBT employees -The support employees give to charitable initiatives is truly heartwarming. There are some ongoing charities the firm supports, and employees go above and beyond to support these causes. For example- care packages for the troops, fundraising for the cystic fibrosis foundation, and a clothing drive for an LGBT teen homeless shelter showed everyone jumping in with their donations and their time -All the free food you can dream of (pre-pandemic) -Company is taking the pandemic seriously - everyone is working from home","-Massive divide between the “front office” (SF) and “back office” (FW). From the perspective of SF, back office is nothing and the only interaction between the two offices is through a few very senior individuals. There’s no understanding or appreciation of all the work that goes on in FW to support front office. -Crazy amounts of turnover. Considering that TPG has a great business, a respected name, pays well for the market, and hires the best, this shouldn’t be. -Crushingly hierarchical. Strong attitude by management that everyone should “stay in their place” and that only the most senior should have their voices heard. And even then, even the most senior often have no control over their careers. Job functions will change on the whims of management, even if it doesn’t make sense. Some of it has to do with the high amount of turnover, but uprooting the entire way the system works isn’t the way to plug a hole -While there are so many smart and competent people around, it’s more likely that an incompetent person who knows how to throw around business buzzwords and play the politics game will get promoted -I’ve never seen so many great people so beaten down by a place – management has no regards at all for the interests, background, or skill sets of employees. It doesn’t matter what you are hired to do- the job you were hired into can change out from under you out of nowhere, or you could be plucked out of your job at any moment and thrown into a new role you have no interest or experience in. Don’t get too comfortable with the manager who hired you- that’s very likely to change multiple times -Nothing ever improves- people are rarely left in a role long enough to become proficient and begin to improve the process and make things more efficient. Constant thrown-in learning mode. If someone doesn’t feel like doing something, they can just ignore it until everyone’s job changes again and it’s someone else’s problem. Manual processes galore thanks to expensive new systems put in that are only 90% of the way integrated -No training. Sink or swim mentality -Culture of fear. When something goes wrong (and it will) and it makes the “back office” look bad, management is very quick to point a finger at someone and fire them. Because of this blame culture, people are hesitant to take ownership of things. Because nobody takes ownership and jobs change so often, there’s a lot left up in that air that doesn’t end up getting done","TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc.",TRTX,Mortgage,2025-11-21,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/TPG-Reviews-E6060.htm,negative,0.02347872406244278,0.5129570960998535,0.4635642170906067,-0.48947837203741074

"High Bar, High Reward",5.0,"Sep 23, 2025","I’ve been at Ventas for just over two years now, and I’ve seen this company shift from good to truly great. When I first joined, there was energy and ambition — lots of “we can do more” — but more recently I feel like we’ve found our stride. The leadership isn’t just chasing growth; they’re being very intentional about how we grow, where we invest, and making sure we build sustainable advantage. For a large S&P 500 company, the corporate team is surprisingly small and nimble. You actually see the outcome of your work and feel connected to what’s happening at the top. There’s not a lot of red tape — people focus on the work and on doing it well. The pace can be quick and priorities can shift, but that comes with being in a company that’s looking ahead instead of playing catch-up — and that’s a good place to be.","It’s a small, high-performing team with nowhere to hide.

The oppressive culture of micromanagement is deeply rooted within my team. My managers exhibit an incessant need to oversee every minor task, going as far as reviewing my emails before I can even send them out. This level of oversight leaves little room for independent decision-making and stifles any potential for professional growth. For those considering a position at this company, it's essential to be aware of the high turnover rate.

You had to work every holiday except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years.

I had to work sick tons of times because they wouldn't let me call off. You could only get an annual raise if you met their sales goals consistently.

My Opinion but Your Choice,2.0,"May 27, 2023","(Field work pov) You get to meet a lot of different people on your team and your customers. Depending on you or your team, tough days can easily roll off your shoulders with ease with the help of each other. Treat you customer with compassion (regardless of the situation) and you can make the most heated customer your best friend. Don't be shy to say hi! People can be very kind. The better you get to know the people you work with, the easier work becomes. As long as you are given respect and time to be trained, then you can easily grow quickly in the company. You'll learn a of new skill that you can apply in the future. Also , great way to connect on the business side of life. Lot of fun events. Make a lot of good friends. Forgive me, there are probably more pros, however I seem to be having an issues balancing them out with the cons.... That however, could be due to my own relationship with my job positions, and other experiences here.","(Field work pov)They expect you to do more than humanly possible. A lot of jobs positions have been discontinued through out the years in a blink of an eye. This puts a lot more stress and problems on the ones that remain. Plenty of employees have been pushed to take care of other properties and their own. Now a lot of positions require you to do ""hybrid"" jobs. Not the kind that you come to work or stay home, hybrid. But the kind where you're stuck doing four job positions in one. Delegated right with a respectable team and your time, it could be possible to make it through. However, I would not doubt your mental and physical health rapidly decline due to the amount of stess. Always watch the ones who gossip. Especially, if they are senior workers that are know around the company. If you're a new employee and they don't like you, you might as well quit. They will not let you get ahead for a second. No matter how good you are. They'll take away any confidence you had in yourself. It is not below them to bully you into quitting or pushing others to fire you. They will pull any excuses to do so. I mean ANY. Because they worked there for so long, the company/team will let them get away with it. Unless, you have a strong / fair higher-up and supportive team that'll stop it beforeit gets worse. It's like highschool all over again, folks. When in a toxic environment, if your boss hasn't confronted you about a situation at work, and they write you up for the smallest things, leave! Most likely the are trying to fire you anyways, and they won't stop until you are gone. Oh, and they will tell your teammates of your work/personal unfortunate circumstances and then some. You'll know when you're not welcomed anymore. Even if they smile at you. Especially, if they leave their work space to go whisper something to another, and you're the only one else in the area. It could be their own personal issue. However, if you are experiencing anything from above, I wouldn't count on it. (Also, lower rank positions get pick on just as much. Doesn't matter how long they've been there.) As much as I hate to say it, depending on the location, the teams can be extremely toxic. So please be careful of your mental health. It can and will effect your physical health over time if not taken care of. Burn out is real, and some choose to ignore the signs of their employees. Just assume they already don't trust you, and get a doctor's note. Better safe that sorry. Because of everyone being so overwhelmed with their jobs already, you are not likely to get proper amount of training, and you'll need it. If, however, you have been in the same position and just need side notes than you'll probably be fine. Keep in mind, a lot of changes are happening, so you might not know the same programs. Good luck finding someone who does or has the time. I won't even discuss pay. Just keep in mind the work and time you put in. Oh and take your lunch away from work. Give yourself that mental break. You're going to need it. If you want a challenge, this is it. If you have a good team, in good health, mental ""normal"", multi tasker, works well under pressure, open minded to change, handle unhealthy amount of stress, confident, and ok with the possibility of your position being cut, then go right ahead. But that all depends on what you pursue, and the people you work around. Sometimes it doesn't matter how longer you work here. It could also be how far down the latter you are in the company.","Simon Property Group, Inc.",SPG,Retail,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Simon-Property-Group-Reviews-E2458.htm,negative,0.015097263269126415,0.8003237843513489,0.18457892537117004,-0.7852265210822225

Opportunities & Growth: If you put in the effort.,5.0,"Apr 11, 2022","I have worked for Essex for almost 6 years, starting out as an Assistant Community Manager at one of the East Bay Communities. The Essex that I started with has changed considerably and is only slightly recognizable. Generally, that can seem like a bad thing, but instead, it shows that we change with time, feedback, and what associates and residents are expecting. The changes can sometimes be slow, and sometimes they happen at a breakneck speed - but they allow for each associate to develop new skills and provide better working environments, tools, and employee/prospect/resident experiences. If you adapt, learn, and grow - you will see that you are provided with more opportunities and challenges. Throughout all the years at Essex, one thing remains absolute - there is always help and support.","As mentioned above - some changes happen slowly or quickly, and sometimes the changes can have an awkward acclimation period. Back-end departments are working on making rollouts less cumbersome, but just do what you can as you can. Some of the opportunities that came up were sometimes opportunities that should have had a larger compensation package tied to them, but over the years that has seemed to dissapate as an issue.","Essex Property Trust, Inc.",ESS,Residential,2025-11-20,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Essex-Property-Trust-Reviews-E3630.htm,neutral,0.08056002110242844,0.3066401481628418,0.6127998232841492,-0.22608012706041336
