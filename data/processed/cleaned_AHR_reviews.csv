An Amazing Place to Work — Where Integrity Comes First,2025-05-08,"American Healthcare REIT is truly an amazing place to work. The C-suite leadership team is approachable, genuinely interested in each employee, and consistently makes decisions rooted in integrity. They emphasize doing the right thing and ensuring our operating partners have the tools they need to prioritize resident care. A standout example is the EVP of Asset Management—my direct leader—who embodies these principles and has done so consistently throughout his 30+ year career. His leadership style reflects the company's broader culture: a balance of high expectations and accountability with kindness, support, and authenticity. I’ve been with the company for just over a year, and I can confidently say these values are not just aspirational—they are put into action every day. The positive culture at AHR is evident across every service line and flows directly from the top down. Leaders recognize individual employee strengths and make a concerted effort to set people up for success, both personally and professionally. It’s important to me to work for leaders who not only speak about principles and values but also stand firmly behind them. I can say with full conviction that American Healthcare REIT lives up to what it promises.","While no company is without its challenges, I have yet to encounter any significant shortcomings at AHR. The culture here is so strong and positive that it far outweighs any minor issues that may arise.","American Healthcare REIT, Inc.",AHR,Health Care,2025-11-17,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/American-Healthcare-REIT-Reviews-E7171082.htm,"American Healthcare REIT is truly an amazing place to work.
